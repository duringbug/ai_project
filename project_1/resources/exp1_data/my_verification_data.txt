She actually made some jokes that raised my eyebrows since she is now a lesbian. I didn't like this because it seemed hypocritical but I think Wanda Sykes is really funny. She is one of the few comedians who can make me really LOL (Laugh Out Loud). If you want to see what her comedy was like before she came out a lesbian or you are a Wanda Sykes fan, watch it. I am a huge fan of hers. I would like to see her in a live how. I am glad she is true to herself now and came out as a lesbian. I hope Wanda keeps on making me and others laugh for a long time to come."}

I had heard of the series previously but was only convinced of buying it after seeing an intervewi with the actress. What a suprise: this is a somewhat lesscorrect version of Friends meets My Name Is Earl. I agree that this may not be correct at all since this series has no respect for conventional moarl issues such as lying about having cancer, discovering a friend's grandfather was a nazi. It also tackles the strange love men sometimes has for guns ets... In some ways it is difficult to describe and understand if you have not seen this gem of comedy."}

Devito showing up in the second season gave it a little boost as he's always dependable for turning the mundane into the hilarious.It's basically about 3 jackass friends in Philly who own a bar and get themselves into offbeat situations.  What I liked best is that it is not the clice venue for the young and the beautiful.  It often hi-lightes the old and the ugly and in doing so cultivates a good portion of the laughs.Worth you time and money....bg"}

Watching the whole seasons through, it is obvious that while Adam and Jamie were younger in this season they were also a lot angrier at each other. Perhaps they learned each others quirks as the seasons progressed but it is interesting to go back to the early days. You can also view how the budget for the show started increasing over time as their initial experiments were low cost and generally done near the shop, now they have massive explosions in man made lakes and mining quarrys.I recommend this show to my friends and it is often discussed in the work place.

My favorite thing is that unlike Dora the Explorer or Diego, no one *ever* encourages the audience to be loud. Also, while they do &#34;play Blue's Clues&#34; in every episode, the shows are not all the same. The structure changes slightly each time, which is fantastic.

One odd complaint--the Nickelodeon &#34;intro&#34; is MUCH louder than the rest of the cartoon for some reason, and that's consistently true across all of the Dora and Diego cartoons.  When watching you may want to adjust the volume down (or mute) until the intro is done to save your TV speakers and possibly your ears.  The cartoon itself is cute and well-structured for younger children, that eventually understand what Dora is asking for and the order in which things happen on the show.  My 2-year-old girl loves it and would watch an entire season straight through if I'd let her.  It's the first cartoon like this to really capture her attention for an entire episode so that alone makes it worth the recommendation for younger children."}

{"label": 0, "raw": "The very dated soundtrack hurts this otherwise OK 70s crime drama. All the suspense scenes are marred by the hokey Dave Grusin score, which sounds like a dippy 1960s TV show. Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Massachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film. Everything moves a lot more slowly, and many shots needed tighter editing."}

My theory is that after years of being out of circulation it's reputation exceeds it's actual artistic worth.  Everything here is aces, though.  Good direction, atmosphere and writing.  The acting is superb with the stolid Robert Mitchum leading the cast.  I particularly liked Steven Keats' gundealer and Richard Jordan's duplicitous fed.  I think we've been spoiled by the high quality of films in this genre with Sidney Lumet's \"Prince of the City\" and Martin Scorsese's \"The Departed\".

I imagine how cool it would be to travel to other worlds through a stargate/wormhole and meet other people who of course speak my language, English.

While Shepard is no Jack O'Neill he has started getting his own personality it seems that fits the series well and while the super model leader Teyla still feels unneeded she has become somewhat less annoying in the series as well.

This was the consistent psychological thread that deepened the murder mystery and gave the audience a super meaningful connection to Veronica Mars.  All of the characters from her childhood were grappling with a question: to what extent are we unable to throw off genetic proclivities and childhood traumas and other cultural influences in order to walk our own path in life?"}

I was very pleased so many cast members returned to do the movie. I think they all liked the series also. Why did such a fine series disappear from view? I don't get it. What they have on now is a big marathon trying to say that all girls have sex by 14! Well bull to that. Watching Veronica Mars, it made virginity serious and precious. When she was raped at a party, what woman would not feel her loss. The relationship with her father is a rarity in American viewing. She was raised by a single Dad who loved the heck out of her and expected her to love herself. He supported her, but also guided her. Bring her back. We need this series. Thanks for the movie, but it only made me want more of the story."}

One refreshing note among many, how realistic to see Logan put his hand on the wall when they we r e going to kiss after he embraced her. Instead of the usual &#34;slam her head against the wall&#34; (Arrow).

I just don't want to be the one to give it to them to watch.  Leaves me in a bad position for a PG13 movie.  Why did Veronica have to grow up and have such a mouth.

Luckily we don't have to see that.  What we do see is what would happen after a  nuclear exchange.

It goes without saying that this is one of the shows to look out for in 2008.

Henry VIII went down in history due the creativity of his marriages and his religious beliefs.  His daughter from Anne Boleyn turned out to be Britain's greatest monarch so something came out of it.

Don't get me wrong their should be women fighter pilots but because they were 2 of the main characters practically every episode was about sexual intrigue, jealousy, and who's sleeping with who this week. Secondly, they use bullets instead of lasers. My guess is the producers did this to save money on special effects. Third, the society of this advanced culture still has people smoking and alcoholics and they haven't even cured cancer. A society enlightend and advanced as this(at least 100-200 years or more advanced than earth) would have cured the addiction of smoking and acoholism and/or outlawed it. Almost every actor was a drinker, smoker or both. I suspect tobacco companies and alcohol beverage companies paid the actors and probably the producers under the table to smoke in the series.

It was interesting to see Ellen's character slowly begin to change from the innocent, trusting young lawyer, to the suspicious character portrayed by Glen Close.  The show really is all about trust.  The key line that sums up the entire season is spoken by Close's character Patty Hewes, &#34;Trust no one.&#34;  Not exactly a great message to instill in people, but it works well in a TV drama about lawyers.  Other than Ellen and her boyfriend David there really aren't many characters in this show worth admiring.  Everyone is lying to everyone, which makes it difficult at times to figure out what is really going on, but as the old saying goes, &#34;The truth has a way of rising to the surface,&#34; and all lies are revealed.

Seeing the particular class type of people in that episode portrayed sympathetically just nauseated me. aside from that episode and the unexplained departure of Barek & Carver, it was overall a good season. And having seen Bogosian before as a villain in Under Siege 2, I really hated his character in the first few episodes, but eventually, I sort of began to even lioke the moron, even though my dislike of him resurfaced in one or two of the final episodes. and why wasn't there a second episode to the one with whoopi cushion?"}

Great to have in your library. You can watch them over and over a catch something you missed. Well Done great that Amazon has them available."}

{"label": 0, "raw": "Great Show!  Nerds and Spooks.  It's the perfect partnership.  Chuck, a Stanford drop out, working at the Buy More, gets an  email from his sort of best friend.  The email contains current and past U.S. intelligence.  The email imprints all this data into Chuck's memory.  Soon after, Chuck meets Sara and falls head over heals for her.  It turns out, she is his handler, and charged with keeping him safe, and the information intact.  This is the story of how Chuck grows out of being just a Nerd Herder, to a real spy with the help of friends, family, the CIA, and Sara.  It's a story of nerds, love, action, and comedy.  We love it."}

All of the actors from the primary players to the support cast does an excellent job.Chuck - the leader of the Nerd Herders at the Buy More gets an email from his former college roommate.  The email downloads a super computer into Chuck's brain.  Suddenly Chuck (a likable but aimless college dropout) becomes one of the CIA's most important assets.  To protect Chuck the CIA and NSA bring in two specialists - Sarah and John Casey.  The entire series becomes what happens to a normal old, every day guy when something really extraordinary drops into his life.  Throw in a little spy danger, some romance, and some crazy family and friends and you've got Chuck."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Yes, my inner-geek rejoiced minutes into the first episode of Chuck:S1, with the reference to Prince's \"Batdance\" song.  Constant pop-culture references are just one of the things that makes Chuck about the best show on TV and probably too smart to last very long.The cast is fantastic: from Chuck himself to Big Mike, Captain Awesome, Morgan, and even the cameo roles, everyone is well written with depth. Adam Baldwin is one of the most underappreciated comedic actors in Hollywood. Its a damn funny show, but more than that, it includes a little bit of everything, from suprisingly solid action to a dab of romance.My main worry is how long they can sustain the show's formula, from Chuck's memory flashes/missions to the tension between he and Yvonne Strahovski.

Free is a good thing and also a great way to gain viewers like myself.  I am hooked.  \"Life\" is not your run of the mill cop show.  Charlie is not your run of the mill cop.

{"label": 0, "raw": "Quirky, clever, and very satisfying, Life is an excellent police procedural that takes place in Los Angeles. LAPD detective partners Crews and Reese are perfect foils, seeming opposites that play off each other's best and worst personality traits in such a way that the viewer ends up liking both characters, a difficult feat. Actors Lewis and Shahi do an excellent job. Lewis' American accent is spot on, and Shahi (a very beautiful woman) does the tough-cop, no-nonsense, recovering addict role just right. Other characters/actors are also great. Although I wanted the series to go on and on (it was cancelled), please don't be hesitant to watch the 2 seasons that are available. The underlying mystery, developed a little at a time through each episode, is satisfyingly (if perhaps not completely) resolved at the end. I watched the last episode last night, and I'm a little sad now. I will miss Crews and Reese."}

The male lead is recognizable from the hit cable series &#34;Homeland.&#34;  Yes, it's another cop detective drama and there's always a murder to solve.  But there are enough other quirky plot twists and the murders also have twists.  You find out right away that the male lead detective was himself framed and spent 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.  So these various parallel plots and plot twists keep it very interesting. The acting is good and there is also an element of humor.  So all in all, it is a very entertaining series that makes you want to keep watching it."}

Recently I saw it come up again and decided to give it a second chance.  Am I ever glad I did.  I love this show!  I really like the format of it - the way the characters' actions and dialogue are set up.  Adding Alan Arkin to the cast was an excellent choice.  He's such a good actor as is the main character Charlie, played by Damian Lewis, who plays this insightful man who is so grateful for the simple things in life having been in prison for many years for a crime he did not commit.  Very refreshing!"}

His character, Crews, is eccentric but smart. He often looks like he is about to board the crazy train and then suddenly it all makes sense. Then he does it again! He is a little crazy and a little genius. Pretty obnoxious sometimes too."}

A cop, wrongly accused (not so surprising a plot----aren't they always???) but still I continued watching.  The interesting hook was that he not only took the references huge settlement but had negotiated to keep his old job as a detective in the same place that accused, arrested, prosecuted and jailed him.  Hmmmmm, different. The humor is a sideline to a jaundiced look at the new/former workplace and although I think the female partner's role is a bit over the top, the cases are interesting and the tracking of who actually committed the crime he went to prison for is well thought out and executed. Thank you.&#8203;"}

When this became available through Amazon Prime, I rabidly devoured an episode...and then another...and then all of a sudden, Season 1 was over and I wondered at how deeply engrossed I became in Charlie's story and how much I had grown to care about him and his partner, Danni.  So now I was craving to know even more of Charlie Crews, et al. An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  Now it on to season two."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "In the pilot, the look and feel of this show does for the Bionic Woman, what they did for Battlestar on the Sci-Fi channel( if not quite as gritty). Where as the original was just silly, this seems (so far) as a well thought out story, with people that we may come to care about for (good or ill).The subplots, of Jamie's reletionships with her sister, and evil crazy counterpart, for me (at least so far) make for good drama.They've got my interest, I just hope the show lives up to the pilot."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This re-make of the classic series Bionic Woman is not as wretched as some would like to say. Overall it suffers from a slightly dull athmosphere, and it is true that the writing could have been tighter but the acting is rather good and the effects are first-rate even if they are somewhat in the background. So the story is quite simple, underachieving bartender Jamie Summers is almost killed during an accident and re-built by her experimental-surgeon boyfriend. Afterwards it is quite straightforward. But as I wrote it is not as bad as some other reviewers put it."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I found myself becoming more interested as the plot lines evolved. The new show has brought in more technology than the original series, while keeping the theme similar. This version is darker and has more edge than the first series. The younger sister started out slightly shallow, but the need of having her watched by older adults was addressed early on in the series Now I think that both \"sisters\" are developing their sibling roles nicely. The actors that support Michelle Ryan have developed into a fine ensemble of people. I would like to see more of Mark Sheppard in future episodes. There are also danglers of plot in each episode. I hope the show continues. It has turned out to be a show I look forward to watching on my PC."}

The character development was basic, but adequate enough to show hints of other, less obvious relationships that I'm sure will  be cleared up,inlater episodes.  Overall a very good possibility for my interests, so I'll be watching."}

The funniest part in this show is the overt discomfort that is evident in these guys when they find themselves in everyday situations surrounded by dumb folk like you and me.  My favorite episode was when Sheldon got the flu and became the center of the universe (unto himself) and the great effort his friends went to in order to avoid him during his illness.

Enjoy the show, it is pretty decent...This season was a bit weird not having the old staffers with House but they did some rather odd things and came out ok.

One episode recently showed a woman who killed her son because he was so mentally ill and violent that she knew he would kill someone if she didn't stop him.  The wheels of justice were not weighed in her favor and the jury sent her to jail.  Why?  Because the prosecutor showed that she did it, not only to save humanity, but to save her marriage to the young man's stepfather and their two children.  So, because there was a &#34;selfish&#34; reason, she lost the sympathy of the jurors.  I wonder whether the verdict would have been the same if the Lanza kid from Sandy Hook had been shot by his mother before he killed all the childrent at that school.  Probably so."}

Some say it seemed a little rushed but I actually think it may have been a bit too much to have an entire 22 or 23 episode season of breaking out of a prison in Panama that only has guards on the outside. They do a great job once again of keeping you on the edge of your seat with this one.A lot more is revealed about \"The Company\" and the massive conspiracy, and of course, Burrows and Scofield find themselves neck deep in it. Some old faces and new alike with Scofield continuing to outsmart pretty much everyone makes this another satisfying and addictive season of Prison Break."}

You got Scofield dumped in the most horrific prison known to man.  You got Bellick walking around half-naked lookin' like something the cat dragged in, after it threw it up.  Mahone is going through some serious withdrawal issues.  And Linc on the outside pretty much clueless.  My boy Sucre is still hangin' around dedicated to Michael for all he's done.  T-Bag continues his menacing wrath. Newcomers, Whistler and Lechero and the vicious Gretchen a.k.a Susan B. make for some very interesting storylines.  I agree that that daggone writer's strike did make this season seems rushed.  It's all worth it though to see Wentworth Miller all hot and sweaty between a rock and a hard place."}

My only observation is that the some of characters acted completely... well out of character, and a lot of plot devices were used to move the weaker plot lines along.

Kristen bell is in this season, and the guy from the past (Japan 1871) appears to be a great addition.  I love to watch some of the old characters learning more about their past / families, and some characters are not sure what side they are on any more.  Who is the good team, and who is the bad team.  Everyone seems to have their idea on how a hero can save the future.  Someone learns that they have more powers than they thought they had, and are becoming more like their parent with the new found powers.  Think I am addicted.  :("}

The first season gave us the introduction of the hero characters and their individual stories and plots for why they did what they did,  the second and the rest of the season gave us more on the superhero plotline stories rather then the secret identity story plot it felt like.  While there are a few characters who felt they weren't needed it didn't detract from the enjoyment I got from watching the show, and for the price the set is going for right now I feel it's forgivable especially since this is the shortest season of the four seasons the show as on the air.  The video and audio are great with nice clarity and sound especially as you hear the background sound.  So again while this wasn't the greatest season it's still and enjoyable enough season to add to your dvd library anyway considering what the price for the set is going for it's a pretty reasonable bargain...."}

I would bet there are millions of detectives that would love to have that gift to help solve murders. For Raines, Jeff Goldblum's character, it provides the ideal vehicle for the hilarious, rapid dialogue Jeff is known and loved for. He tries so hard to fight the gift, but when it proves so useful, he then welcomes it. The fun occurs when the ghosts talk when he is with other people and he either fights answering or answers and  then has to cover it up.

Still it takes guts to remove major characters and the Samantha Carter character does a good job at being the bases new leader.

The groundhog day episode, the lucky rabbit's foot, the witch coven. the sixteen episodes are more solid a season that most can do with a full 22 episode season. All in all, it is vastly superior when compared to the previous seasons.The producers included a bit more than the standard fare of special features, more to help fatten the DVD load. There was almost no need for this, given the character growth and the strength of the metaplot. We still have 5.1 audio tracks and the CGI is a heck of a lot better.The season ramps up with a finale that we've seen coming for a year.

{"label": 0, "raw": "That pretty much sums up the theme of the film.  The immensely wealthy paterfamilias Ogden C. Osborne and the poor son of a masseuse Finn Earl are two peas in a pod, and Osborne sees that right away. Osborne has already triumphed, thanks to a little blackmail on the part of his grandfather, and you get the impression that Finn will do the same after surviving a very rough coming-of-age summer with the Osbornes and his ex-drug addict mother. It's about tribal behavior in a \"fierce\" primitive tribe studied by his biological father and tribal behavior in a \"fierce\" robber baron family headed by Osborne:  sex, love, murder, rape, jealousy, and all that human stuff that doesn't change no matter what costume you happen to be wearing or how much money you have."}

I've been wanting to see Anton Yelchin in something else ever since seeing him in \"Taken\", and I was really impressed by his role in this film.  I also wanted to see Kristen Stewart in something else, and I watched this one and another one she was in, and I'm extremely impressed with her.  I expected another Bella, but in both movies, she was totally different. I don't know what it is, how some actors can be so many different characters so convincingly.  some are basically the same all the time, but not these two extremely fine actors! Everyone in this movie played their roles to perfection, and I highly recommend it."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This series starts with lots of explicit scenes of screwing -- and ends up being a fairly deep meditation on love and loyalty and family.David Duchovny plays a washed-up writer who drinks, snorts drugs and sleeps with anyone who will sleep with him (and apparently there are many) -- but harbors a deep and abiding love for his former partner, about to be married to another man, and their 12-year-old daughter.There are many funny scenes as the series develops and we also meet an interesting supporting cast. But the laughs and the sex scenes become fewer as the story unfolds and the Duchovny character's inner sadness and longing for permanent connection becomes the dominant theme.I found this series a rather effective critique on the emptiness of the fast-lane L.A. world the characters inhabit and of our insistence on eternal youth which inhibits people growing up to become true adults."}

Although many elements are familiar (with wisps of \"The Shining,\" \"The Devil's Backbone,\" and numerous other classics...) the film still feels fresh.

Belen Rueda who plays the mother delivers a very strong performance and really holds the movie together. Worth seeing in theaters, even though some people failed to realize it was going to have subtitles and walked out. Don't people find out a little about a film before shelling out $10.00 to see it? I guess not."}

It's a pretty easy film to follow, even though this was played up to be a very spooky film, I found it to be more sad than scary.

{"label": 0, "raw": "I am a fan of Tobe Hooper who directed the original \"Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" and \"Poltergeist\" but this episode does not live up to his reputation.  The story is blurry, unoriginal and not scary at all. It is a tale that has been told many times before.  An angry demon of the earth, this time oil under the earth, enters the body of a father and the son witnesses his father brutally kill his mother.  Now years later it's time for the evil spirit to inhabit the son's body and cause mayhem and destruction throughout the town he lives in. The story has no real clarity, and there is a no suspense or thrills just mass confusion in the film and outside the film as a viewer.  It looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute.  If you want some originality and horror watch Hooper's Season 1 contribution called \"Dance of the Dead\" and save yourself some time and money here."}

The real beauty of this show is the ongoing family darama between Mary and her family as well as the shenanigans between her co workers.  As a member of AA for 13+ years I can tell you the family problems related to this are very real life and they show much of this with enough humor to make me appreciate the honesty.

The on screen chemistry between Colonel Shepard, Rodney McKay, Carson Beckett & later Ronan Dex were what (in my opinion) made it the better of the two &#34;Stargate&#34; series.While it will never measure up to &#34;Battlestar Galactica,&#34; (the best sci-fi show, ever) the two of them were a great mix as they both started and ended at the same time.

Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that.

I am not into bikes other than the creativity that goes into the custom bikes,  and never thought I would be interested in this show, but it is truly awesome for a TV show."}

Seriously who would NOT want to go out for a beer with jackson, Opie, Chips, Scotty, Juice or Bobby Elvis?? Clay is another matter. Then there is the comparative morality of corrupt politicians, cynical, venal government agencies and morally compromised businessmen. So they get into all of these wild escapades, nothing is ever what it seems and the SOA is always about 15 minutes from death, destruction and prison as one scheme after another backfires. Someone should make a reel of the many \"oh s***\" moments in the series, whenever someone says it, it has already hit the fan. But it is never boring. I guarantee that if you buy the series you will be up all night watching it, simply to see what happens next. Highest possible rating."}

Boy was I wrong. This show is like new jack city meets scarface meets the god father who then meets training day. Lol. I watched all 5 seasons in one week!!! I was totally hooked.  You actually see each character develop and you can actually relate to their plight in some strange way. You kind of start rooting for the characters although socially and morally there actions need to be condemned. Definitely more graphic and explicit than any show I have ever scene. At one point I thought this must be the unedited version.  But nope  FX is the new HBO for cable. Lol. Just started watching the new season 6 and it is very graphic as well."}

{"label": 0, "raw": "As I have stated, this series, in my opinion is just the best. The acting, scripts, and so on are wonderfully done. Morse is a fascinating person. He has the top education and is rather a snob on the surface. Deep down, he is a man with a good heart. He never marries, but loves women. He loves classical music and teaches the officer beneath him, to eventually do the same. I really like this series and do not tire of watching it. If you are a fan, turn to Endeavor to see how Morse begins his career choice in law enforcement. Amazon has it all. I find myself watching few regular television shows any longer. I spent all day, Sunday watching so many programs. Love Amazon Prime!"}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I agree with the reviewer JW. The best of the Morses are concentrated in and around the Oxford colleges-so that is perhaps why I only liked this season - very much -instead of loving it.The first episode is the best one, centering around the murder of a police inspector who is writing his memoirs, which includes a chapter on unsolved cases. The discovery of the theft of that chapter during the course of the investigation causes Morse to open a cold case, that of a 17 year old child murder --and its resolution has both moving and shocking consequences.What I always love in the Morse episodes is the dual thread story lines: in search of one thing, Morse discovers entirely neglected byways which lead him to the elusive truth. And it is no different in the other episodes which deal with the death of a feminist cleric, the murder of a local painter, the garroting of a Greek restaurateur and a trip to the Australian outback, which rounds out season five. Four and half stars."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This season of five episodes starts off with a complex plot: a detective who is retired is writing a book about his old cases, all of them successfully resolved, but one.  He is killed, and the chapter goes missing.  As Morse and Lewis dig deeper and deeper, several possible suspects emerge as to who might like to keep the information quiet, and who has the most to lose if the secrets are uncovered regarding the circumstances surrounding the crime and why it was never resolved.These shows may seem slow-moving compared to current mysteries, but the magic is in the script and acting.  Morse always has wise observations and his face is a joy to watch as John Thaw underplays the subtle emotions."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I just can't get enough of this series. He is so intelligent as is Sergeant Lewis his assisting officer. They have so much humanity and the underlying kindness and dignity they bring to the job is wonderful to watch. I also love the frequent classical music and the scenery is also wonderful. Taking place in Oxford makes it interesting to watch. The snobbery of some of the locals adds to the tension at times, but that car he drives....now I would love to sink into those leather seats just once for a spin through the coutnryside! Yes, Morse is the best. Morse is single and gives Lewis frequent problems as Lewis is married with two children. He has to really juggle the life to try to get home to the family. Often his personal dedication gets in the way as he too becomes obssesed with solving the crime. He is learning so much from Morse. He has even grown fond of the music which he once hated. Every season is worth watching."}

It wears well in spite of the number of years since it was made, just like Morse's car !  I am encouraged to find DVD's of other series featuring Mr. Thaw as I hope they will continue to quality.  Also, the location of Oxford is marvelous.  I got the companion DVD MORSE's OXFORD for a closurte look - I will never be able to visit Oxford in person, but felt like I had a nice private guided tour after watching this."}

This batman reminds me of the Bruce Timm DCAU batman with a twist of Adam West, and a dash of batman beyond's gear.

It has a lot of the same pleasures: attractive, quirky protagonists, great, elaborate scams (some of which are revealed and some concealed from the viewer until the end), and a great deal of humor.  Much of the humor comes from the characters' interactions: this is a team of folks who are used to working alone. While some shows are more inventive and compelling than others, they are pretty uniformly engaging.  Leverage is an easy addiction: a dependable good time."}

It combines the fun of the classic Robert Wagner series \"It Takes a Thief\" with the witty dialog of \"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer\" to create a perfectly entertaining and engaging confection.

In the whole first season, it seems like the actors aren't really that interested in playing their parts to the full extent of their talents.  As a drunk, Tim Hutton seems to drag the show down because he is the leader of the group and impacts all the characters, so perhaps he is playing his role perfectly?!?Maybe next season, the characters will show more life.  Although I can't recommend that you spend your money on \"Leverage,\" I recommend renting it first (or watching some of it on the Amazon Movie program if it is available), and then deciding if you'd like to buy Season 2."}

{"label": 0, "raw": "Having been in nearly the same situation more than once, I identified with the Phoenix character, though not with his bipolar problem. He falls for two women at once, but for different reasons. One seems like his backup plan in case the one he really wants, Paltrow, falls through, which she does at every opportunity because she is almost as unstable as him. In the end, the Plan B comes into play. Along the way, Phoenix delivers some realistic emotions, as do the two female leads. This is a very contemporary film, fraught with real adult desires and frustrations when we search for love and don't always find it perfectly."}

Interesting ending that would be worth the argument at a party with a bunch of opinionated men and women. Hey, that might be a reason to watch it!  There ya go!"}

That said the film does end with a nice resolution that perhaps points to emotional growth.  Its not the best film but its not the worse either.  I would recommend renting this before investing in owning a copy as I doubt its the kind of film anyone would want to see more than once."}

Even more, I enjoy that the original characters that drew me in--Foreman, Chase, and Cameron--play a more significant role than they did in Season 4.If you didn't enjoy the \"Survivor\" gimmick of Season 4, give Season 5 a chance.

I never would have thought the show would work with Tim Roth in the lead but he's terrific as are the other 2 main characters--you want to know what's going to happen to these people. And unlike another reviewer I liked how season 1 ended. These folks who study the science of lying have a gift, and that gift is both a blessing & a curse as you will see thru the first 13 episodes. Can't wait for season 2."}

I would recommend Lie to Me to anyone who likes crime dramas. I realize that Fox cancelled Lie to Me due to low ratings. I don't remember seeing ads for the show so I wonder if they promoted it well enough."}

This job is not as cut and dry and it sounds.  The group uncovers much during their investigation.

It seems to me that the 'writers' would and should make, at the very least, an attempt to get facts straight before portraying the beliefs of nearly 8 Million people.

When we eagerly waiting for the new season, we would rehash the past season, making possible plot's all our own, you know, really into it. Then when the announced date came and went, we researched, what went wrong. Found out it had been cancelled.  That was my first realization that TV had become like all other business, just that. Business. So disappointed with major networks. They had managed, with Kings, to create a possible alternate future of our world, that did not involve space ships or aliens or even magic. So, watch this series, and judge for yourself, if it wasn't an excellent addition to any network line-up."}

In contrast to Arrested Development, however, the characters are not very well developed, and so I'm watching it with far less empathy than those in AD.  The lack of social empathy is more like 30 rock where only a few characters are singled out for elaboration but they are so over-caricatured and ancillary that they are unrelatable as humans: in Ted this is the zany scientists and cold ceo and in 30 rock Jenna, Tracy, the paige and the writing staff."}

Dakota Fanning plays Lewellen, who loves Elvis Presley music and lives with her strict dad and God-obsessed grandmother, who ironically plays Carrie White's mom in the Stephen King classic. This movie makes you feel really uncomfortable regarding her dad getting struck by lightning and becoming dumb, and when she hears that someone has a ticket to see Elvis, she is forced to stip nude for him and dance and sing 'Hounddog' If you wanna see Dakota Fanning get raped, you'll love HOUNDDOG!!!"}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This is another of those indy films that is so good it is difficult to watch.  Fanning is a young girl on the verge of adolescence, who has that natural talent for singing that so many children lose.  She lives in a vivid rural milieu with a father who is a heavy drinker and an absent mother.  Her friends include a neighbor boy and a wonderfully lively group of southern blacks, whom she accompanies as an elvis singer.  It is warm and she is evidently going to become an extraordinary beauty.However, she is introduced to sex at too early an age.  This is not, as some reviewers have claimed, about early sexuality - there is nothing titillating about it whatsoever.  Indeed, completely unprepared, the theme of the story is that it nearly breaks her spirit.  It is about the possibility of healing and it is extremely, graphically realistic.  Fanning's performance was, in my opinion, oscar-worthy.Warmly recommended.  Just be prepared for stark realism."}

This guy has nailed every role he's had since 'BoB', he is great in my opinion. Regina King is also wonderful as the tough detective with a 'do nothing' partner played by Tom Everet Scott.

And why is the smart successful Jane still identifies with Deb, even though she does not possess Deb's body or mind any longer? Simple; because Deb was better looking.Again, an insult to any intelligent person who still believes that a good looking shallow woman without any apparent achievements is SUPERIOR to a smart, well-educated and successful woman.

Dark Blue is so far away from that, thats its easy to see why it didn't last. More of a vehicle for its star, the show drops the ball from the opening scene.

However, the actor probably made a great decision choosing this role as it moves him away from \"Spy Kids\"-typecasting.  That's like the Harry Potter dude doing \"Equus.\"  Once the annoying character is no longer present, the film really gets good.This film is about \"creating a monster,\" in Frankenstein fashion.

Who  would have thought that a show about crabbing would be a hit?  I like how the story lines are growing with new fleet vessels and thier crews, are a good mix  for future seasons. I  am glad they are  showing how crabbing works and how the  nuances  of that fishing  are impacted mininute by minute by nature above the ocean and  down on the floor.  I know that Discovery has trailer boats  so they are not alone  but I know they do work  hard to fil the quotas. Also I am glad that discovery are mixing in the USCG  and thier  presence in the fleet and on patrol. Very cool, glad the producers are thinking outside the box."}

A dumb doughnut eating cop (Joe Hansard) is investigating the whole thing.The film has high camp value. The dialouge is far better than the delivery. Initially the movie uses camera angles so you don't see the killer, but after a few kills they show the killer which most of us have figured out. In an effort to cover up the bad acting, worse special effects are used.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Campy Sexual situations. Watch at your own risk."}

Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress, investigate a UFO sighting, goes undercover as a Mafia boss, celebrates his Birthday, receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming, and finally solves the murder of his wife, Trudy. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON EIGHT!!!"}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I think the first season was better. The crimes/mysteries were more common place in that you see people lie all the time for the crimes depicted in season 1.  In season 2, the storyline gets more grittier, more dangerous for Dr. Lightman and his team as they confront liars who will do anything to cover up their lies. There's a hint of unrealism in season 2, only because civilians like LIghtman and his team hardly ever get called to go confront people in dangerous places such as Afghanistan or the site of a collapsed mine shaft where anything could blow up at any second. Psychologists like him and his team still realistically work under controlled conditions, either in their office or through videos and one-on-one interviews. Otherwise, though, season 2 is still exciting."}

{"label": 0, "raw": "The second story of \"Sons of Anarchy\" is highlighted by excellent acting on all accounts. There are no weak characters and only strong performances. The characters are interwoven in intriguing situations. The stories are not for the faint at heart: there are portrayals of rape, violence, and death.There is much tension arising from the stories. The problems increase and grab the viewer. One often does not know how situations can be resolved. A looming problem from season one is resolved over time, yet with much drama that nearly tears apart most of the characters. There are new white supremacist protagonists who are unsettling. A positive result is this makes the motorcycle criminals more appealing by comparison. These new villains create new conflicts from multiple angles which keeps the second season very interested. The friendships and defense of families among the criminal main characters allows viewers to root for them. One would probably want to familiarize oneself by viewing the first season before jumping into the second season."}

It crosses racial, i.e., socioeconomic, lines.  You keep asking \"Why is this? What is going on?\"  You ask yourself \"How could someone get to be this way?\"...then, you find out.  A part of you roots for the humanity of each of the characters.  You can sit back and just enjoy the story and the bit of a shock ending which becomes immediately logical.  The movie gives you some \"movie satisfaction\" when it is over."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "When this movie starts flipping between the present, and two different times in the past (which itself takes time to figure out), it is hard to follow. At first. Once the characters and their places in time become a bit clearer, the story evolves into a complicated tale of a search for love, understanding and acceptance (both by/from others and one's self). I found the story to be one that drew me in, and even when the ultimate direction became clear, kept me engaged until the end.Great cast too!"}
{"label": 0, "raw": "At first you wonder how the different story lines will tie together.  It is subtle and not shoved in your face, but with time the viewer sorts it out.

Jennifer Lawrence plays the main role as a teenager and Charlize Theron plays her as a grown woman.  There is a bit of a Capulet and Montague family feud going on, which is actually understandable in this case, which dooms the young romance."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "The maddening part of this movie (besides the gratuitous sling-shot killings of birds) is the fact that Mariana's mother is perfectly justified in having an affair, but Mariana is too immature to understand why.  And it's clear that her mother's lover adores her, and she him.  Ironically, the same physical deformity that turns off her husband causes her lover to care for her even more.  So the ensuing tragedy--the \"burning plain\" of the title--and Mariana's tragic life after that, are both avoidable.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it's a slow, meandering story that seems to be leading nowhere until it all comes together.  A worthwhile film. I only gave it 4 stars because the actors who played the younger versions of the main characters didn't much look like the adult version, and not that many years had passed."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Books and movies that are not predictable are my favorite. This movie took me awhile to catch on to the premise so I gave it a good rating.

At that point everything makes sense. I'm trying not to give anything away so details about the story won't be given here. I would suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys something different."}

It had neither portrayal and analysis of social and psychological issues new BSG offered - and even if you disliked it, you have to admit that new BSG was smart and stylish - nor any meaningful Sci-Fi or humor present in SG1/SGA.SGU was a sad sad long dragged out show with sad unlikeable characters, which even the abundance of the gratuitous sex scenes could not save.

Atlantis was exciting and fun and almost campy.  I could watch it while I did other things and still enjoy it.  SGU demands my attention and when I waste time just watching it it's not fun at all.  I'll try to keep going but if they don't get off that ship soon I'll have to quit.  I'm up to episode \"Life\" and so far overall the series sucks.

While there is a plot in each show, there is still the large plot that is &#34;where are we going, and why?&#34;.

The only real exception to that was the kid that solved the game he pretty much started out as a generally good guy that was always trying to look out for everyone's interest; I liked the final season much better as they started to turn this idea around and made everyone more concerned with the group and less concerned with themselfs."}

In episode 02 of lizard man a person will die and the actor who played a rescue man will have a wide smile on his face before/ right after proposing that the person is deceased. This season does have repeating monsters, but I think it was still all right. At times when we get to see the monster usually it's done too cheesy and the plot at times is also ridiculous. Like for example in the last episode, in total darkness, in total madness a guy who made hoax, told his friend to get separated to find another person and meet in 20 minutes. Seriously considering what was supposed to be happening no idiot would do that and no smart man alike. Would like to see season 3 and how different it is. No high hopes. The stories are still made out of some facts and lots of imagination."}

However, there are signs of fatigue among the show's writers:  Many episodes are downright depressing, characters have more or less all slept with each other, and many twists in the plot are difficult to believe.  For example, why would a doctor recommend a procedure that puts his patient at a major risk of dying?  Why would a hospital administrator allow a relative to get into a patient's room, in defiance of a judge's order, knowing that the relative will unplug the machine?  Can a surgeon in the middle of a procedure decide to stop and have his patient die because he just found out that the patient was the cause of an accident involving the surgeon's daughter? Have the writers never heard of lawyers? Have they no knowledge of the hippocratic oath? And, what's with the cat??!!"}

She is picking up counting and some of the songs, and it manages to keep her attention for almost 10 minutes at a time sometimes, which is huge for a 1-year-old.

It is shaping up to be the evil aliens (who really look awful instead of beautiful) against the good guys (FBI agent, priest, etc., as rebels).  The entire show this time advanced that premise rather than developing other aspects.  I wish the aliens weren't so unrelievedly beautiful on the surface and evil underneath too.  It doesn't leave much room for interesting stories other than good guys vs. bad guys.  The only thing I enjoyed this time was looking at the beautiful alien Anna and the neat way she could try on outfits virtually.  I doubt I will watch this next week.  I think I will stick with FlashForward and Fringe as my sci fi of choice this season.  Save your money."}

The agent works in the FBI's white-collar crime division in New York City and the master thief is there to provide a criminal's perspective to each case.  Catch is that the thief is confined to a two-mile radius by an ankle bracelet and needs to locate his missing girlfriend.  Tiffany Thiessen (of \"90210\" fame) stars as the agent's wife.

Certainly interesting stories about her early days in Hollywood, but not a lot about her personal life.  Only one of her children commented on Joan as a mother, and she was one of the twins adopted later than Christina and Christopher.  Did the abuse occur?  I think it did.

I'm not a Trek purist, but I just felt like the whole \"villain develops planet-destroying technology\" plot has been done a bit too much (e.g., Wrath of Khan, Generations, Insurrection, Nemesis) that the actual storyline seemed mundane.

Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) meets Kirk as an adult and recommends that he join the Starfleet.  This gives him the opportunity to meet Spock (Zachary Quinto) and all the familiar faces in the Star Trek fictional universe.The cast is top notch and their acting shows they have studied the history of the series.  Character essence flows well and gives great satisfaction - like comfort food for the soul.The action and story are fabulous - nothing too long or drawn out - just enough.  The movie is top notch."}

What do I mean?Each episode, for example, focuses on George going through a scientific-method-like process to figure out solutions to everyday problems. George's inquisitive nature helps him form hypotheses and experiment to test each hypothesis.George lives with a man with a yellow hat (that's his brand). His character's ok, but GEORGE steals the show. Kids will love the bright colors and uptempo pace of the show. The show has a narrator (who sounds a lot like the man in the yellow hat) who helps guide the viewer through George's actions and thoughts.You can't go wrong with this show."}

The Yellow hat character and others are charming and the show is overall respectful and informative add on shows great respect and forgiveness for George. We love the reality segments as well.

I really didn't want to see more of the same. This is very different, its about people, well one man, Christopher Foyle, and what happens in his life while he masterfully solves crimes. You can watch his process while he solves the current mystery (the UK, especially in the small villages, is rife with murder it seems) all the while trying to do his bit in the war effort.

When reading the original books, he is exactly what one envisions Poirot to be, making the films spring to life. And it doesn't hurt that the production company takes such care to make it a period piece, with housing, furnishings, costumes, manners, even idioms of speech, complete to the time frame.

{"label": 0, "raw": "I greatly admire Dame Agatha Christie and her wonderful work with the amateur detective genre but can take Poirot only in small doses. That being said, David Suchet and the wonderful actors in this series make it sparkle. I always think Suchet makes the obsessive-compulsive personality well-defined and am glad too that another wonderful actor Tony  Shaloub did the character in &#34;Monk&#34; that humanizes the condition. The realization that every person with such personality traits is not insufferable is nice. But Poirot's character really fits the period of the writing well and Suchet is brilliant. The episodes seem to me faithful to the stories and the era is captured with amazing detail in sets and wardrobe. It strikes me as a truly professional labor of love. I enjoy watching the series but this is a series where more than one episode at a sitting becomes cloying for me. I can appreciate it more in smaller doses."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This is the best made television out there. No American made show or series comes close. The dialogue, the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting, locations and cinematography and characters are top of the line. The staging is staggering in the first six seasons; the quality control falls off in some episodes later on. Perhaps because you get used to an exquisite product watching the first six seasons. Agatha Christie would be proud; maybe intimidated by the way her stories have been brought to life.  Every detail is spared no expense and continuity is unmatched. I can watch these over and over in spite of the fact that I know the ending and who the villain is. If you have never see a Poirot episode it&#8217;s well worth your time to watch. John Strickland is an excellent director and Suchet, and cast is top notch. With a cinematographer like Gavin Finney  casting by Susie Parriss, production design by  Jeff Tessler  and kudos to the entire production team, they are one of the best ever assembled."}

It's what fans have come to expect with Poirot, Agatha Christie, Masterpiece Mystery, and the untouchable as Hercule Poirot--David Suchet.The Blu-rays and new DVDs are newly remastered and restored to their original U.K. broadcast order.

This series must lead the pack in product placements. The view of Kellogg's, Ford, and many other product logos  was thrust into the viewer's face multiple times.  Did this technique make me want to run out and buy the product being pushed?  I think not. I quit watching commercial network television almost five years ago due to the number of commercials per segment, and the number of commercial segments per hour. Although there is really nothing I can do to avoid seeing the placements, I can let the manufacturer know that I find the ads leave me with a negative impression of that product by forcing the ad on me.

The acting talents of Ciar&aacute;n Hinds made this film special.  We are less impressed with Aidan Quinn, but perhaps that came from the sleazy character he played so well. How is it that we had not zeroed in on Hinds years ago?  His name was barely known to us before The Eclipse, and we are not sure how we failed to notice his portrayal of Dumbledore's brother in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

I especially loved the background piano music which created a kind of  mood of living as best you can with the knowledge that death is inevitable for all of us.  Aidan Quinn plays a boorish married suitor of Lena, the writer, and provides a counterbalance to the quiet, dignified Michael, who's just trying to raise his two children and look after his ailing, depressed father-in-law. The Irish town where this was filmed was quite lovely and added to the somber mood. It was a ghost story without all the usual cheap tricks.  I liked it."}

The children and families are of varying ethnic backgrounds...something most U.S. based shows lack altogether.  It is culturally sensitive and doesn't dwell upon children who have an 'abundance.'  It is creative, easy to understand and fun.  And absolutely no violence...quite true to Bill Cosby style.  I would recommend this to any child of any background anwhere!

At this stage of my young son's life, everything is a teacher...he is a sponge, soaking in all to which he is exposed.  No better teacher than the the &#34;real - life lessons&#34; offered in Little Bill.  The only difference that I note in Season 2 is that its somehow 'already familiar,' the episodes are all different but the novelty of being a first encounter has changed.

Sadly, I would have liked for Caesar to have said that famous line in the last episode of this season.The few reviewers who say there is &#34;no rating&#34; must have missed the TV-MA square by each episode.

It seemed like everyone was callous and brutal, and maybe that's the way Rome was, but after sitting through the first episode of this first season, I found myself not wanting to watch any more.I'm sure Rome will go on without me, and my best advice is to find a way to \"try before you buy\" and plunk down a lot of money to find it's not what you expected."}

It is a \"through the secret door\", trading places feature that further highlights what Jane Austen was trying to say about culture, high and low.  The switch between the two women (remaining nameless, no spoilers here) leads to a revised Pride and Prejudice holding delightful revelations about what customs mean and why they are important.

There are nice messages here and it's very age appropriate for younger children (my 4 and 2 year-old love this show).  There is no fighting and very little conflict, and it teaches children to work together towards a common goal.  The songs are catchy and will get stuck in your head, but it's a good change of pace from Dora."}

That being said, there are things in this movie that are more disgusting then the zombies being shot and people being eaten.  I am talking about people making lemonade and stirring the stuff with their hands.  I mean seriously, when you watch it and you will you will wonder the same thing.  It was actually more disturbing then the zombies eating people and zombies being shot.  It actually made me a little sick!  Regardless, good movie, decent acting, decent camera shots.

The animation is as strange and intriguing as the picture on the front, with realistic over-sized faces attached to inadequate bodies. The main character's deadpan acting adds a sublime sense of resignation to this futuristic view of life under corporate control. How interesting that this viewing coincides with the corporate destruction taking place off the coast of my state in the Gulf of Mexico. Seeing the power of a huge corporation first hand makes Metropia seem all the more possible."}

The world is running out of oil and the Trexx Corporation has connected all the undergrounds, or subways, together into a gigantic network.

Roger soon discovers that Trexx and a vast consumerist conspiracy control his life down to the smallest detail.  With the help of beautiful super model Nina (voiced by Juliet Lewis), Roger attempts to break free.  An unusual animation technique manipulates real photographs.

This app doesn't offer much - it is a clunky game that lacks finesse, especially in level and unit design.The most frustrating part is that the towers are slow. They fire a single shot, and then take forever to reload. And thats plenty of time for a herd of bubbles to go whizzing by. Not much of a defense. It takes a while to figure out that you need to build and upgrade power stations to recharge your towers so they can fire more than once. The instructions aren't too helpful, either. The touchscreen is also laggy at times, which adds to the frustration.It might be easier to just include a button that lets you wave a white flag and surrender, rather than wait patiently for inevitable annihilation.There are many better TD games out there. This one is mediocre, at best."}

The controls aren't perfect though. Placing the towers can be a little cumbersome in terms of fine tuning the location in a hurry. So meaning that after doing the initial click-to-place the &quot;dragging&quot; for fine tuning is very slow. ESC = 'back arrow'.Game plays just fine on my rooted / rom'd Charge."}

There are a dozen or more layouts and about 5 difficulty levels so lots of replay value although I feel the regular price a bit high, in other words I probably wouldn't have paid the price but it's definitely a good app as the free app of the day.

In my opinion, the 1-star reviews are unwarranted, and should be reserved for apps that really should be avoided.As for the permissions, this one really doesn't have any to speak of, so that's definitely a plus!Is it worth $3?

(C'mon guys- an ad is by definition obtrusive!)It has a simple, clean interface. The default for the \"Another\" button a new game at the same complexity level as the last one.It does not require network access in order to play.Best of all it runs on my Galaxy Tab 2 just as Amazon's compatability sidebar said it would. I have removed all the other sudoku games from my device, it's that good!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've played this game on the iphone for a couple of years and tried most of the variations offered on their store.  The choices on the android have been limited however I never found this one until Amazon offered it today. I snapped it right up to try so I could offer a quick review.This is a great app for working these puzzles with several options you can switch on or off. I highly recommend it if you like these kinds of puzzles.My iphone app could take a picture of a puzzle in the newspaper and convert it to a playable game. I'd love to try that with the superior camera I have now but this app can't do that.  So, I went with 4 stars."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have had the free version for over a year now.  I never bought it because one puzzle a day is plenty for me.  I think I tried every sudoku option out there on the market a couple of weeks ago because I was seeing if there was something better but didn't find anything that offers all the features this one does.  Although I will say sometimes the hint system doesn't explain the strategy as well as I would like (When it teaches you what to look for).Oh, and I just found out its compatible with my Xoom...excellent!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This Android game is the best, smoothest, quickest sudoku game engine I've ever used.  It is better than any I've used in a browser or as a download game on my computer.It includes 3 tutorial lessons, and then 13 different skill levels.It compares your times to those of many other players to show you how you're doing, statistically.You can use \"Hint\" > \"Check Entries\" at any time without penalty --it won't respond with \"Everything is just fine,\" until you've entered all of the essential pencil marks-- or else you can take advantage of their graduated hint system or automatic pencil marks.You can also enter the given digits of a printed puzzle in order to solve it within this game.You don't have to have Internet access at the time you are playing:  you can play while your phone is in \"airplane mode\"."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Definitely grab this today if you have any interest in a sudoku app. There's plenty of them around, some that are free. But this one is by far the best i've used. I can't say that it's worth $3 for everyone, as i'm not personally a hardcore sudoku guy. But really, the tutorials really make this worth it. The hard puzzles are actually challenging. Theres no shortage of puzzles. The highlighting system rocks, as well as the best hinting system i've seen..I need a lot of hints ^_^ so I very much appreciate the attention to detail there. The main menu doesn't look like anything special, but the actual board is clean and clear. Nice job, and definitely worth the money for people who love sudoku. Enjoy!Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "For playing sudoku, this is a good game - a nice variety of difficulty levels, and an unlimited supply of games (in practical terms, at least).For me where this shines is in the hints.  I've been playing Astraware Sudoku (on another platform) for years, and on the highest difficulty levels, always got to a point where I guessed which number an open pair represented with pencilmarks, backtracking if I picked the wrong number.  With Enjoy, I'm using the hints to learn how to use logic tricks instead of guesswork."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This was a free app of the day so I looked into it for my Kindle Fire. I enjoy word games, etc and this is a different way to use your brain to come up with words. I told my aunt about it and she loves Word Collapse as well.  Granted it is not the hardest or most challenging word game but it is most definately a different word game to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys word games and does not mind having one that is not difficult when you just need to play something to clear your mind."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "In this game you are given a grid of bubbles of various sizes which you must pop to clear the board. As each bubble is hit (with a satisfying POP!) it grows a size until finally it bursts, sending a blast to the nearest horizontal and vertical bubbles, which in turn causes them to grow. You are given a limited number hits, but as the bubbles burst they will do some of the popping for you.The trick is to figure out which bubbles to hit to cause a chain reaction of bubble popping splendor!A good time waster. You can solve bubble grid puzzles or play arcade mode to either get a high score or just to zone out on the pop pop popping.Minus one star simply because it can get dull doing nearly the same thing over and over, with no new challenges or rewards in higher levels."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've been trying to find out how to get in touch with the developer since I downloaded this app. It will record and save the conversation, but it WILL NOT PLAY BACK! I have even forwarded to myself in an email only to have an empty file arrive. I have done everything as instructed and verified that indeed there is a recording there that lists an amount of time, e.g. 3 minutes, 32 seconds, but it won't even start to play! How in the world do I get it to play back??"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "It works as well as it can on my device. it can be calibrated and it can display gridlines.  it will display the angle a well as the 'bubble' and can also display other units such a in/ft.  it displays full screen on my tablet.  my tablet is a viewsonic gtablet and has aknown issue where the accelerometer axes are not set up as they are in other devices so i can't set up calibration on two sides at once, but I cannot fault the app for that; I need to flash a custom rom. :)"}

{"label": 1, "raw": "So, I read the description and I'm psyched, right? Just what I'm looking for! Well, not quite.I always go through the reviews before installing. But I always download because I want to be ready to pounce. Even despite the reviews I was like, &quot;Huh, maybe it will still work.&quot;  My dissapointment set in when I went to install it and the permissions were far more reaching than the capabilities of not only the descriptions but the reviews.This app wants to read my messages? It wants to read my system log? Why? It wants unintrusive access to everything on my phone which, if it's replacing the Droid OS, I understand BUT when I look at the reviews and the full capabilities of the app it makes me extremely nervous. It's just this side of jailbreaking my phone as it is, no reason to invite trouble where it isn't needed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I don't understand why all the negative reviews. This is a very good home replacement app. I've used every alternative out there and while this is definitely not the best it's nowhere near the worst. Just because it's different and you don't know how to use it doesn't mean it's a bad app.  There's no way I'd pay anything for this app, not with GO being free and a much better option, but for free dxTop certainly deserves a download. My advice, ignore the bad reviews and try it yourself. It's free for f's sake!And to the reviewer below me, no, this app did not break your phone. If you believe that is even possible you need to immediately post your EVO on craigslist and go buy an iPhone."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I am using this on my rooted Captivate. It works extremely well. Very smooth and the widgets and look screen are a nice touch.Overall very impressed.I have tried many home replacements including but not limited too ADW ex, Launcher Pro, Go Launcher, Pandahome, Launcher 7, Mr. Home, Regina, aHome, etc ... Well... you should get the picture. All of the have some things that make them unique and none of them are perfect. dxTop pro isn't over the top with settings and customizations but it is unique and works very well.ADW ex is my favorite and go to launcher but dxTop Pro will definitely get it's use.Side note: Wake up Amazon! Allowing all of these stupid review is ruining your market. I can't imagine too many more developers are going to want to take a chance on faulty review scores because the stupid person downloading a FREE app didn't get the game they thought they deserved. Just another way we see how entitlements are ruining are society!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have been listening to scanners since they had crystals in them! Now they are trunked and newer scanners are expensive. Then I got a HTC Hero and this app and got the Scanner pro for free when they offered it. You can use it anywhere, anytime. I love both of them, free and pro and you can run them at the same time. If it is busy, it can by messy listening tho, :)But I love everything it does and hope it will do more. I would love to volunteer. Would love WSP too. A must have app for scanner lovers! Never had any problems with the actual app either, lots of work went into it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I never expected this scanner to be so great. I pick up police, fire, EMS, railroads.....from my area and from several different states as well. And the reception is super clear. I bought a scanner for a few hundred dollars last year and returned it - it was terrible. But this free app on my Kindle Fire picks up everything and all I have to do is type in a city name or county! Easy, fun and free. No trouble with installing it or using it at all.I highly recommend it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is amazing and FREE!! I could listen to this all night long. It picks up my local police station and you can't believe some of the stuff that goes on around town. The best time to listen to it is on weekends or holidays. It is very entertaining. Sometimes you just can't stop listening. Very addicting. There are complaints about it running down battery quickly, but I use this app on my kindle fire and it doesn't seem to use any more battery than any other open app. The other nice thing is that you can run this program in the background and still play other games or surf the Internet. I strongly urge you to give this app a try!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I live in a semi-rural county.  Wouldn't think much is going on around here, but with the suburbs on one end and farms on the other and several major roadways crossing the county, its busy.  And fascinating.  Enough for me to find the fire station numbers and listen for the sirens.  When nothing else is going on at home and I'm sitting horsing around on my computer, you can be sure that my phone is propped up next to me with this app running.  If I want to, I can choose many, many more local locations or big ones all around.  Still, for me its fun to listen locally."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really like this app!!! And..to top it off..it was free!!! The only thing I don't like about it is I have it on my Kindle Fire which I love..but it only stays on for so long then cuts off...then I have to reopen it..I wish it would stay on as long as I have it opened...would help a lot during bad weather!! For this I give Four (4) stars..if this problem can be fixed I'll be happy to give five (5) stars!!! If anyone knows how I can take care of this problem please please let me know..you can email me at ginaricec3@Yahoo.com.  Thanks!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this app. It allows me to know what the sirens I hear are all about. I can hear the local police, emergency and fire traffic. I have been able to hear of incidents happening in my own neighborhood which allows me to feel safer. I know what is going on and where the troubled spots are and when. When I hear of breaking national news I can look for a frequency in the area effected and can listen to events as they happen. I had an old style scanner when my children were teens and loved hearing the goings on. Now scanners have gone high tech and are available over your computer, Kindle, and even smartphones."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "First let's make one thing clear. The application has NO control over what channels are available. The people rating it 1 star need to read.The scanner itself works great. It uses an online provider to get its data, which receives its data from individual enthusiasts.It is great to use for killing the time or listening to local events. It may be a data hog but there isn't really an easy way around it from a code point of view. Nonetheless, this application is worth the increased data use. If you have a wifi connection of unlimited data like myself there really is no reason to avoid downloading this application."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I just wanted to see if it works and it does. I took it off because I don't know if it might be illegal in this state as most everything probably is here. Have no use for it anyway. It works and can be adjusted to many different areas at least where I am located. I didn't know so many people were jabbering on the radio so much. I heard Fire, Police and a lot of unidentifiable jabber talk going on even late in the night. An old Ham or CB operator that knew the lingo would enjoy this thing. A friend of mine works in the Fire Department so I will have to find out if I can have this without cops going goofy on me somehow for some reason. Might be useful in an emergency?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Well after reviewing at least ten different apps within two weeks I finally get to this. Hey everybody want to know what police and firefighters are up to? Then you need scanner radio free at the App store. This app works with the help of wi-fi the thing that most of the world depends on. If you want to know what is going on near you, you can search on the search selection and type in your state, country, city, or zip code and all you have to do is choose one out of the many options that pop up. This app has no lag and will keep you on alert so you know where the bad boys are. So what are you waiting for? The world to end. I don't think so. Its time to get this app because it has your name on it saying download me. Chill out and relax with scanner radio."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is a lot of fun on a cell phone but it's even more fun to watch on your GoogleTV!! A lot of times when I have people over I'll put this app on in the background and we'll just socialize or have some drinks and every once in a while we hear some action that we get into. It's really cool as well that you can search the world for a city's radio to listen to. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is beucase on the free version, there are certain featuers that are lacking. i.e. you can't use the &#34;play/pause/stop&#34; button at the top of the screen unless you pay for it but you can still hit the back button and do the same thing if you want it to stop. :)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Who would have thought this app existed.  It's ok I guess, it really just depends on where you live and what you are looking to hear on this app.  I would listen in to be nosy and see what kind of 'action' was going on around the city; sometimes I will check out NYC or Chicago or whatever...also, we had some wildfires close to town this summer and I would listen in on the fire dept. channel at times to see if I heard anything the news wasn't putting out.  Many times when the channels get busy they overlap and it's hard to understand.  I have downloaded this on my Kindle and on my Samsung Blaze...both worked fine.  Cheap entertainment app. :)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "For those that don't have a police scanner and like to make sure things are ok in your neighborhood this is the app for you. And hey its mobile and FREE!!!!  You just select your county and walah.....you have info for what's happening with the police, fire department,  and the EMT 's. And you will be the first to know of anyone you know is in trouble....going to jail,  being pulled over, accident,  and on and on. Enjoy it. Love You Love Nora"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "So this app doesn't really replace having a real police scanner, but its definitely entertaining to listen to. I like the GPS settings that find the broadcasts around you, and the alert function is kinda cool, if a set amount of people tune into a police band it will alert you, theory is if 100 people are listening at once something exciting is probably going on.  The feeds this app use are actually available to listen to for free online, but it is a cool user interface for your smart phone."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I enjoy listning to police/fire/rescue frequencies from time to time but don't care to shell out for an actual factual scanner . Thought this would be an enjoyable option , which it was but alas my immediate region is not available to listen in on and lets face it , who wants to NOT hear whats going on in their neck of the woods ? I did enjoy listening in on some of the international frequencies it offered , Sydney Australia is a great one ! So for that alone it was worth it but don't be surprised if your preffered area isn't available since many of the places across the US weren't offered for listening ."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I wanted an ap like this to listen to when I don't have access to my scanner, but this won't work because it doesn't offer any of the frequencies that I like to monitor. I only offers a selective group of frequencies, and they are not in my city! It's OK for what it is, and might be fun to listen to is you want to learn some of the radio codes used by law enforcement, but it doesnt replace a real scanner that can be programmed to your liking."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I am a weather head and like to check scanners where there has been a major weather related event.  This app is working just right for that.  I don't monitor local scanners for all police and emergency activity on a regular basis so I can't speak to that but I think it would be quite suitable.  Update - due to a large event in my area last weekend, I used the local scanner feeds and it was excellent - easy to locate what I wanted and switch between the main police and EMS feeds!  Audio was great, taking into account that scanner audio can be difficult.  Handy pop up of codes, too."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I originally had a Sony E-Reader, so Kindle was not an option but now I have a Lenovo K1 Ideapad and the app is available. While the Kindle app does have some good settings like highlighting a word to get the definition, font size and text, easy sync and great night mode. The formatting leaves a lot to be desired. Bundle books become one long book and all the books I have read have yet to have an option of jumping or returning to a page or chapter. Which come to think of it I have not actually read a book with page numbers, just percent of how much of the book has been read. The free books and having them linked to my Amazon account are a plus but the formatting takes this app from great to just okay."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have used this app on both desktop and android and would rate it as &#34;functional, but nothing to write home about. Had to remove it from my phone, but that was because of RAM problems, not the app itself. It does have a few cool &#34;sister&#34; apps that are separate apps working in conjunction w/ it, but the app itself is about what you would expect. May very well work better on the Kindle hardware, but I don't see the point in purchasing a tablet when I have a smart phone, a laptop, and 2 desktops already. I personally prefer Adobe Digital Editions and the Nook apps (Barnes & Noble), but mostly just because I am more familiar, having used them both first, and I actually would rather have a paper book than any of them. If you need a decent reader app, this one is just as good as the next, so go ahead and try it out, just make sure to comparison shop."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As someone who used to own a kindle, this app falls far behind my expectations. The ability to read books, change font size, turn pages quickly is fine. It's the organization, or lack there of, that drives me crazy. I have no idea which books I've read, which ones I've not read. I can't put them into folders or categories like I could on my kindle. It would be nice to file books I've finished into a separate folder, or if there was a way to  tell which books I've read or not in the list of books. That's really irritating. My kindle fire it told me which books I've opened, and which ones were new. This app doesn't do that. I read at least 5 books a week and need a way to organize them, this app falls short."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I keep updating hoping to find some of what I think is essential for reading an ebook, but Kindle doesn't have what I need yet.I want to be able to choose my own font.  I find it very difficult to read in a serif font, but I can't change it.I want to be able to choose left justification.  If you need a large font full justification leaves too much space between words especially if you read on a small device.I want to be able to choose my font size.  The difference in sizes really jumps too much.  If I could choose the font size by number it would really help.Without even these basics, I don't find it very useful."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Used to I had to cart 5 or 6 books with me on trips and if I really liked them I had to bring them back with me. With this Kindle for Android app I can have as many books as I want, read them all and buy more. I love books, but this is so space friendly! I no longer need to worry about space, weight, or running out of books. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I often find typos; sometimes reversals, or combining groups of words, missing words, but you can still read and understand the stories."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a OK app.  I mean it doesn't do that much.  It surely doesn't have all the features a Kindle reader has.  One day they will upgrade it more so it has more features but in reality Amazon wants you to buy a real Kindle, and not use an app.  Well I did and I gave the real Kindle away.  I got a Samsung Note 2 and that is all I need along with this app.  I am not going to run around with several different devices and the Note 2 does everything and does it well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I didn't expect much and was very pleased with this. Many free books by big-name authors available,  with as many as 75 new ones a day (some days 0, 1, 2 etc.) sometimes there is plenty to read,  free or to buy at good prices. Works well, although mine on a DROIDX run sometimes shuts down for no apparent reason. Only capable of using kindle files. Overall, probably my most used program. NOT AS GOOD AS AN ACTUAL KINDLE ! YOU CAN'T DO VIDEO BOOKS, ETC. Limitations. They won't make it much better as they want you to buy a kindle."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "i originally downloaded this from Android Marketplace. I loved the ease of reading e books with this app so much that I got a Kindle as well for the extra features. It gives me the best of everything. I am never without a book now but have no more piles of books all over. The sync between Android &amp; Kindle works flawlessly for me. Books can be archived online so I can go back &amp; read again. This is great for me because I love series fiction and sometimes forget things before the next book comes out. There is some content you can't get with the app you can with Kindle. I think maybe Amazon wants to keep a few things out of the app so people still buy Kindles. Something else that makes having both worthwhile is that Kindle is totally non glare so you can read outside but not backlit (which is easier on the eyes) while my phone has backlight so I can read in dark/dim light."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This great app gives me access to all of my Kindle books when I am unexpectedly delayed at an appointment. This installed and runs without issues on my HTC EVO (Android v2.3.3).This has a lot of nice features like full color book covers, able to indicate and jump to the last location read in a book in progress (as long as your Kindle wireless was on), and ability to access the Amazon Kindle Store. It doesn't have the text-to-speech, but that is a minor consideration.I still prefer to read on myKindle, Wi-Fi, 6\" E Ink Pearl Display, but this is great back-up since I almost always have my phone with me.Highly Recommended!CFH"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Kindle offers the convenience needed to read book. First of all imagine you had to carry you best 10 books on you or with you everywhere you went.. It would far better having just the words in these books without the paper used to put the ink on it. Kindle makes reading books a comfortable experience and you can then exercise your arm and hand muscles in a gym instead of carrying a heavy book bag. In conclusion, use kindle you stone age mammal.

All of my books easily sync to each device and the eBooks are always sitting quietly in my library patiently waiting their turn to be read.  I love the fact that every single book, no matter what device I read them on, can be read off-line. The number of free and for purchase books is never ending. The Android app. is just as user friendly as an actual Kindle. Step 1: Set up an account. Step 2: Choose a book. Step 3: Read.  Oh, get this...when you call Amazon with a Kindle question - you get a real live person, who actually helps. Get this app!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "We love our Kindles, but having the option to continue reading our current books on other devices is just too cool.  It picks up where you left off as long as the WiFi is on regardless of what device you are on.  We use it on our Kinles of course, our smart phones, and now our ePads.  The vendor of the ePad said Kindle would not work without a difficult download of an older version of the app; then an update by replacing it with a new app.  None of that was required.  I just downloaded the Kindle app for Android and it works right out the shoot.  It even does somethings better than the Kindle itself.  The battery is much better on the Kindle, but having the ePad option just makes it even better."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love using this app. It's become my very own personal best friend in the past months. There are drawbacks I don't like. Number one being that there are no page numbers and sometimes there is no way to navigate chapters. If you lose your place at times you have to flip through and hope to find it again or trial and error. There needs to be a page location that is not just 374 out of 1000, which doesn't reflect the page number. The other thing I don't like is that you can't organize your books. There is no way to make a book playlist by author or by name. I wanted to separate the same author books into the proper series to read by and it won't let me at all, which is frustrating. Other than that though, it is a good app and swiftly allows downloads of new items. Also multiple book bundles get a little wonky when trying to find another book within the bundle to read."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Kindle for AndroidIf you have a Kindle account and an Android device you need this app. Without it I couldn't read my ebooks on my Android. I have found that in using an Android tablet, in my case it's a Pandigital SuperNova, you should have your Amazon Kindle archive account listed as a favorite in your browser. This way you can go to your book list and simply tell it to download to which device you are using.As with most anything you get or do with Amazon you can't go wrong. It's all good."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "NO Password Protection - One Click Always ON!! I email Amazon and they replied \"at this time, the password feature is not available on Kindle app for Android\". That is a terrible way to do business. It is very shady to try to get people to constantly buy things buy accident. They demand card information and then offer no protection once the app is on you phone or tablet. Anyone (including my children just trying to read their chapter book for school) could buy books accidentally. What a shady business strategy! I am VERY disappointed in you Amazon. I expected better from you. This is shameful exploitation of loyal customers."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "in the last round of updates on my android amazon removed the feature allowing me to load my own books into the app via the sdcard. now the only way to get them in is to have a &quot;send-to-kindle&quot; email address wich u can ONLY get if u own a kindle (wich i dont). a very poor decision wich makes this app worthless to me. Installed nook and converted my books to epub with calibre. Apparantly Barnes &amp; Noble want people to use their app. nook color looking more appealing than a kindle right now. /sigh..... i really liked the kindle app to. sad day for me"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I had enjoyed this app for my phone and then a few days ago it was unfunctional for some reason. I erased it and installed a newer version and it's fine again. I was a bit concerned as I had read from several reviewers that it didn't work on &#34;older&#34; androids. It is fine for my Samsung Galaxy 3. I enjoy the ability of reading in my fire at  home and yet have the ability to read when I'm out and have some free time. It sync's wonderfully and I'm very pleased with it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I never planned on buying e-books, I was more than happy just using a print book. That just changed, I received an Android tablet (10.7 inch) for my birthday in January, and didn't do much with it until recently. I was in Amazon App store to download a timer for poker when I came across the Kindle app. So I downloaded that as well, while looking to order a new book from one of my favorite authors, I noticed that he had written several short stories for the Kindle only. I ordered the stories, and was delighted with the ease of operation in downloading to the tablet, the ease in reading while in bed, on the couch, room lights on or off. I am definitely a believer in e-books now. I still like print books for the beach and pool, but the Kindle is great for the other times that weather is not an issue for electronics. Definitely recommend this to all the readers out there."}

I was also using a Kindle Bible in church to quickly jump to the  'Table of Contents' then to the chapter (Book) I wanted. After this last update there is no '2 touch' go to contents any more. In fact the \"Table of Contents\" in the menu will not even take you to a  'Table of Contents'. To change books in the Bible I have to:1. go to the menu2. choose Navigation3. from there I can choose  'Table of Contents'4. choose book5 choose chapterBy then it is too late.

Doesn't come up often, but I've kind of wished I had it available a couple of times.  That's the only drawback I see.It is very easy to navigate, and easy to put items on or take item off your device.  Actually, it's easier than with my old Kindle!  Easy to download your books from the cloud.  Easy, easy, easy!Love it!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The GUI on this isn't the best, but it is pretty straightforward nonetheless. The only thing I would like to see added to this app is a way to do a one-touch download of all books purchased. I scanned through and ordered about 50 books from my computer, thinking they would automatically get sent to my tablet, but they didn't. The covers do, but then you hav eto go through one by one to download the books themselves. I'd rate 5 stars if not for this."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "I have tried almost every sync app out there for android.  My criteria are that it must sync ratings both ways, work with smart play lists in iTunes, sync play counts, and be user friendly.  I found nothing else even close to this app.  I use the WiFi sync add-on with this. I once had a problem with a non US phone, and the developers fixed the problem immediately.  Very responsive.  Bought it here in Amazon because the other market doesn't work when I travel...  No complaints after almost 1 year."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is one of the best apps I've purchased through the years. With my new phone, Galaxy Note 2, for some reason I wasn't able to get all my music onto the phone. Many songs would be missing, and it would take forever to transfer the music. I tried several times and finally decided to see if there was a good app out there as I was becoming frustrated.I found iSynr, which I've heard of in the past but didn't feel the need to have. I decided to try it, I use iTunes anyway on my computer. It was amazing! It was fast, transferred all my songs and cover art, and on top of that all my playlists.This is by far one of the best apps I've purchased through the years and well worth the cost. For smooth syncing and music control from computer to phone and back again don't fear wasting your money on this app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I must admit to HIGH frustration when I first download it and couldn't get it to transfer playlists -- only the songs -- which would have made it useless because you can transfer songs for free without an app with just a USB.  Even restored Kindle to new condition and tried again. Customer service was prompt in responding and suggested I download their (free) music player and use that one instead of Amazon's.  Worked like a charm and now this is JUST what I needed.  Maybe I missed it, but never saw that piece of advice in my installation instructions, so I would recommend they add that so people like me don't get confused (I'm pretty tech savvy too, so if I didn't get it, I'm sure others would benefit from that bit of info!).  Still I'm happy enough to go from 1 star to FIVE stars.  They got it right!"}

I actually hope it does, for likeTuneIn Radio Prothere are a lot of local stations that I do not have access to, so for the momentiHeartRadiois the only one that I can listen to all local, and even some elsewhere that is ineligible for me onXiiaLive Proor TuneIn.The interface is a breeze to get through and to get used to. You can search songs, you can favorite songs; you can even tag songs, which is something that I haven't seen before. Overall, the app alone is pretty good. I just hope it gets improved by making more stations readily available."}

I selected one and BAM (Like the Chef!) Japanese music started to play like I was there on the Island of Fukuoka in the city of Saga.  I wonder what they were saying during the commercials?  I highly recommend this program."}

Huge choice of streaming music from every genre from around the world. Since it was one of my new experiences in the e-music or streaming music, I'm hooked. Get this app, YES, recommended. ."}

As a Baby Boomer, I can't stand current music and only listen to the music I grew up with. I love the station selection on XiiaLive Pro. It works great on Kindle Fire.  My fave station is Fun 45's.com. If you were born in the 50's,  you'll love it too. Well worth the price.  No adds, no commercials, no problems at all, just great music."}

It is also easy to switch from station!  It is easy to use and you can leave it turned on while you switch to reading a book or a magazine.  This offers every type of music from classical to country.  There is nothing about this app that I did not like.This is one of my favorite apps."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Not a very bad app, but not the best. I recommend TuneIn app which has better function to find local stations, (the TuneIn app made this easy). This app did not have as comprehensive catagory functions. Display of radio stations did not always display the station's logo, which makes quick selection more of a chllenge. I did not pay for this app, I got it with the free app of the day from Amazon, I would not pay for it, there are better apps such as TuneIn to go with."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "App and reviews sounded great, esp. for free, but it never worked for me.  I downloaded it twice, uninstalling in between and rebooting phone, and still kept getting the weird 'ball bouncing on hard floor' sound and 'Android Media console died' message no matter what radio station I tried.  I got one to stream for a few seconds but it kept losing the connection and going on and off.  I'm on Verizon 4G with a very strong signal. so it's just an app that won't work for me."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is another solid internet radio app with a gorgeous interface. My favorite radio apps are iHeart and Tunein for local radio. Xiialive has a wider variety of radio stations not found on either iHeart or Tunein. I searched for some of my favorite local stations I use in the other 2 apps and they are not available in xiialive.So instead of using xiialive to replace the other 2 which is what I had hoped it looks like it will compliment the other two apps.UPDATE: This is the FASTEST radio internet app I have used. I don't know how the devs did it but unlike the other internet radio apps you usually have to deal with the connection first then the buffering of the audio. With xiialive I have NOT encountered any buffering or connection issues. Playback is nearly instantaneous. I tried it from a range of radio stations from around the world including different genres and as soon as I selected the station the audio appeared."}

This app is particularly well built and functions rather well. It's got a great UI and it's easy to understand. There's plenty of stations to listen to. Found local and international stations I'm already a fan of. All that said this app simply doesn't bring anything to the table that I don't already have the ability to do and doesn't pack enough to replace any of the apps I have. I'd recommend any of the 4 aforementioned apps before recommending this one but this is one solid app in it's own right. 4 stars!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Very enjoyable app.  Have listened to it for a few months before giving it a review.  As the days have progressed, it has gradually replaced my shortwave and hd radios with more stations to choose from and no need to play the antenna dance.Works great on the k-fire original.  Can run all day if the battery is fully charged.  I find new, enjoyable, unexpected stations almost every day.  Good sound.The only problem occurs when I fastforward too quickly through my list of saved stations.  The programme freezes.  Just restart your device and remember to wait until the station is fully buffered before moving to another channel and you'll be back to business as usual.Well worth the purchase price.  Give it a try."}

There are several animated options as well, including a HYPNOTIZING SPIRAL.I keep hoping for a rave, so I can whip this out and be like ubercool.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I played all the levels and didn't find that there was any bias to the computer rolling more doubles than myself....also, I only consider myself to be a slightly above average player and find it rather easy to beat the computer at level 5.  So either I'm a better player than I think I am or the game's AI  could stand a little improvement. That said, the game is an enjoyable time killer and seems to work flawlessly without any bugs or glitches.  The operation and animation is smooth and the controls are quite easy to use on even the smallest screened smartphone.  I'll be keeping this one in my game apps....at least until I find something better."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I miss playing backgammon and this is a nice way to be able to play when I can't find a partner.  I enjoy playing and winning, so I just use the easier levels.  Occasionally the CPU will get some strange runs of doubles but looking at the stats shows that it is not that bad.  For people really wanting a challenge, I would suggest using a high difficultly level.  It makes some pretty stupid moves, like moving pieces in the home area to a better take off position while there are still pieces outside of the home area.  But maybe the harder difficultly level corrects that."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Unlike many games, the ads on this one do not bother me and I do not find them intrusive. This free version of backgammon is easy to play, but still challenging. It seems as if the computer \"learns\" from my moves; at least this is how I see it and it makes the game more challenging.  I have it on my phone and Kindle Fire. Many games look too small on a cell phone, making them difficult to play, but this one is not so it makes a good diversion while waiting in line or when I am sitting around, waiting at places such as an auto repair shop or doctor's office."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is an excellent version of backgammon.  Very easy to play or undo your moves.  Although, sometimes it really looks like the CPU is cheating, I do not believe it does.  I have beat this game so many more times than I have lost and I have played at level 4, a lot.  Plus, I have played many other backgammon computer games &amp; none compare to this one.  The higher the level the more the CPU uses classic strategy moves and it also hits your piece more, but that goes with any good board game.  All things considered this is a worth while game to down load and purchase."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Despite AI's claim to the contrary, this program cheats.  I've had this one day, played maybe 10 games, and every time I've put it on the bar it gets out on the first roll.  One game it got out three times in a row when I had four covered.  And it wasn't the same spot open every time.  The 6/1, 3/1, 4/2 rolls to start the game for them and the 6/2, 6/3 rolls for me are quite regular, too.  And guess how often those open pips get hit....  Prepare to be frustrated, like with every other computer version you've played.  At least it was free."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I just loaded the checkers app by this developer and loved it so went looking for more apps by them and found backgammon.  Years ago I used to play daily and entered public tournaments (we were not elite players - just players who were obsessed with backgammon).  However I have not played a lot recently and am not familiar with all the online games or other apps.  I played the app at the most difficult setting and found it worked well and was fun to play.  The app works like a full tablet sized app on my ASUS Transformer tablet.  This app looks good (not as richly colored as checkers but still nice), the pieces move smoothly (no lagging), and the board lights potential moves.  Nice app in my opinion!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "One of the best free apps out there. There are enough customizable options to make everyone happy. You have to work at it to lose on easy. On the hardest level, a win is a victory and the dice always roll in favor of the computer.  It is great that it has a 2 player option that you can use to pass it back and forth for live play. Best of all, it has a great interface that doesn't make you work hard to figure out how to play the darn thing!  The graphics are nice as well.  The free version is ad supported but they the ads aren't annoying and don't interfere with game play."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire and I love it. The graphics are great plus you have options for difficulty, number of rounds in a match and it keeps track of your stats as well.  It also can show you possible moves if you are a beginner.  The game pieces are large enough that it's easy to see and use. Nicely done! As usual with free aps, there is advertisement but it is totally off to one corner and does not interfere with game play. Once in a while there is an offer to download one of their other games, but it is rare and again not a problem."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I found only two backgammon games in the Amazon app search, and the reason why is that the folks  @ AI Factory have written a solid game for those of us that remember the reason for these once popular games before FPS and D&amp;D. Real staticical stradederies. (as Geo. Bush would say). The game lets you concentrate on why certain moves are better than others and undo when you go astray and the algorithm smacks you down.On the next update I would and a line that says &quot;Not resigning&quot; when the game score is tied and the next game decides the match, even though its looking bad!  ie, a continue play button for fun's sake.  Compact app, plays great on my Kindle Fire.  MLawson di Ransom Canyon Rock Solid Consulting."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like this game but as difficulty is increased so is the probability that dice roles will benefit the AI.  Difficulty is increased by the computer's ability to get the exact roll that will capture any open game piece.  Your rolls,  on the other hand, are increasingly likely to force leaving a piece open to deny your ability to cover spaces.  I'm sure that programming an AI to &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; is difficult but manipulating the dice roll as a solution is infuriating.  Also, as a general rule, if the AI asks to double, resign the game. I play the game frequently but more often than not (on the higher levels least) I will quit the game out of frustration."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The game itself is a little to easy.It's a quick easy time killer for when you don't have alot of time to kill, but you don't want to stare at the walls for 5 or 10 minutes.

{"label": 1, "raw": "If you enjoy playing Backgammon, I recommend downloading this one, it can keep you entertained for hours on end.  I particularly like being able to choose the difficulty levels.  I don't really understand the &#34;doubling&#34; option that pops up from time to time, but you can turn that part off and not be bothered with it.  The computer is a good opponent even though some of its' moves don't always seem logical, it does give you a run for your money so to speak, and it plays fair.  The only improvement I would make on this game is to also offer the option of playing Acey-Duecy, but for the time-being I'm content with Backgammon."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I am not a very serious backgammon player, so I cannot speak to the quality of the AI. I do know that it can beat me on level 5 if I play irresponsibly. Of course, sometimes I get lucky. I do know enough about backgammon to know that \"luck\" usually favors the better player. Yes, the dice matter, but it is more about what you do with the rolls you get.I find it fascinating to read accusations that the game \"cheats.\" I just played a game where I was way behind and rolled consecutive double 6s to get closer. I still lost, but I thought I would throw out this experience as evidence that the dice can come up with unusual rolls both ways.You just can't go too far wrong with the AI Factory games. I love their backgammon, checkers, and chess. I was thinking about buying this anyway, so I was very glad to get it as the FAOTD."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This review is for the free version.  Very nicely done implementation of backgammon, with fast and elegant interface, nice user controls, and good documentation.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the computer opponent seems to follow a flawed strategy with its end game in that it doesn't try to get its pieces off the board as soon as possible.  Also it seems slow to double when the game is winning and quick to accept doubles when I'm winning.  All in all, it's just challenging enough for me to make it interesting at level 5.As for the random dice generator, I don't agree that the computer cheats, but it doesn't seem to have a true uniform distribution (where each of the six sides of each die is equally likely).  In one of my first dozen games it gave me the same roll three turns in a row, and it does seem to roll an awful lot of doubles."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The AI has some serious strategy problems.  In the last game I played, it had all its remaining pieced on 1 and 2, and rolled double ones.  It should have removed 4 from the board, but instead moved 4 from the 2 position, to the 1 position.  Stupid.  Making up for this deficiency, the computer gets better rolls.  It doesn't get more doubles, but it gets higher totals, and usually gets exactly what it needs.  Still fun, but still flawed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm thrilled to have a backgammon game to play that requires no human partner. Aside from the fact that I don't even know anyone who wants to play the game, the invisible computer is way faster than a human. And, the AI opponent doesn't get its circuits in a bunch if you put them on the bar repeatedly. The moves available light up, and that sure makes things easy on the eyes. Since I haven't played in a while, this is a great way to get reacquainted with the game and start working my way up the difficulty levels. Lots of fun to play for 5 minutes or an hour!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I picked this up a few days ago as another FAOTD (thank you, again, Amazon!).  I've always wanted to learn to play Backgammon, and though this app isn't really designed to &#34;teach&#34; it, it makes it very easy to learn.  The graphics are good, and the game play is quick.  There are several options that can affect the duration of a &#34;match.&#34;  You can have a quick one-game match, or you can play to 15 points, requiring several &#34;games.&#34;  After playing this, I'm ready to buy my first real Backgammon set (from Amazon, of course!)."}

Nock his piece onto the bar, every time he rolls the exact number he needs to knock any of your uncovered pieces onto the bar in return. Undo to see if there is a way to cover... nope.

Or better yet, try getting out of the labyrinth while keeping your sanity. Maybe you should take the game's advice - or wait, don't because usually it doesn't work. What's worse is that it actually retorts when you finally tell it to **** off. Strange, difficult, and taunts the player. Decide for yourself if its your thing or not."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "If this app were free, I'd probably give it 3, maybe 4 stars if it supported Android 3.0.  For $3?  It's lucky to get even 1.They seem to have left out a number of places, like IHOP (they have Denny's, though), Taco Johns, Papa Murphy's and Golden Corral (though they have Old Country Buffet).It also just displays nutritional info, but it lacks the ability to put together a whole meal and get a total of all those numbers.There are free apps that do a much better job of calorie counting than this one."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm assuming this application is a work in progress, as there are currently an odd mix of restaurants. The major places are covered of course, along with some various other places I'm not familiar with. If the dev continues to add to this list, it could prove to be a very extensive resource!The ability to sort by macronutrient or name is very cool. Good idea.The inclusion of some of the chain restaurants that aren't fast food would be very nice. I see applebees is there so it looks to be in the works.A utility in the program to request restaurants to add or even reference sources such as a url or something to make it easier for the dev to find and add more places would be icing on the cake.Cool application. I hope to see it grow.  For the health conscious out there, it's a no brainer on this free day!  (Thanks Amazon!)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "It does give you calories (and four other facts) for the items you'll find on the menu but it only gives you four and you can't put it all together.  For instance, if you look at Chipotle on the app, you can see the beans and the rice and everything's nutritional facts but unless you're writing it all down and adding it all up, you have no general idea of the nutritional facts of the burrito you're about to eat.  And by \"nutritional facts\" I mean fat, protein, calories, fiber, and carbs since that's all they give you.  Glad I didn't pay for it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "First you're restricted to the restaurants it has listed (no Red Robin for example). If you do choose from the list you don't get to choose sizes. If you happen to get the only size, it still doesn't count for you, it's just a lookup.Ultimately that's what this app is, a simple online menu lookup for some restaurants with only one size and no descriptions.There is a search feature, but really it's just a filter, you can't search across menus for instance.The first free app of the day where I'm sad that even though it was free to me Amazon is paying the dev 1/5th list price. Sorry Amazon."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was hoping for more to come of this app as the idea of an app that can help you add up the caloric intake is a great idea, but this app could use some extra work.  I'm glad I picked this up for free and didn't pay the $2 for it.  I'll still keep it, and probably refer to it, but the interface is not all that great to work around and I really wish it would allow you to look at several food items at once so you can see everything.I do appreciate that it is more than calories, knowing how much fat, protein, carbs, and fiber is also useful.I hope they update this app, I would like to see it become more than it is."}

I like the features of being able to move an item places in case you tap the wrong field.

I am just a user who appreciates a good puzzle game... unless the developers are too lazy to make their app compatible with popular devices! shame on you concrete! 0 stars if I could! come back when you learn to work out apps for all droid devices, especially the most popular ones!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have the parking lot game,different development team, that would play on my phone and tablet. Unforantly the graphics were poor on the ten inch screen. The author of this game did a great job on improving the graphics in this version.  Ironically my phone is a Droid Razr so per the developer's comments, I can only play this on my tablet and play the other version on my phone. Overall it is great game regardless of the eye candy and I highly recommend it for all ages. (Toshiba Thrive 3.2.1)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a very fun way to waist (spend) time. As far as all the worry about datamining? If your playing on a Kindle Fire, as I am what data can they get? Also if your worried just disable Internet access before starting the game.  Believe me, it is well worth any small effort just to play this game.  To all you yelling about this being a copy of other games like Blockme,,, almost every game is a copy of the one that came before it.  It's called innovation or improvement.  Paranoia is sometimes a good thing but this is just a game and an easy workaround for any phone users.  I would readily put this as one of the most brain teasing and fun games on Amazon.  jmho"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Although I got this free on Amazons Free App of the Day, I would gladly pay the buck for this many puzzles! The game is certainly fun &amp; addicting, no bones about it.I especially appreciated its thorough game settings &amp; instructions on how to play in the Menu. Many game apps lack this, making it difficult to play them.For those asking why &quot;the permissions&quot;? It's for sharing of your high scores online,  IF you chose to do so.If you like strategy type game puzzles then, I recommend giving this one a try."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is an almost perfect preschooler game. The screens are high definition, colorful and the animation is well done. The point of the game is to complete a set of three challenges in order to be rewarded with the child's choice of a sticker. Then repeat. The challenges range from counting to matching colors or fruits to a simple puzzle to memory games. They rotate randomly. All the while a cute little monkey dances on the screen when your child is successful.It is easy enough for my 2yr old and captivating enough for my 5yr old. It works well on all my devices from Thunderbolt to Galaxy Tab to Bionic.Well worth the cost."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This program consists of about six single-screen puzzles, each with a few variations.  After about 10 minutes of play they begin to repeat.  As you move through the games there is no escalation in difficulty or any apparent attempt to select the \"next\" puzzle based on previous puzzles or the child's success at solving them.In our case my 4-year old daughter got bored even before the first sequence was completed.  A little ways after the puzzles began to repeat she closed the app and wanted to watch a movie.On the plus side, this app is \"solid\" (no bugs and with a finished appearance).  It also does *not* need any kind of Internet connection to run.  (Some reviewers said it did and I expect they may have been using an earlier version.)  Finally, it runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.In summary, it is good for at least one fairly short sitting."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app works fine. I gave it four stars because there is no option to work on one kind of game at a time.To all the teenagers that rated the app one star because they are mad it is a kids game, get a life.  You need to rate apps based on their quality in that category and for giving the user what it said it would. This is for adults to entertain their children with. And I really wish everyone would stop whining about amazon, it is old, this isn't a forum for you to bit.. about amazon and what free app they are giving you, it is a place to rate said app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this app when it was free, but it is definitely worth the $2 asking price. Interface is pretty solid, colors are bright, voices are annoying; all the things that hold a child's attention. I feel this does a good job of teaching simple shapes, colors, and counting.Basically this is a collection of mini games for your little one. Every few mini games, it rewards you with a sticker, which you paste on a wall and immediately go back to mini games. Shape puzzles are smooth and easy for my three year old, counting is maybe a little automated as it doesn't encourage you to follow along as it counts when you tap the fruits. It is educational until your little angel can count to 20 on his or her own, but even then it's entertaining and anything that buys me an extra ten minutes of peace at the grocery store check-out is worth two bucks!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "My older daughter loves this game.  I don't know what draws her to it, if it's the graphics or the sounds, but she did learn how to match objects for other games I got later based on this one.  At 2 years old, this game drove her to figure out how to understand matching fruit and with other games she never really cared.  I don't like the short 10-second recycled music song that constantly plays (it's not annoying, just too short), but the animation works well and it has a lot of variety.  Great job on the developer part for getting this \"formula\" right."}

I walked onto my parents room and my grandfathers ashes are in that little golden container thingy that they get put in and I put on the radar and it just about went crazy. and it said grandpa on the screen. so I ran out of the room creeped out, like a lot.another time it said Texas on the screen, this is stupid but Texas was thr answer to a game I was playing later.I wouldn't say I'm totally convinced, but its more like 50/50"}

Plus I was in a room at night with my friends and it said &quot;visitor&quot; so we got scared and went into the kitchen and my friend was messing around with a bucket then it said &quot;bucket&quot; which also creeper me out but I think it's worth it and pretty fun but at night it can definitely give you a scare."}

I continued down the stairs to get my ferret. her name is snickers. I Used to have a ferret named giggles. she died in her cage. but when I was by her cage the words &quot; giggles, owner, friend, and cage &quot; SHowed up but there was only one dot right where I found here. a very cruel coincident I would say."}

I do believe in ghost but i'll have to do a little more researching to see if this is really a reliable ghost detector. all in all it is an interesting app."}

I got this one and liked it so much I moved on to the $1.99 upgrade and I am very pleased with all the extras it has. I still use this one. My friends are really interested to see it.

But I like to think that it may be a spirit attached to an antique that we may have. I honestly think that that would be really awesome but I'm not getting much clues because the only words I got where pink, shelf, automobile, soldier was a good one and my first one i also got fourth, fellow, and some other bland words."}

I screamed and showed my sister. Another thing happened when my friend, whose grandmother had passed earlier, was wearing a necklace her grandma had given her.

{"label": 1, "raw": "Ok people, God is real, the devil is real, and angels are real. So are spirits! Sometimes ghosts seek revenge, or they are friendly. This app is real. Here are what the signals : red, it is very strong. Yellow, strong. Green, weaker. Blue, barely there. This is real. Here's what it did to me one time: I was on my kindle fire on the couch, and it said &quot;wind&quot;. I thought it meant something, so I went to the weather channel. Believe it or not, but there was a big tornado watch in the south, thank goodness I don't live down there. I'm never trying in my bedroom, though. I'm afraid. I admit it. But this app is real.

I tried joking around and trying to communicating to the 'ghost'. At the top, it said 'Observe'. My cousin said, &amp;#34;What is your name?&amp;#34; And it said 'Joe' and then a huge yellow dot appeared in front of us, and the top said 'Shimmering' It scared me really badly, and I deleted the app instantly.

If your littler and its at night and your looking at this app it will scare you to death!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "You know why you can't get it on Kindle Fire? It doesn't have a camera, and all devices you can download on do. It utilizes the camera without you knowing, and it identifies the object and says the word. This explains why it needs so much information- it wires to the camera. I didn't realize this until I read you couldn't get it on the fire and it uses a lot of info. If you don't beleive me, you don't, but an app can't utilize 1,000-5,000 dollar equipment."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have been constantly dreaming of my mom and feeling haunted by her.  she died 11 years ago. I ran across this app today and had to try it.  I recently got a new wedding ring that I have been walking around my house gazing at.  a red dot appeared today and the word Mrs. was spoken!  the question of my ex appeared (his name)  followed by Available.  key words that only I would understand kept appearing.  my oldest son was a baby when my mother died. I allowed him to try and speak with her,  a red dot appeared and the word Giant and My was said.  too many on point coincidences for me.  I say it is worth the download if you are curious.  But be careful!  you never know what or who you are inviting in your home."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Okay, so I downloaded it and turned it on.  At first there was nothing happening but then it started lighting up all over the place. I was watching &quot;Moby Dick&quot; with the volume up high. It said, &quot; look&quot;, &quot; letter&quot;, &quot;auithor&quot;, &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;William&quot;. I turned the volume off and asked,&quot; William who?&quot; No response so far although a hurricane warning from msnbc did pop up while I was typing this and scared the crap outta me.

{"label": 1, "raw": "This would be great for kids at a slumber party or for really naive adults who believe every speck of dust in a picture is an orb.I bought the free version and I liked it well enough and then I bought the paid version which is no different from the free version in any noticeable way.With the paid version, it's almost as though it is setup to shoot out random words and phrases at a certain interval. Maybe they thought people would get their moneys worth that way to give people who paid for it more fake excitement? It seems that way to me.If you're into the paranormal, I would download the free version just if you're curious but don't buy the paid version. The free version is better, in my opinion.Don't expect this to be a serious tool--it's just a toy."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "it kept giving me battery, life, eviction, and dog, and I couldn't figure it out.  finally, after turning on the radar, I saw the phone point to itself.

{"label": 1, "raw": "This app used to work great for me. I searched out many spirits, most of whom became fast friends (well, some of them were a bit decayed and they weren't so fast).My issues began after my recent demise in a construction accident. I wound up in a number of pieces. It can be quite challenging to keep track of all of them. This application does an adequate job of finding the big pieces like my legs but isn't sensitive enough for my fingers and nose. Since the little pieces are the ones that usually get lost, this is a serious drawback."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this application and opened it while I was in the car. there was the occasional blip on the radar screen but nothing significant. and while there were a few words that appeared it was meaningless and random at best. but... when I got home and turned it on it was a different story. not sure what the different colored dots mean however there were many dots and many words being spoken in my house. I was standing in the kitchen and thought to myself what was I just gonna do? it was it that moment that the word &quot;pot&quot; appeared on the screen. oh yeah that's right I was gonna go have some pot. so off to the garage me and probly most of the ghost in the house went to get our bake on. truly this is an amazing application full of surprises and dare I say a mind reader."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Thanks to this app I found out that my house is haunted.While I was working on my computer I fired this app up having no idea what to expect. I clicked on the \"Radar\" button and it showed 3 blue dots to my right, and 2 yellow ones in front of me. Then my phone says, \"Ignore\". I figure it's telling me to ignore the dots. (Which I assume were ghosts)?Then my phone starts popping off word after word. Are these ghosts having a conversation? It seemed like all nonsensical words. Well after a couple of minutes of this I said aloud, \"Go away ghosts, I'm trying to work here!\"Suddenly the radar went blank and for the next 20 minutes not another word came out of my phone. I finished my work and turned the app off.Freaky Man!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "So I just got this app today and as soon as I got on it, a word popped up said Sit. Which was weird bc I was sitting. so I started to say some names. names I said Grandma Brown, Grandpa Brown, Ben, Grandpa Wallace. then it popped up a word saying Fewer. then a few words came up I didn't understand like Fox, Entry and Simply. then I asked who this was and it popped up Dan Just now. It really creeped me out bc my dads name is Dan (he has not passed yet). Going to wait it out before I make my review a 5 star. I really recommend getting this app if you are into parnormal stuff."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I couldn't believe it when I saw it, but this app confirmed my worst nightmare- my wife is a ghost. I have always wondered why she could walk through walls or why she didn't have a reflection until now. It is a little strange being able to tell people that you are married to a ghost but once they meet her they see that she is an almost normal person. I haven't had the guts to tell my wife yet though, not sure how she is going to react. At least she isn't a zombie!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app unleashes the previously undocumented hardware in every Android device to communicate with the dead. This came in practical use I was able to find the ghost of my dead uncle and he directed me to where he buried his money- it would have been lost forever- or worse found by staff of the camp for disadvantaged children on who's land it was hidden.I also use this app to make sure the bathroom is clear before I take a shower or \"do my business.\" I really don't want ghosts of dead relatives watching me in there. It's kind on creepy when you think about it- now, no more worries!I might buy a 2nd phone just to keep this app on all the time."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Sometimes the words it gives you are creepier than playing on a ouija board. For instance: it said my dad's name. I haven't had contact with him in about 5 years. That night I see that he found me on Facebook and sent me a (20 days late) birthday message. I can't decide if I believe in the astronomical odds against that coincidence, or if there was something supernatural about it.If you don't believe in the ghost thing at all, I still say download it. You will probably have fun with it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got the game after reading the reviews and thought it would be fun just to try it even though I was pretty certain it was bogus.  A part of me sorta hoped that my little brother would find some way to communicate with me even though I know the kindle doesn't have a microphone. See he killed himself last July and I miss him so badly. Anyways, I started the game and walked around and got some random words like question and paragraph. I got bored and sat on the couch. Not much happened after that so I figured it needed movement so I started shaking it. Soon words came popping out but I froze when the word brother came up. The next word was beside. I kid you not! I couldn't help tearing up even though it was probably just random words that happened to sync up. Nothing interesting after that but it shook me a little."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "At first but it &quot;told&quot; me a lot of things that noone would know about. I turned it on this morning and one of the first things it said was, &quot;court&quot; holy cow!! My husband is in court this morning !! How would a simple app know my husband was in court??? I didn't download this until late last night, long after we were discusing his case. It also mentioned several other things that noone knew about let alone what seemed to be a cheesy app - believe me its not. It works. I even got 3 different names of spirits that may be here. Yes, we have A LOT of paranormal activity here.Yes I do believe in ghosts, I did before the app but this app is making me even more of a believer!!!What's even freakier is that I had gotten this app from getjar for free, the exact same app as this free app of the day and its free on Amazon today. I downloaded it late last night."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Im not saying I don't or do believe is ghosts. lets make that clear. but the point if this app I think is mote to just have fun. I mean seriously out the pal on your kids phone let them have fun with it. it's not the real deal. cause lets say ghost are real and the pros who have big equipment well. that equipment costs thousands of dollar's. now do you really think a phone even as advanced as the evo 3d which I have is capable of matching the hardware as of the pros? No. it's not. so I believe this app is not yo be taken serious but as just getbsome laughs out and dont be afraid to let the child inside of you out and just have some good ole fun.Deuces everybody DJ Collyder out and happy Halloween"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Okay, this is a perfect app for Halloween! My little nieces and nephew will get a kick out of it. Wanna know why? Because anyone thinking that a 99 cent app with actually detect real ghosts is insane. This is a funny little app that I rank right up there with the Magic 8 Ball. A cool bit of fun for the holiday.Those of you who are whining that it doesn't work for &quot;real ghosts&quot;? Stop it. Either call those ghost dudes on tv, or better yet use that money for therapy. You're welcome."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was a skeptic like most at first about this app.  Its nice and all for jokes to the gullable.  Just seemed to get some things right with the words it spoke.1st incident:  Was in the bathroom stinking up the place (#2) and then the app said, &quot;sell, memory, row&quot;.  I laughed at it and kept going.  When flushing, the toilet clogged up and I had a minor flood in the bathroom.  Its nothing large enough to &quot;row&quot; in, but I thought I would &quot;sell&quot; yall my &quot;memory&quot;....hahahaha.2nd incident:  Was in my room when it said &quot;useful, cutting&quot;.  So, I decided to investigate the house to see whats up.  Weird thing I found, my mother was clipping coupons.  Spooky right?5 stars for giving me something else to do and for being a spooky word generator.  As far as the radar, could be better."}

I got bored so I said outloud what word am I spelling; p-e-t-e-r. it said a bunch of random words for a while so I turned off my kindle. about five minutes larger I checked it again and the list of words it had said was seven. one of then was Peter!!!!!!!!!! I'm freaking out!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The title says it all. The reason I didn't give it a better score was not because of what it is or what is was supposed to be or do. It was just for fun.  It was because of the way it worked. It used way to much system resources and was nearly impossible to turn off. On more than one occasion I had thought I had turned it off only to find it still running in the background. I couldn't find any setting to shut it off on exit. I had to use the app killer installed in order to close it. Quite annoying."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I purchased this app because I had always heard my friends talk about how on several occasions they had used it and had gotten spooked by it. Well after using it myself several times. The words it revealed did not make much sense to me. Last night while I was sitting reading a book, It said the words sit, book, and  drink. On the side of my chair I had a glass of tea. It gave me the creeps, I felt like I was being watched! I recommend this app to everyone or anyone that has ever doubted that their is such a thing as spiritual presence living among us."}

I screamed when something touched my back..and it was my cousins! those 4 sisters saw it all and threw a trick on me......but they swore to God they didn't touch the broom..men..it can happen....right?"}

I screamed because at first I thought I was surrounded by ghosts, but then my neighbor 'roommates' Ace and Gary came running over to see what was wrong and the scope was pointing right at them! Thats when I realised I had changed the setting from 'ghost' to 'fairy'.Now I can't go into a Starbucks without the thing pinging off the charts."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "the first moment I got this app it it went crazy with nonsense words like Russia, paper, whatever, hats and much more. the app is only good for pranking your friends. I would'nt recommend it if your trying to find real ghosts. just get the equipment if you want go look for real ghosts. to prove my point that this is a fake I went to over 50 houses with this thing over 2 months. every house had ghosts even the ones that were brand new and not on any burial  ground.  whatever. you do don't. waste your money."}

I've got student loan ugly face letters that I'm avoiding opening like the plague, I do write pretty funny texts to my friends daily, and as for William...I'm clueless. Some of this is, you'll pardon the pun, dead on but hell, creepiest thing is the digital voice. What do the different colored dots mean? One showed up blue with a red circle around it.

I have yet to find anything that I find relative to myself.  I have done a lot of research on this app because at one point it did keep saying &#34;Billy&#34; and I know no Billy, but about 3 days later a Billy comes by that my husband hasn't seen in a very long time.  I really think that it's just coincidence but it's always fun to play with the idea of the Ghost Radar, especially for the kiddos!"}

So many interesting words and full of ghosts outside, but not in our house pitifully.I will have to drag my tablet outside and have some fun listening to the words :DEdit: Ok, I have to edit my review. The app did detect a ghost inside. It said: Johnatan, sick, rest, care, lake, (At that time I stood up and moved away) Next words were move, come, hide and so on. At the same time, I heard two loud bangs in the bathtub.....spooky"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded Ghost Radar Classic (free)first. I got such a kick out of it that I splurged ($.99) and bought Ghost Radar. I have freaked out my 18-year-old daughter, and friends. Sometimes it spouts off words that make you go \"hummm.\" For instance I had it running (on my KFire) one morning as I was getting ready for work. I walked out into the hallway where one of my cats was sitting and suddenly the radar said \"feed\". Yes indeed the cat was waiting for me to feed him.Most of the time it says things that don't make much sense but I get a kick out of it just the same. Yes, I am easily amused. :)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is a fraud. It was unable to detect a known ghost living in my home for several decades.Back in the early 60s, a middle aged man was murdered in my home by a home intruder. This man's spirit has yet to leave the physical world for the spiritual as his murder has never been solved. He REFUSES to leave. This has been validated by several ghost hunting experts and I often hear him moaning about being hungry or tired.I tried using this app to detect his location but it wouldn't work. In fact, I knew he was in the bathroom at one point playing with the cat, but the app told me there was a \"reading\" in the kitchen.So, to sum it up, for those looking for something cheap to help them detect the ghosts living around us, look elsewhere.This app makes a mockery of the dead and the developers should be ashamed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "its stupid and pointless and ghost aren't even reel when you die you go to heaven or hell you cant go around the earth when your dead!!!! this is crape its totally stupid and its not real how would the developer get the app to sense all that stuff its crape lies!!! I mean seriously if your stupid enough to beloved this *omg it works I saw a ghost* -_- really?!...... get a life spud pickles and make something worth our time!!! God loves you :D"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this for free, just in time for Halloween, for my kids to play with.  My daughter made fun, at first, but her younger brother loved it.  It struck his imagination, and he started ghost-hunting immediately.  After dark, even the teenager got in on the fun.The only problem I've found is that it KILLS YOUR BATTERY FAST.  The app says it basically uses all if your sensors, microphone, etc., so I'm sure that is why, but keep it in mind.I'm not saying it's a great ghost-hunting tool, but it's a cute little app that has given my kids hours of fun."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I tried the app Word Frenzy on my Kindle Fire and I thought it was OK. It wasn't a game that kept me really interested or one I wanted to play just to waste some time. I have tried other word game apps that are better than this one. I didn't dislike the game, just didn't really like it either. I think what really gives me this opinion is the game doesn't have any eye catching graphics. Everything is different shades of green. It is free so try it and see if you like it, if you don't you aren't out any money!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app gives you a string of letters and about 30 seconds to make as many words as you can.  Then it moves on to another string of letters.  I find some sets easy, and others challenging, but I have always been able to think of at least one word for any set.  Even with the easy sets, I have to think fast to get a three-letter word, four-letter word, and so on, before it changes sets.It's great for when I'm not sure how much time I'll have to play because I can quit a game any time.  This is a must-have app for Wordies.  No problems loading on mySamsung Galaxy Tab, it doesn't hang up, and there are no intrusive ads."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "While the name suggests a simple application, the dev did (is doing?)  a good job. Very configurable, with different lines and coin requirements, and multiple near complete themes. I say near complete because there is only one set of sounds. The dev may be intending to add more as there is a custom theme option which allows you mix and match machines, symbols, and sounds.The graphics are done pretty old for the machine, symbols done much better. The game runs very stable and smoothly."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Gave it a high rating as it's free and does more than i thought it would for free. Alot of free app's are just that free, you open and u can't use most of the features cause thay want a fee to do so. This one is simple to use and move around in. Streaming live TV, news vid's, news articles, my stocks watch list, and alot more. Sometimes with a weaker connection u can't load vids or watch live TV. but everything else loads well on weak signals. I recommend this app to all."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a great app and it's FREE. Not only did it make finding a good wi-fi  connection for my Fire easy, but it also helped me improve my wireless signal for my pc. Easy to use and - Thanks to the developers for not shoving any BUY THIS - DO THAT at me. I understand the need to make some income from your work, that's only fair,. So if you need the cash so badly, please don't offer it for free.Easy to use and does just what it says."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "What can I say other than it works like a charm! Open it up and, if you have the graph selected, you can see all the wireless signals in the area, centered on its channel, and the height of the peak corresponds to signal strength. Walk around the house to see how the signal strength changes. Surprisingly, there were several more signals - about 3X as many than shown on my phone or laptop - picked up by this app.  I installed a wireless extender and was able to optimize its location using Wireless Analyzer. There's a lot more it can do, but this alone has me sold!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is reason enough to get an Android device.  The information it provides regarding channel usage on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands is essential if you want to set up devices and wifi routers for the best possible performance.  Sure, you can get fancier products from Fluke and others, but if you go that route you'll pay hundreds of dollars and have more junk to tote around.For most Android apps there are several functional alternatives.  Wifi Analyzer stands alone.The associated Wifi Connector Library is useful if you want one-click sign-ons to different networks."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I usually know where the hot spots are in my neighborhood, and I sure know where there are no networks on my hikes, but this analyzer told me when I was having problems with connectivity in my home office. I started \"losing strength\" a couple of nights ago (the bars went from 5 to 1) and, with a business network account, this just shouldn't happen. But I used the Wi-Fi Analyzer and sure enough, mine was one of the weakest of six networks in the area. Then I noticed a pattern: always weaker at night. Last night, I had to \"reinstall\" the connection, and today it was confirmed by my provider that they've been having problems. The Wi-Fi Analyzer got me a one-month credit! (Results may vary: I've been with the same provider for 5 years.)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've long hunted for an app that gives me the kind of WiFi signal strength and access point info for my home networks in a format that is easily understood, and WiFi Analyzer takes the cake. Using this app I was able to configure the twelve networks we have here in our college housing apartment complex so they don't conflict with each other, so they have the best signal strength possible, and much more. Everyone here who uses our WiFi saw a huge improvement, and it was thanks to this app. And it's free. You really can't beat that. Five stars."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was always getting spotty wifi at the outer reaches of my house.  this app helped me see that I was sharing the same channel with three other routers.  selecting a channel that wasn't so crouded really helped.I wish there was a indicator explaining that some of the higher channels are for international use and may not currently be enabled on the device running the app. I accidently set my router to one and didn't realize it and spent dome time trying to figure out why my device no longer saw the router."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I give it 3 rather than 5 stars because it does work very well, however the installation process is not straight forward if you need to set it up using a web browser rather than pushing a WPS button on your router. In Method 2 &#62;&#62; Setup via Web Browser in Step 3 you are directed to a web site to complete the process. That web site is for sale. The Tech Support number takes you to China and while they were helpful in getting me set up, they are more demanding and fast paced than I prefer.If your router has a WPS button to connect devices to your network this is a good device at a good price."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a very helpful little app that does a great deal considering it is free:It can analyze the strength of your own wifi system.It can analyze the strength of wifi systems around you.It provides data on how well your network is operating.It can tell you the strength of the signal of your network and others around you.You can use it to figure out where there are dead zones in your wifi system and figure out more easily how to correct them.The old maxim, \"You get what you pay for,\" certainly isn't true with this excellent app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "First of all, at this time it was free.  Having said that, I would pay for the app later if they came out with a Pay version.  I am very visual and it immediately showed all the WiFi connections in my block.  It has several screens that show the information in graphic format and one screen that shows the strength in a full screen \"Vu Meter\".  This helps with the Kindle finding a sweet spot in the house.  I am using it on a new Kindle \"Fire\" and it does not appear to have any problems at all.  Another real nice feature is that it shows on one of the color screens the channel you, and others are on.  This helps as I was able to move to the \"high end\" on my router while most of the others in my area were clustered around the low area.  Once again ... very nice, visual, application for use with my new Kindle Fire.  Thank you"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a fun app.  It has helped me figure out what Wi-Fi's are available around my house and while traveling.  It is fascinating to ride in a car (don't do this while driving!!!) and watch the various Wi-Fi networks come and go.  What blows my mind is that at work there are at least 3 at any one time.  I work in a huge building that has no work related Wi-Fi, so this means people must have hot spots near me."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app, is quite similar to  the other free one.  Sometimes it's a little harder to figure out, but still simple enough. This type of program just gives you a better view of what Wi-Fi's are around, and also more entertaining than what is on your Android device, but usually of not serious use, so what I like about this one, is that it can be moved to the SD card, and it does work on the Froyo version (and later) versions of Android.  This way I do have an entertaining informative app that isn't taking up valuable space."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "When you move, your Wi-Fi modem just might be having problems because everyone in your neighborhood is on the same channel.  WiFi Modems use channels like Walkie Talkies, and when there are too many on the same channel, your WiFi Devices have a hard time reaching your modem.  This little gem will tell you who is on what channel, and what channels are not being used so that you or your internet provider can change the channel to one that is not being used, and you can enjoy delay free streaming!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "We have so many people in my area with Wi-Fi networks, it's difficult to get a good signal.  I installed the Wi-Fi Analyzer on the Kindle Fire and found the conflicts in my neighborhood.  With that information, I adjusted the channel on my network.  I have fewer conflicts now.  Surfing is smoother, fewer dropped connections.I especially like the graphs.  I am a visual person and the graphs clearly illustrate signal strength and conflicts at a glance. There is also a screen that will give every channel a star rating and recommend the best channel setting for the router.  I don't even have to think about it!  What a great app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like this little Wi-Fi analyzer app.  It performs well and is very convienient.  It was simple to install and gives me a neat colored signal graft on how effective my Wi-Fi router is working on my Kindle Fire.  It also shows on the graft the other possible routers to click on if you wanted to go that route.  The graft is done up very nicely in multi-colors for each Wi-Fi channel available to you at any given time. At the very bottom of the screen is a tiny boxed ad that changes...it does not take away from the graft or annoy the person. If you travel from your home Wi-Fi router set up, this little app helps to change to an available Wi-Fi signal.  Pretty helpful!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is the best wifi detector i have seen.  It gives you a very good picture of the signals around you.  You can place your wifi on the channel that is used the least to avoid interference.  Just walking around the room with this thing is pretty interesting.  Driving down the road with it is even more fun.  I'm not sure how the other functions are used but the spectrum display is all anyone would need.  The screen gets really crowded in town.  The only improvement I could see would be to have the option to highlight the open systems so that you can pick them out of the crowd."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a cool little app.  I use it to sniff around places while I'm out and discover any WiFi hotspots I can connect to.It's also useful to see what channels are in use in your neghborhood (2.4GHz or 5GHz) so you can move your AP to a non-used channel further away from all the others who are running the default channels that came with their wireless box.  Everyone in a neighborhood running on channel 11 or 6 or nn is not good.  Its also useful to determine the type of encryption being used by the various networks before trying to connect to a network.  I also use it to determine which band on my dual-band network gives me the greatest signal strength when I'm in the far away rooms of my house so I can connect to the strongest."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a handy little utility for detecting Wi Fi sources in your vicinity. Within moments, you can see what other users are online in your area and what channels they are using, for both 2.4 and 5 GB. If you live or work in a crowded environment with lots of sources, you can more readily select a channel that will minimize interference. The information is available in a number of formats.Obviously, a utility like this doesn't do much, but it uses very little memory and is easy to use, so it' good to keep it on your device until you need it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a good app to analyze the wi-fi signals around you...and if you live in a suburb there will be many.  Just about everyone now has a wi-fi router in their home.  This app identifies every signal within range and can graph their strength.  This is good as you can walk around your house/ airport/ coffee shop/ whatever and find the areas with strong signals/weak signals.  The best part is the real-time graph which clocks signal strength over time.  You can even do a screen shot and send it via e-mail."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Analyze the signal strength of any wireless connection. Determine if your wireless router channel is receiving any conflicting signals from other electronics, microwaves, etc. Choose the channel with the least interference for the best wireless connection. determine signal strength in different areas of your home. Do you need to move your router? Do you need a signal booster? Are you having fluctuations in your signal strength? Does your neighbor have a stronger signal than you? Which public wi-fi signal is the strongest? I have had this great app for a day and it has already helped me answer those questions and more."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is the first wi-fi analyzer I downloaded, but being curious, I downloaded a few more, but this is the best of the bunch. It has the most features and the easiest to understand features. I even paid for one of the other ones that I downloaded because it had pretty pictures, and it was the most worthless. This wi-fi analyzer is now my most useful app. It continues to amaze me how wildly a signal will vary, especially if it is a so-so signal to begin with."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is perfect for those times when you're totally stumped on a crossword.  You enter the letters you have and question marks for the blanks, and it will give you a list of possible words.  Clicking on a word will show the definition.  Doesn't work for proper names, unfortunately, nor does it work if the answer is multiple words (e.g. \"peanutbutter\").  May return a huge list of words if you have too many blanks.No ads!  Huzzah!Works great on both the Evo and the Xoom."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I loved this app. It is interesting and fun. It levels. are challenging and make you think. You can change the speed of the orbs and you can choose between two moods, survival mode and regular mode. What more can you ask for. I loved it all of it, except for the time limit. I mean several times I was one orb away from beating the level, and time ran out. I found that incredibly annoying. I would have played survival mode, but I like beating the levels. I really loved how the levels were layed out though. The idea of going through tubes to get to other tubes is genius. I highly reccomend this app it is 100% worth the price. If you are looking for a fun entertaining and somewhat addicting app, look no further. Dragon Fire is here."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "If you're a person that likes puzzles, this game is for you. I'm not exactly a puzzle person, but I got it for free while they were having a special. If you're not a puzzle person, DON'T GET IT. I mean, I don't regret getting it, but that's because I got it for free. If you don't like puzzles, then it's definitely not worth paying for. And for everyone who's complaining about it not having a colorblind option, what do expect? I'm sorry, but there's a MINORITY of colorblind people in America. They're not gonna make a whole other game that like, 10% of Americans would buy because they're colorblind. Also, if you're colorblind and you bought a Kindle Fire, if you have any sense to think ahead, you wouldn't have gotten one for apps, because most apps have color in them.

{"label": 1, "raw": "Game is good... Probably would give it a 4 based on an honest assessment.  It's well done, but not awesome.I could care less about colorblind mode and certainly wouldn't rate the game down for not having it.  If I was colorblind, I'd just email the dev and see if he might include it with an update.And Superman75 is humorous, but inconsistant.  Last month he was a disgruntled Jew, and this month he's in a cult on a mountain.  Whatever -"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I agree with another reviewer here, who pointed out that this Dragon Fire lacks an option to change the settings of the game, in the event the player is colorblind.As a colorblind American, who has extreme difficulty telling the difference between reds, yellows, and greens in software, I encourage game developers to include options to turn on a &quot;colorblind&quot; mode.Many game developers, such as PopCap, already routinely feature this in their games.This game, Dragon Fire, would be greatly improved if such a feature was added in a future update."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really enjoyed this game. It was nice to be able to slow down the fireballs for certain levels so I could keep track. Even on the slowest setting some of the levels could still be pretty challenging at first. I played this on Kindle Fire. Probably would be harder on a small phone.Only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is that there aren't enough levels. I finished the whole thing in a couple of hours. I also wish there was some bonus for finishing every level with a perfect score."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've used Splash ID since the Palm m505 days.  Over the years it's been very reliable and stable.  It doesn't offer as much GUI distractions as some of the other password storage programs, so it does look/feel dated.

Version 6 wireless synchronous works very well, better than previous versions.The interface in this version takes some time to learn but is pretty good. After using version 4 for a few years, I've had difficulty finding some functions and features but no serious issues.The big problem with this version is that the App locks every time I switch to another App. I open SplashID Safe,  enter the password, get a password for a web site, switch to the browser and then return to SplashID only to find I must enter the password again even if only a few seconds passed since I entered it.SplashData tech support says the lockout delay was removed for security reasons. They are working on a solution to add the lockout delay back into the App. The Aneroid App is practically useless to me if this defect is not corrected."}

The \"Cheese Mode\" is fun, but I will not be using it regularly.The app installs and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO and Kindle Fire.Highly Recommended!CFH"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Downloaded this as a FAotD. Great deal. It provides detailed information about the moon phase, as well as a beautiful, detailed image in the main app. Loads quick, no issues on my HTC Amaze (Gingerbread 2.3.4). Turning on the detailed shadows brings the image alive....But wait there's more -- you can interact with the image, dragging the phase and seeing what day that will be. Changing the date to go forward or back in time. Dragging the image to see the dark side of the moon. It's fun!But wait there's more -- Moon Phase Pro provides a Live Wallpaper that turns my HTC Sense lock screen into a changing image of the moon. (It's a shame to hide it under home screen widgets and icons.)But wait there's more -- the app gives you several dynamic home screen widgets, with or without data at a tap. So much for that last bit. ;) )I like this app, and heartily recommend it."}

Unless, you're a NASA scientist, I can't think of a single thing that this app doesn't provide.

I love the intuitive way you navigate on this app to enter your specific location and other \"what if\" information.  I was literally up and enjoying this app within less than five minutes.Who knows...when I become a NASA scientist maybe I won't like this app, but until then I'm going to stay inside (you go out in the cold MichaelH) and enjoy all the neat stuff this app has to offer!"}

{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is an interesting calendar tool and astronomical guide to lunar activity.  On the main screen it shows you what the moon will be like today.  You have to enter in your location to get accurate information.  What I like is that by touching the calendar symbol at the top you get a monthly calendar and it shows the lunar status for every day of the upcoming month.  You can even look months ahead.  If you touch a day the lower  of the screen provides a larger view of the moon on the day you selected.By touching the data button you can review all of the lunar activity for that day with all of the scientific data provided to you.  The place button wants you to enter you location to provide you accurate lunar data.  You also have a clock function in order to advance the data or time to see the changes in the view of the moon.I gave this app 5 stars for the quality of the data provided and its uniqueness.

The fact that planting by the phases of the moon might have that kind of effect fascinates me.  And being only a so-so gardener, I can use all the help God can give.  This was a Christmas freebie.  It offers information on moon phases.  Garden season is approaching.  Here's hoping this helps!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This Is just something I downloaded for entertainment. However, I seem to have a curiosity on the phase of the moon. This program does that. It even has some other features such as a calendar to show what phase of Moon will be in on a particular day of the month.There are a few things that were a little rough around the edges. This program can be moved to the SD card. This is a very important feature, since most of my tablets are of the older variety and is good to make room on the main flash drive. The first time I ran this program on the card, it really didn't want to work. But that was the only time that it complained. It has fired up correctly since then. It does not show correctly what part of the moon is lit up, though the amount that seem to be correct.So, it is something to play around with, and doesn't take any space on the main memory."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Stunning moon images in this very easy to use moon phase app. Controls are easy to find and use. And app is extremely easy to set up. All I had to do was enter my city and state to get the current phase of the moon. The calendar of moon phases is also excellent. You can check the phase of the moon for any day, just for fun I checked what it was when I was born. Also very impressed with the responsiveness of the developer. I would have been happy to pay for this app, but I got it as the free app of the day. Kindle Fire. For a laugh, be sure to check out cheese mode."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is awesome. The graphics are so amazing, it's like you are at space camp looking at the moon through a telescope. You can see it with several different graphics settings too. It's so cool to turn the moon with my stylus or fingers, on my Kindle Fire HD, to view all sides of the moon. It even adjusts the date and time, when you spin it to accurately display the time your hemisphere will or did see the moon from that angle. There is also a calendar button so you can view the different moon phases for each day of the previous, current, and future month(s). Love it! And it's really only 70&cent; with the 30&cent; credit Amazon gives. Totally worth 70&cent; if you are into the moon or it's phases/cycles."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Starting easy, this puzzler has you match two orbs in a line to eliminate them from the field.  Eliminating all orbs from the field completes the level.  Later levels have you matching 3-4 orbs and stars (count as 2 orbs) to clear them.  The graphics are good and the sound is decent.  Oddly enough, the story is what kept me playing through all 100 levels.  The lack of an ending to that story is the only reason I dock this game a star."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm not sure about all the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this game. The graphics are fine, but I've definitely been more impressed with visuals in other games (like Osmos HD or even Hex Defense). The backgrounds seem quite similar to the live wallpaper on my phone. Cool, but not &quot;wow&quot;!The game's instructions are vague in some respects, and the mumbling spirit could use a grammar proofreader (&quot;be awared!&quot;). After completing the first area, and some of the second, I honestly can't see the 5 stars people are giving this app. I mainly downloaded it because I was suspicious of the reviews."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "One of the things I look for is &#34;unique&#34; games -- games that provide something that isn't already available in dozens of other games.  (Can you say &#34;match-3&#34; or &#34;hidden object&#34;???)  Totemo begins as a very simple concept, but quickly graduates into some extremely challenging levels, all based on math and logic.  There is some &#34;background story&#34; -- though it does not affect the gameplay at all, and frankly is pretty mundane for the most part.  But anyone who likes a logic challenge should enjoy this game."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a game that will stretch your pattern recognition skills. Basically, you need to remove circles in groups. They have to be in columns or rows. Each level seems to have a couple of \"keys\" that will help you get started. I didn't need more than one try for a level until I got into the 20s. I find that it is very satisfying to clear a board.The visuals are pleasing. I think that this is a game that I will enjoy playing for a few minutes here and there until I finish it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "My husband used this app when my soon was born and it was great! Being able to sync the day's goings on with the baby is so helpful, especially if you have one working parent and one stay at home parent or care giver or a child on medication daily that needs to be tracked. I would love to see this app used in a childcare facility. Being able to instantly see what's logged is great to keep everyone feeling like they're involved in baby's day even when they're at work. Granted I haven't used it in months, but the Dev was responsive and even considers user recommendations! Must have for new parents!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is great.  I tried several other apps that were similar but this was the only one that did ALL I needed.With this app you can do all below:Monitor and graph your child's growth and firsts.Graph your 7day, month, all times.  It is really neat to see the changes in what my daughter has done over the past year and a half.You can have more than 1 child and it is very easy!  I am having twins and already have them setup in my profiles.  =)It is always great to stop in at the pediatrician for a checkup and know the exact answers to those pesky questions:  How many ounces is she eating a day?  How many diapers, on average, a day?  This app shows me all of that in a time frame that I choose!It does so much more!I added all different activities as well.  Pictures and I go on!Enjoy!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I would have rated this 5 stars if I was able to change the appearance of the face of the card. I don't like the way the numbers, symbols and letters look. It is different than the one I have on my phone and I can change it on my phone, but it's the same game. I would like it to look the same. It doesn't have the &#34;standard&#34; look, it is very large and I like to whip through the game and it is hard to scan it quickly if your eyes aren't used to it. But I still love this version of the game and I am super glad I got it. It works great on my phone and kindle fire, so problems."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The \"ZombieBooth\" app allows you to zombify anyone in a picture, usually with good results. Full face images without cluttered backgrounds are best. The zombie on the screen will react to touching the screen by attempting to bite the finger and static images can be exported and saved.Tried this on a statue in church and, surprisingly, it worked but I got in trouble with my wife so will not be doing that again anytime soon. Still might be fun at a museum...This installed and ran perfectly on my HTC EVO running Android v2.3.3Recommended!CFH"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "but I'm hoping for some improvements.

(there are settings, but they've never worked for me)speedTumblr integrationplus when I compare to the browser, there are lost updates.I still use it, of course, but if anyone comes out with an app to address those problems with similar benefits, I'm switching right away, cute raccoon or not."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Seesmic is usually the go-to Twitter client on my smartphone, but I was disappointed to find out this tablet version doesn't function properly on my Kindle Fire HD. It keeps saying 'authentication failed' whenever we try to add a Twitter account.I've kept the app hanging around on this tablet hoping that they would correct the problem in an update, but apparently that won't be happening -- perhaps because Seesmic is now owned by HootSuite, which has its own app it develops. That's unfortunate because Seesmic is the only Twitter client I know of that has a 'combined view' feature that merges our multiple accounts."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Tweetcaster has more features, but Seesmic was enough. I liked that Seesmic didn't ask for access to low level system log files (like Tweetcaster does) but disliked that it wanted my GPS data. Seesmic has a nice refresh button. It is hard to tell when something has been retweeted, and by whom. FB integration did not work for this Kindle Fire user, either. I would also have liked the ability to use a darker theme. I am keeping Seesmic and not Tweetcaster mostly for the data access issue."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app does what I got it to do, which was to handle the feeds to and from my facebook account. I can post my status updates easily, message friends, search, and read updates and view pics.  In other words, it does the basics well.  I also like that several posts that I was not seeing with Facebook's app were suddenly appearing.However, I noticed that one of my regular friends suddenly was not available through Seesmic (I checked the website, and she hadn't unfriended me!).  The other thing that I can't find is how to check in from a location).  For me, if those two issues were fixed, the app would get a 5."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really love this game or the japanesse version Nectaris. I regret the screen is for this specific app reduced for cellphones and not customized for tablets. Also the levels are not so great than the original nectaris-pc engine or Turbografx16 neither the PC/DOS version which is my favorite so far however I need to have a DOS emulator to play it. Still this is a very good alternative for mobiles and not so great on tablets. Another alternative is to get the PCE EMU and get the Turbografx rom (if you own it as I do ) but again for a cellphone this is great app"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've been playing Military Madness/Nectaris since it was new on the Turbo Graphix 16 here in the U.S.  This version was very playable with a single finger interface.PROS:I can't think of any of the Turbo Graphix 16 original vehicles that didn't make it, they all seem to be here.Control scheme works well.Entertaining.Game mechanics still hold up well.Cheap!Cons:The AI is weak. I blew through this game quicker than I should have.If you're used to hitting the \"back\" button on your Android Phone to back off of controlling a unit it could back-fire since that exits the game without saving.  (takes some getting used to)No network / multi-player.I recently noticed there were \"bonus\" levels after beating the \"final\" level by selecting the chose map screen and clicking on the level that appears without the progress road attached.  The final levels, 19 & 20, are actually rather challenging."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I agree with the others that the price is a bit steep for what you ultimately get: a simple timed word-forming game in the style of Text Twist. I was originally optimistic about this game, but once I played it a few times I realized that the only \"goal\" is to try and beat my own high score... over and over again. This may be perfect for some people, but I have become increasingly accustomed to games that offer a variety of different backgrounds and other rewards; I tend to be ambivalent about the rash of games that don't have these things, despite the capabilities to make them. I think one redeeming point here is the \"hidden words\" section -- but that's about it. By my third play, I was a bit tired of testing the limits of my vocabulary in the way this game wants me to."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Today I used the option for TWL06, word list for the USA and Canada.  It rejected the word BORN I made.  Hmmm... tried it again, verrry slowly just to make sure I clicked the letters correctly the first time.  And I see B O R N clear as day and click submit.  Then a big fat red NO! flashes AGAIN.  WHAT KIND OF DICTIONARY ARE THESE FOLKS USING FOR THIS APP?  Heck, its probably even a word in the default word list for EUROPE (SOWRD or something like that).  Makes you wonder how accurate the REST of the word database is!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I can't believe I spent actual money on that, let alone time. Game play itself was cute, and the graphics were good, but otherwise not a great investment. Not only were some clues completely non-intuitive, but it took all of an hour to get through. That's it. I would have hoped it would take at least a few hours to justify the price, but no. And it's not as if I'm some skilled gamer who whips through games day in and day out. I'm very much a casual, infrequent game-player, yet this was mostly way too easy for me. You're not missing much, believe me."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've been mulling over purchasing this game for a few weeks now.  Yeah, yeah, I know, it's only a $1.  But, if I spent $1 on every game/app that I thought I'd spend more than a few minutes with...Anyhow, I am happy to say I'm very pleased with it.  The graphics, background music, and sound effects all blend well together into a spooky feel.  Controls are easy to work with and respond well.  Gameplay is similar to the old Myst titles, where you wander around solving puzzles and finding clues.  Performance on my Epic was perfect, not a single hitch with it.  Hope to see more games like this one!Hopefully this review was helpful for you.  If not, feel free to leave comments/questions."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is very reminiscent of games like the Myst series, 7th Guest and 11th Hour.  Its a bit quirky and the storyline is a bit obtuse which leaves one with a very loose idea of where to look next in some areas.  In games like this the fun is all in the delivery, the story unfolding.  Unfortunately thats where this one falls short... and speaking of short.. if the delivery were better and the clues/solutions a bit more logical this game would take all of about 10 minutes to play though.  I wish I could give this a 5 star rating but even though it is entertaining and has a good atmosphere it just leaves you wishing for more. But the creators have my sincere appreciation and applause. I wish more gaming companies would work to supply the fans of this genre with hours and hours of entertaining deduction."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I purchased this for my Kindle Fire because I really enjoyed playing The Lost City, but this was a disappointment.  Although graphics quality is excellent, this is really, REALLY too short.  It took me maybe an hour to complete it. Also the last puzzle was really finicky (blue circles on basement door) and the lightest touch will cause it to reset so that even if you've solved it once, you're forced to do so again (and again). Also, the ending was lame - a real anticlimax.It was also pretty easy, but I don't mind this if there are a lot of visually interesting scenes or landscapes.  In this game the graphics were nice but again there were only around ten different settings."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded The lost city when it was free, and I loved it. (It wasn't too short, but I wouldn't of been dissapointed if it had been longer.) I read the reviews for The secret of Grisly manor, and seeing it was made by the same people as The lost city, I bought it for $0.99. I had read reviews, and some people said it was very short, and I figured it would be as long as the other one (Which took me about a week). I was very wrong..I could've finished it in half an hour.So I gave The secret of Grisly Manor 4 stars, because I was dissapointed in the length. (In my opinion. it should be free - it wasn't long enough to be worth even a dollar.)If you're going to purchase one, purchase The lost city - you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is fun! I love the mystery games with the puzzle elements, and these puzzles don't disappoint! They're challenging enough that you'll scratch your head for a bit, but won't be too difficult for the sake of being difficult.My main problem with this is that its too expensive. Almost 2 dollars for a game that you can beat in less than an hour? I've spent 4 dollars on other apps that have a gameplay of 20+ hours and its still going. Wish it was longer, or at least that they would make a free version with advertisement throughout the game."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have this running on a Droid R2-D2 (Droid 2) and I haven't had any of the force close issues that other users are apparently experiencing.I find the game to be interesting and fun.  I'm not very good at these types of games, mainly because I don't have much experience with them, but that hasn't stopped me from continuing to explore the mansion as best I can.I like the graphics and the music.  The challenges are interesting and for me a bit challenging, but again it may just be my experience that's holding me back.Overall, I like it quite a bit."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was worried about this game playing on my Kindle Fire but it played beautifully. I see a lot of complaints about it being too short and it is a bit quickly played only if you're familiar with this type of game. Besides the game is only  49&cent;. I just wish it was longer because it was so fun. I did need online help with some of it. For players new to this type of game, ignore nothing and tap on every inch of the screen because if you don't you will feel like a complete idiot when you get help and realize the answers are staring you in the face. I know I did."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I bought this after playing The Lost City, and perhaps I should have reversed that choice.  Unlike The Lost City, this game does not have the hint and map features, so it's up to you to figure out the clues and locate the puzzle pieces.  That being said, I finished the game in a few hours and wished there was more to it.  I agree that it could have been longer with more screens. Again, the graphics were nicely done, the puzzles fairly easy to solve, and it worked well on my Kindle Fire.This had a nice balance between clever and challenging clues.I probably would have been less disappointed if I had played this game first and followed it with The Lost City."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I liked this game a lot. I had to do a web search for hints a couple of times. I guess I just didn't have the patience to actually figure it out on my own. This was one of the first games I got in this genre, and I really enjoyed it. It was over pretty quickly. Felt like it could have had a bit more added to it, because felt short. I didn't feel ripped off or anything, just wished it had been longer. Fire Maple does a good job! Since finishing this game I have bought other games they have come out with and enjoyed them even more! Just buy it already, it's good."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I enjoyed the game very much. There is not a help/spoiler file, but it's really not needed. The one place I got stuck - throw the pretty box in the fire! The graphics are beautiful, the play is smooth. The sound is not as good as the sound on The Lost City, but not bad. Really, this would get 5 stars if only it was longer. I'd prefer something like Myst; something to take days/weeks to complete, rather than a couple of hours."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "A great point and click game. You have to go through a house and find clues and apply them. No annoying hidden objects. All the clues are reasonable and discoverable, and you have hints available too. I only wish the game were a bit longer. This is also a good introduction to this kind of game for newbies or younger players, at least in part because you will be able to finish it and not have to go through fifteen scenes to get back to where you need. I wish Fire Maple would make more games like this!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This sounded like it converted EVERYTHING so I bought it. I work in a Nuclear Lab in the US and the first thing I wanted to do is convert millirem (mrem) to either microsievert (Sv) or millisievert (mSv). No go! Sievert is a common European radiation measurement. Works great for many others things and says it will convert radiation exposure measurements BUT I am still stuck looking it up on the web.Up date:After checking the web site for this app I see it does Radioactive Decay NOT Radioactive exposure like I thought...my bad. I raised to 4 stars (not 5) because for me Radioactive exposure is much more important then decay. Maybe it will be added??Up date:I sent e-mail to the developer with my suggestion and got a very positive reply right away. Very nice! I now believe this is a 5 stare app."}

Once the song is on my phone, I can listen even if I'm not in a WiFi area, and it doesn't need my data minutes either. You can sort by artist or album or song or genre, and you can make playlists too."}

Knocked off a point for losing this feature.  Not super thrilled with the new interface either, but change is change as far as aesthetics.  Bring back Add to Now Playing (like Add to Queue from Google Play Music)."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Amazon has earned my respect with this app. This isn't the old amazon mp3 player which wasn't bad but nothin special just like itunes with cheaper albums most of the time, but now this is the future of music in my honest opinion. The cloud player service makes this the best thing to happen to music in a long. Now you can upload all your music to there website and have access to all your music without taking up space on your devices anymore. Also great if you like me always have to transfer song from multiple devices now you can just upload or buy from amazon have access to everything instantly from any device that can use the service. Android phone/tablet pc or MAC computer. So you get to keep your music forever unlike itunes one time purchase and goodlook with keep your music safe. See even if you music device fails you instantly have all your music back.Thanks for making something we always needed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "After installing this app on a Samsung Galaxy S3, my battery power significantly decreased so much that my phone couldn't even make it through the work day. I uninstalled, the app, and my battery usage returned to normal.  So I installed a new battery in my phone and re-installed this app.  Again, battery power took a nosedive. And again, I uninstalled it.  I really would like to use this app, but it is doing something in the background that drains the battery."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Works on the Google Nexus 7-2 tablet, Not on the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet. The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone. The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in &#34;airplane&#34; mode. Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded didn't show up. On the phone, and trying to get to music via the cloud, Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you've already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days. Advice:  Boycott until they stop that and fix the app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm unsure what I'm rating here... I buy all of my tunes from Amazon, the prices are usually fair, there's no DRM telling me what I can and cannot play it on or how many times I can listen to it before it disappears (iTunes and Wally World, for instance). I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it &#34;clean&#34;!!! Not much &#34;storage&#34; space for things purchased in the past, so I store it on Google..."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "While the updates have been slow and I do feel the app is WAY to heavy, it is somewhat better. I still spend time clicking the same song 10 times while shopping trying to review it only to have the song 5 tracks down start playing. As a loyal customer to Amazon I do want them to have great apps to support the music I buy from them. However this app in the past few months has cut my music shopping/exploring time in half. Simply put, this app is not up to Amazon standards IMO."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really like this app. It has a lot of great features. I really enjoy the option of playing the music directly on the app, as well as downloading the music to your device. I actually use another app for playing the majority of my music on my phone, so the ability to download the music is great! And it downloads in a generic file type so that it is compatible with other programs.Amazon also offers the same app for download to your computer. That app is excellent! It offers the option to download and automatically add to iTunes."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The number one benefit of this music app for me is the ability to sync music to multiple devices easily with a wifi signal. That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love absolutely LOVE it because it's NOT i Tunes. I hate having to buy music threw a company that will only let me listen to it on their devices (without jumping threw hoops to download it).Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one. That also means no more, \"which device is that song on?\"!I LOVE IT!"}

You buy your music (the prices are very reasonable- to cheap) you download IF you want it on your device for anytime, anyplace listening. Or you can leave your tunes safe in the cloud so it does not take up any storage, you start the wireless and listen that way. Either way, the selection is nearly infinite. All the old classics to the newest hits....And best of all; NO Commercials!  And you don't have to listen to anything except what you want to hear. For listening on your phone or tablet, this is the real deal. No hidden fees. No upgrades. Just straight out jamming Your Way!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings. It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The app in its former life as the MP3 app was very good - at least 4 stars.  The new version is only worth 1 star.  What is most annoying is that whenever I startup the app it spams me with a full screen ad for Prime music with no obvious way to get to my music.  I thought this trick was reserved for malware.  I finally discovered that pushing the back &#34;button&#34; twice quickly on my device  I could get to my music.  This is not how an app which is supposed to stream music I pay for (either by purchasing it or by subscribing to prime) is supposed to behave.  I really wish there was an alternative app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I previously wrote a negative review years ago... But now? WOW! Prime Music has changed everything for me, and I'm happy to endorse this app and the service! I've deleted the old review and have totally changed my mind.My only complaint now is that this app is NOT compatible (or available) on Amazon Fire TV, and this just doesn't make sense! I can load Pandora and a dozen other music services on the Fire TV, but Amazon's own Prime Music service isn't available on their own hardware? WHY?!?  Amazon, PLEASE get with it and put this app on the Amazon Fire TV! I would definitely get a lot of use out of it!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this app on my smartphone. I can listen to any of the 431 Albums of music I've purchased from Amazon (over the years) on my phone, With headphones it sounds as good as an iPod. The app either lets you listen to the cloud songs, or to songs that you downloaded onto your device, my case being my smartphone.I would recommend this app for anyone who has a smartphone or Kindle (prob other tablets too) and who purchases mp3 songs/albums from Amazon. I ALWAYS use WiFi so I don't use data on my phone data plan. I've had no glitches, no freezing, no issues at all."}

The Google Music Manager still has unlimited space for free (or when you purchase music from them). that's where I will be headed when Amazon says my time is up, rather than getting nickled and dimed to death and having to choose and upload those 25 songs. Bah bye, Amazon. my next tablet won't be a Kindle."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I use my Kindle Fire at home to listen to music. Now I just grab my phone and get in the car and hook up with the blue tooth and have all my music with me. It's the same simple format as the Kindle and I can play right out of the cloud without having any music on my phone and all. I read all the reviews complaining about the app size. And I'm surprised that people so tech savvy have not figured out why they can't get the music to their SD cards. It's a business process, not a personal issue, or a technical aspect.I suggest they should put down their phones and live life a bit. Maybe even put a soundtrack to it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm a big Again fan in general. We have a kindle, three kindle fires and three Android phones in the family that heavily utilize Amazon apps. We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have HTC Rezound, and I don't know why, but this app does not work. I've updated it, reinstalled it completely and it still will not show my songs. If I flip back and forth (with the buttons) between store and music player/cloud, it will flash the song for half a second (I can see the album art), but there's no way to play it. My music just doesn't show up in the app. My husband also played with it, trying to get it to work, and had no more success than I."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "This app works as described. I have an EVO 4G and I did not experience any lags. The live wallpaper is almost like a mini game as you can tap on screen to make the jack-o-lanterns explode and the bats fall. There is a counter on the lower-left to keep track of how many you got. You are also able to select from 4 different backgrounds, fog amount and speed, pumpkin and bat amount. Overall this is a neat little app for this months event. The graphics look much better compared to the 4th of July fireworks live wallpaper app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a good app.  It doesn't do anything that IMDB on your laptop or desktop doesn't do identically.  However, if you want to experience a genius use of IMDB, install the Google Chrome Browser onto your laptop or desktop. Then add the free IMDB extension for that browser.  Next time you are reading about a tv show or movie, highlight it with your cursor.  All of a sudden, the extension lights up on your toolbar with a red number.  That number is the rating for the movie or tv show.  If you want to read more, click on that red number and a new tab will open and you are there on the very page and can read the synopsis, reviews, cast list, etc., I use it every single day."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Okay there was just an update, so some of this may have been addressed. I love the app when looking for a movie, and I am kind of an IMDb junkie so in general like the tool.The thing that was bugging me was the news feeds. They would get stale, and couldn't figure out how to refresh (and I am talking by weeks not hours).So that may have been addressed in the last release.Also would be nice to attach to Amazon more(since it is owned by them) so I could watch directly or see pricing easier but I may just not know how to work that.The trailer stream great even at 3G which is good when you got to entertain a 4 yo for a few minutes."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As has already been stated, this is really just another version of the mobile website, however I think that it has slightly better performance.  I prefer the app layout to the mobile theme because it just looks a little cleaner.That being said, IMDb is one of those websites that I can't live without.  Before I discovered IMDb, something or someone would come up in conversation and we would rack our brains trying to remember an actor's name or the name of the TV show that was being discussed.  Usually we wouldn't remember it and then sometime, days later even, in the middle of something completely unrelated, the name would pop into my head...  Alan Tudyk!  THAT'S IT!.  With IMDB, I can easily find what I'm looking for an get the answer immediately, rather than days (or weeks) later."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I haven't seen any reviews that include this, so I'll edit if I figure out a way to avoid this. When you die in the game, you start over. Not the level, no... the entire game. Back to the first dungeon. Also, apparently I have to be very careful about hitting quit, otherwise your progress won't be saved. Other than those two issues I have, the game is fun. I feel a little helpless when I can't find a new word though."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I am beyond frustrated.  Three times the game has completely disappeared in the middle of play.  When I open it again,  the game has started over.Then,  my last game I got to level ten on normal mode and out of nowhere the game to my touch.  I helplessly watched as I went from 20 hp to death.  What a waste.  Great concept,  game breaking bugs.  It wouldn't  be fair if I didn't write the developer to try and solve this,  so I will,  and we will see if my rating changes."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Interesting game. I could care less for the story line but the game with its levels and bonus letters is fun and challenging. The dictionary that you play with has words that even people with a good vocabulary will never find them all. I like that it reminds you if you have already used a word. and that it allows plurals and other varients of the same word. Makes the game fun even for the children. It has three levels of play and that is good too. Over all its a little above average. Not my favorite game but certainly not one to uninstall the first day you have it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a fun little game.  It really makes you think.  It took a while to figure out how to pause the game.  I got it for something different.  I was getting bored with the same old games I already had.  I am still on the \"Kid Mode\", and find it difficult.  I can only imagine what the \"Normal\" and \"Wizard\" modes are like.  One mode at a time.My only gripe is that it does not recognize some basic everyday words.  And then, when it gives you a word, it is usually one I have never heard of."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The game is fun until you get halfway through it and get a set of letters with no vowels so that you can't even make a word. When this happens, you can only sit there helplessly and watch yourself lose. I'd rather lose based on my own abilities not because the randomness of the game left me without any ability to continue. Fix this and you'll get your fifth star. May I suggest some sort of scramble option, even if it cost you points or abilities or something? May I also suggest code that makes absolutely sure there are 1 or 2 vowels in the letters at all times? Thank you!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The free Audible for Android app is a great option for me, as using this on my clunky, obsolete Entourage Pocket eDge tablet frees up so much space on my Kindle and ipod. The device is no longer upgradable, and is stuck at 2.1 or something. Few of the newer apps work on this device but I just got it last Sept from Woot at a deep discount and want to keep it as my tablet for now. I get such a charge when something works well, and the sound quality from the eDge is great to my tin ears. The Amazon apps are very hit or miss for this discontinued brick so I will be happy when I can get a K-Fire (II?) down the line."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like this app a lot and have listened to several books.  You get one free audible book and after the first month, there is a monthly fee.  If you are pinching pennies this might not be for you.  You get a free credit each month for one free book.  To me, that more than pays for the fee.  There are also offers for books that can be purchased at low rates. I bought a book for $7.95 this month.  It's a very good deal, for me. It's easy to order books...I go to audible.com on my desktop computer, browse through the books, and place my order. I wait a few minutes, go to my Kindle and bring up the Audible book App...click on download. Some books take several minutes to download...Easy Peasy! I love it, you can control the volume and the speed of the reader."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I did have this app and have since deleted it AS MUCH AS I CAN.It seems it will not delete fully and I am . frankly, sick of trying all ways to GET RID OF IT!I deleted from apps.I deleted from cloud.I deleted it from manage your kindle.I deleted it from the apps in my kindle fire hd 7 inch (the settings sections) and it still shows as taking up over 8 MB of my kindle space.I wish to remove it please.It seems then that this app is invasive in some way and my extra app uninstaller and my virus/malware protection devices do not help either.I really would like to award this no stars at all with all the trouble it has caused AND CONTINUES TO BE WITH ME despite my best efforts."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "My only complaint is that this won't play audiobooks I don't get from Audible, but since it doesn't say it will I can't fault it for not having that feature. I love that I can change the speed of the book I'm listening to and skip between channels, the latter being something I can't do on my current player unless the files are split into chapters (the former I couldn't do until I bought an add-on). Otherwise, this is a clean and easy to use app that I've really enjoyed and has worked flawlessly on my Galaxy S3."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like that I can do others stuff while listening to a book. Great app very intuitive, stop and pick up where you left off. I have not tried the listen to and then switch over to reading in the kindle app where you left off listening in the audible app, but I believe since they are sister apps why would they not work flawlessly? I like some of the books offered in the audible selection, there is enough audible books to keep my attention. I like that they offer daily specials at deep discounts!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this App after signing up with Audible for a monthly subscription for my Kindle Fire HDX. I purchased 2 Audible versions of books I own so wanted to be able to also listen using my cell phone (Android) when I don't have my Kindle. I downloaded this APP, signed in to my account and got an error message &#34;Password Error&#34; over and over again - 4 separate times, removing the App, then reinstalling it, retyping email address and password, repeatedly.... Ugh! So, I  decided to use the Online Technical Support Chat option to find out what was going on. I then get somebody who's even more ignorant than myself so, in my opinion, this App has been a huge waste of time. Sure hope Audible's products are okay with my Kindle because I sure can't use it for my cell. If this is how Audible performs, I will be quickly cancelling my account."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "When this app became available for Android I gave away my iPod nano. It is unbelievably convenient to download books directly whenever you want them! No mucking with awful iTunes.  I've been with Audible for nearly ten years now and this app is far and away the best listening experience I've ever used with the service.Audible itself is wonderful. You can read in so many places it's impossible to take a book. A good book makes your workout or commute fly by! It's a little weird at first--having books read to you--but if you stick with it, you'll quickly come to love Audible too."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "So the only time I ever use this app is if a friend is talking about an item they can't find. I always pull out my phone and see if Amazon has it and then tell them to get it on Amazon. I have made a couple of one click purchases on it in an emergency but otherwise I never use this.I pull Amazon up on my browser because this app really only has 2 functions: search for items, one-click. I can't view my orders, my account, track packages, or anything like that.I would just like to have more options that what is provided. Also, the layout is very difficult to navigate. I mean, if you are a loyal Amazon fan like me I'd download it just to have it but don't expect to use it much.99% of the time I just pull Amazon up on my phones browser since the app is so useless."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Unlike most other apps that only want a few hundred dollars to keep the game up-to-date, this app is like staring down into the main intake of the money shredder of the US Mint.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I have had the PRO version about six weeks. It delivers great adjustable Audio, A Favorite button, add from a huge list. All I had hoped for and more. A tap of the screen takes me instantly from full coverage of Chicago to areas of New York City to A County S.O. in Texas. If you live with anyone, use headphones and enjoy listening to calls about true crimes, true breathless chases after the bad guys, and the satisfaction of \"In custody.\" Crime may not pay but this APP pays off big time. Where is a cop when you need one...Right here!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "It's a very good scanner program and is very easy to use and understand and works great on my Kindle Fire HD. I only have one disappointment about it. I live out in the country and about 40 miles or so from our County Sheriffs Office and the county I live in is not listed. So, I have to set it for the large city that's about 30 miles away and not in the County in which I live. We have no local Police Department and our local volenteer volunteer fire department is not listed in it either."}

Not only that it will scan police and emergency services where ever you are. just go to the browse menu and browse for service where ever you happen to be.

{"label": 1, "raw": "As many have said, this follows a very similar premise to the classic. Pac-Man. The controls are very simple and easy to use, and I like that it's not a joystick like other games. I move off joysticks and lose control, having a control point to touch around is very nice.The 'calibration' (moving the control point) is supposed to be long-pressing the control point for 3 seconds, but for me it seemed more like 5-6 seconds.The messages do pop-up quite frequently, so turning them off is a must (haven't done it yet, but noticed a review said you could). A better option would be text popping up along the top, not a box pausing the game every 5 seconds.Great game, love it, love the new control point control scheme, far easier to use than virtual joysticks."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "playing on a kindle - game works great! no problems with controls and I usually have trouble with them. you can move the control stick to wherever you like so it is comfortable for you. I have not played all levels yet but enjoyed what I have played. the breakaway talking is a bit much but can be turned off - radiant had the same chatter and I am used to it. (I got that one from the faotd awhile ago)  this game is definitely worth a try and is amusing!! if you like arcade type games from the eighties you will probably enjoy this."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Anyone who doesn't give this game a proper chance and passes it off as a pac-man ripoff is sorely missing out.  It has action, puzzle-solving, stealth, and humor.  It requires quick thinking and reflexes, tests your wits under pressure, and is a whole heck of a lot of fun to play.  The simplistic graphics are crisp and vibrant.  The controls, while not perfect, get the job done.  I did have a bit of trouble during the last couple of levels where pinpoint accuracy is required to successfully evade the onslaught of red blocks, but this was far from detracting enough to keep me from loving it.  I never expected to like this game so much, but it turned out to be a real treat."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "We need more games with this much style. I absolutely love the retro look with the hard-edged, pixelated characters but with the added blooming it knocks it out of the park. It doesn't hurt, of course, that the game itself is fun to play. It's like a cross between Pac-Man and its knock-offs (Lock 'n' Chase comes to mind).If anyone is annoyed with the touch screen controls, you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard and use either its directional arrow keys or the WASD keys to control the character.  :D"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is like a new, modern version of Pac-man, just without turning the ghosts blue. The game is a little more maze-like than Pac-Man and you have to think sometimes in order to solve certain puzzles. The graphics are decent but the sound got annoying in a hurry. Make sure to turn off that music! I did find this challenging enough to want to keep playing for a while.While it is pretty fun, but I found myself frustrated with the controls as I would try to be going a certain direction but my finger had slid too far away from the control area and I would stop moving altogether. Or fitting in some tighter spots can be a little difficult. I did get better with practice, but I kept getting frustrated by them."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game tries really hard to be a new spin on pac man, only thing is, pac man did it better and is still going strong after 30ish years. The graphics are mediocre. The controls aren't great. But if you like pac man style games, you may like this, even though it pales compared to the original, and even some good knock offs I've tried. Installed it twice because I really wanted to like it and give it a 2nd chance. But I know I'll never pay it, so I uninstalled it for good."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Ok I tried this. Instructions are simple, and plain, but when I tried to move around, it was awkward. Something that will take a few tries. First try, didn't get caught, so I guess I did something right. I give it 4 stars, because its not a top notch game yet. I may Change it as the game continues, when I have time to continue.  Overall, its cute and interesting.Reading reviews of others...just be honest of your gaming experience.  Others may rely on your comment before downloading. And who uses &quot;twit&quot; anymore?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was a big fan of their other game, Radiant HD, so I was expecting another great one here. Although this isn't my typical genre of game, the premise is promising. Unfortunately, the game is ruined by a tiny control pad in order to navigate around. Yes, you can move the joystick location by holding down it down, but my issue is with the size of it. It is simply just too small, so you're constantly pressing on the wrong direction or area. Fix this minor problem and this game would get five stars from me!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I rarely review apps, but had to on this. I get a little tired of everyone complaining about permissions all the time. If you want games on your phone, that's the name of the game. Some of the most fun games I have, are loaded with invasive permissions. I am not doing this to balance dev reviews, although I believe that is a shady practice by devs. This is an honest review. This game blows. Not even hd graphics like it suggests. Pac man is 2.99, go with that. I installed to see for myself, often reviews are inaccurate. I played the first level, and uninstalled before I got the email from amazon. Not worth the space it takes up."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "this game is way better than pac-man because it has more things you can do then pac-man. I wont give any of the secrets away, but u can move stuff and trigger things and even get shockers that make the red squares(bad guys) freeze for a bit...( kind of like pac-man). There is only one thing I would change and that would be the controls. idk how I would improve them,but now they are abut hard and ive died a few times because of them. but besides that, this game is awesome!! #waybetterthanpac-man(;"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really enjoyed this at first, but eventually the non-intuitive and clunky controls made it impossible to move blocks or escape the red guys at a fast enough  pace.Another annoying thing was the messages from the evil guy would interrupt the game and put a modal dialog box on top of the screen which obscured the maze. You'd have to click to dismiss it and meanwhile you were interrupted in the middle of escaping from the red guys, and when the box went away you'd have to quickly figure out where you are and what you were doing. I lost a lot of life points because of this. They should have the boss's taunts appear in an area separate from the maze so it doesn't interrupt the game.Otherwise the game was fun, and the power-ups were a nice addition to Pac-man."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Pros:1) Is fairly feature-rich2) Has an associated thesaurus2) Not much elseCons:1) Larger than advertised - installs at 6.18MB, NOT 3.12.2) Requires an internet connection (to support the ad bars along the bottom - why else not have the word list and definitions on the device instead on lookup).3) Fairly large memory footprint. Not a problem for more modern devices or those with memory to spare but smaller or slower units will suffer.Overall, not that terrible if you don't mind the ads and the forced internet connection (both of which I despise), but might require that you watch the memory usage."}

Sometimes when typing in a word, it will display a drop-down menu with a list of possible words. My word will be in the list and I will click on it, but at least a third of the time, it doesn't know the word. How can the word be in your drop-down list, but you don't have a definition for it?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "i am a creator who relies on writing for much of what i do. when i copped my Kindle Fire i immediately went to the dictionary that came w/it. while it is an excellent dictionary IMHO, it is not the most intuitive when it comes to looking up words. i've been using the Dictionary.com site for a few years now, so i started using it through the web browser. since navigating sites w/mobile devices can be tedious at times i installed this app when i found out it existed. it does exactly what i need it to do. when i get some loot i'll likely cop the ad-free version.i highly recommend this app if words are important to what you do."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is one of my most used apps.  I seem to manage to have to look up at least a word a day and this little app makes it easy.The best part about this program is it automatically try's to fix your spelling of a word.  To me, that is so refreshing because chances are, if I am looking up a word, I don't know how to spell it!Just realize that you need to be connected to the internet to get to the data.  Good luck!"}

It's great for weather you need a long, detailed, complicated definition using the dictionary, or if you need the thesaurus half of it for short definitions, synonyms, and antonyms, they've got it, which is great and helpful. Also, above all, it speaks the word, how great is that? So no problem if you don't know what an upsidedown a means or what an a and an e put together mean: &AElig;.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I think it's a very competently designed app, which would be invaluable if I didn't already have a good web browser and access to Dictionary.com's webpage.  While it does have a few features, not available on the website, none seem necessary to me.  As such, I feel it's a very good app, but not a good match for my personal needs - I've since uninstalled it, to free up resources.  However, for many other folks, it might indeed be very worthwhile."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I installed this Solitaire Game on my Kindle Fire HD as a second game as I noticed the original Solitaire Game will sometimes hang up after playing the game more than 10 to 12 times before the game is won.  I haven't noticed any problems with this game, but I noticed this version is easier to win than the original game I installed.  Both games are good, I have noticed that numerous Apps that are listed as free for either games or other things are just as good if not better than the one that one has to pay to get.  Would recommend any of the Solitaire Games with 4 to 5 Star Rating that are free for the Kindle Fire HD."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Great Graphics and lots of options for display and play settings make this one a keeper.  Most other Solitaire apps are either very low graphic quality or paid app with too much excess stuff included.  This nice app has ads but they are on left side of screen where they do not bother at all on my Xoom tablet.  I got this app to replace a Solitaire App by &quot;Mobility&quot; that has now added some OBJECTIONABLE ADS for Dating sites, etc.  Luckily I found that  ODESYS has done a nice job with this app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The game is good but there is nothing new in this version of the game... I have played many different versions of this game for PC, and Android.. Almost all are identical .. the only thing the really changes is the graphics from game to game and the design. but the play is the same and the rules are the same as well. Fun and challenging game to kill some time. Not a game I would keep on my Tablet for to long only cuz it only has 112 levels and in a matter of 2 minutes I beat the first 10 already.. seems too easy but it's still a time killer. Fun game for kids to play to keep the distracted. 4 stars for the game only cuz it lacks change that sets it apart from the rest."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "If you've played one version of this type of game, you've pretty much played them all. There's nothing uniquely special about this version (other than the price - I was able to pick it up when it was the free app of the day). It's your standard block moving game... rearrange the blocks to clear the puzzle and move onto the next. A great little game to pick up and tinker with for short periods of time while waiting for the train, bus, at the doctor's office, etc. This one is exactly what I expected it to be."}

It was a good game, I think I lost interest mainly because it was the same ole thing over and over again, just a little more challenging than the previous round...  It can keep me busy while I wait in line or at the doctors office though. :)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Music was good though repetitive.  Scoring seemed off in that a single move would sometimes count as more than one.  There really needs to be a reset button you do not have to dig through menus to find.  Also the reset button does not work right if you have finished the level.  It puts all the bricks back but does not return the red brick.  Finally the controls seem to be off because when I drag a block all the way across the field, i find i have run out of screen before I get the block half way across which means more moves since i have to lift my finger."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Overall, I would just rate this game as \"ok\" and not something I am going to keep on my Kindle Fire - the puzzles can be challenging here and there, but it's really one of those mind-numbing things where you move a few Tetris-looking shapes around trying to get a certain shape into a certain area of the grid.The menu structure for this game is fairly non-existent once you start play.  If you are in the middle of the \"novice\" section as an example, and would like to move to a different challenging level, nothing really happens if you tap the \"Menu\" item on my 8.9\" Kindle Fire.I picked this up for free as the free app of the day vs. it's normal price of $0.99 - for free, it's worth a shot, but save your buck once they start charging for it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really like the app. This slide puzzle modifies to play in both angels on your fire it also has soothing music that you can turn off however if it annoys you. There are no penelties for going over the given moves to solve which allows you to try more puzzles.  It doesn't hold you back do my 6 yr old is happy after move 100 when he finally solves the harder ones but to be honest this only held his attention for three plays. I don't see myself playing it often but it is a nice game for those who enjoy these and to me was calming.Florida Mom"}

Ultra convenient.Plus, the passwords are encrypted multiple times (as many times as you specify), and the password file just saves on your SD card - if your phone kills over, you still have your passwords on your card.Finally, the organization is simple and easy to use: make categories and group the types of data together.GET THIS APP!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Hangman works great, exactly as you'd expect. Runs smooth on Samsung Epic. I haven't seen any repeat words yet, so the dictionary it selects from must be a decent size. Interface is easy to use. Never have to worry about hitting the wrong button. All the letters are big enough to touch, but small enough so they don't crowd too much of the screen. There's a two player mode, too.Shorter words are often extremely difficult. I've been dealt a large quantity of three-letter words and even a couple of two-letter words. When you only have a handful of chances, they're a bit tough to solve, since you can't piece together much from the surrounding letters. An option to limit how short words can be would be nice.Overall, if you want to play hangman on your Android phone, this will do that very well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "There were some really hard words on the easy mode, so I can't imagine what words they have on the hard mode. I wish it could give you some clues, at least. It's annoying how in like six missed letters, you loose. One time I played alone and got 3-28. I was getting owned by my own Kindle Fire! This app is certainly not for kids because it's too hard. The time might come when you stop trying and you're just pressing random letters... Very annoying."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a good game. It is nice to be able to play the game against the computer, because then you don't have to admit to anyone else that you like to play hangman. ;)However, I HATE the font. It's hard to read some of the letters. For example, the \"O\" looks like a diamond that has been hollowed out, and it has four sides. I suppose it is supposed to look like someone chiseled the words out of a rock tablet, but it doesn't, and it's just annoying. When you're using letters to guess a missing word, and you have to keep remembering what the letter you're looking at represents, that's a drawback. With a better font, this game would have rated five stars."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is hard.And its always acting up.If y'all like like this y'all crazy! Like this one time I put in the right answer and it put in a really bad word so I called the people that owened the game and they said they ment to do that so I said this is a bad game they said don't talk to me like that they said a cusing. word thetheman said I know where you live I said I'm going to call the police ok he said. a bad word THAT'S. MY REVIEW YALL!!!!!!!!! DON'T FALL FOR IT YALL!!!!!!$$$$$$ LOVE NUMBER 7"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is really good. I love it but the only downside is that when you play single player your playing with the computer and the computer gives you words that you don't even know. Like krill like seriously 5 years old play this there not going to know what that is. And the computer  is hard to beat it like wins every time. I highly recommend this game to people who love hangman and want their kids to enjoy. But if you let your child use this game don't let them play single it's t ok hard. Play with them and go easy on them their little. Really get thus game it's so fun!!!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Great as a solitaire.  Only problem is trying to keep a continuous score.  You cannot press ok and then leave the game.  Just leave the game.  When you come back your score will be there.  If you press okay.  The next time you play the game will be set at zero.  Was able to get it up to 1000 wins, but don't know if that's all you can go, or if I pressed ok by mistake.  Trying again."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have used this product on my computer for many years, but are the values the true value or deflated values.  It seems with the real estate downfall, no one knows the true value of their home these days.  And if you are trying to buy or sell, people go to Zillow to see what they value the property.  I think we should go back to what appraisers think the property is worth, because realtors do not know any more.  They and the banks are the ones who got us into this trouble, only my opinion."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this app.  I use it on my home computer all the time.  Every real estate agent says NO NO NO  don't use this let me get your info, but in my experience this gives me comps, five years worth of taxes and graphs to show what the house and surroundings are doing, past and present sales.  Also what the list prices on the houses and what Zillow thinks they are should be selling for.  Most times the houses sell closer to Zillow estimates that what they agents listed the houses for. Great App"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "if I could best believe I would give zero stars! why you ask!? because I was able to open this once. one time. the first time. after that it force closes before the app fully opens!

I even prayed that this here would open. nothing nothing NOTHING!!!!!FIX THIS CRAP AND I WILL GIVE BETTER RATING.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I've used Zillow on an iPad and loved it, and I was very happy to see it in the Amazon Android app store. It installed and runs fine on my Kindle Fire. I'm not planning to move anytime soon, so I don't really NEED Zillow, but it's one of the most interesting apps I've seen, so I WANT it. Let's face it, it's fun to look up friends' and relatives' homes and see what they're worth. Call it anonymous snooping!Zillow keeps getting better and better, with its filters, graphs of value over the years, and actual photos of many houses. The Kindle Fire has a big enough screen size that it's easy to view properties from a Google Earth view on one side and a Charts and Data view on the other side.A very useful app and one that could be extremely valuable for anyone planning to buy or sell a property."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a really cool app that is map based. If you have your GPS signal on your device on it quickly shows what's available around you. Don't worry you can look up any area just by searching for it. I like this app because you can customize your search to only show the places you want to see. For an example you can set it to have a house built in the 2000s that is at least 1,500 sq ft that's less than $500,000. You can look at pictures of the place if they are any posted. You can make the pictures full screen or simply keep it small to quickly look through them. You can sign up to actually have an account or connect with Facebook as well to save favorites or to share with family and friends. I haven't had any problems with this app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app runs smoothly and allows me to find properies via a map then click on each for more details. The down side is not all properties for sale in the area are on the app. I have found others by going to the different reealtor's websites that did not show up on the app. However - most are there and so I think it is well worth it. I am currently looking at another state, but I think when I get to the point of actually driving around to the properties it will be more usueful. I'd say - if you are looking to buy - this app is for you!"}

Also, recent sale $ of property in my neighborhood is incorrect!?  Can't use this app since it's not reliable."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have been a subscriber to Zillow's web site for almost 2 years. This application does much more than what I was ever able to do on my phone. I have had great success in saving my searches for specific properties as well as searching for specific locations. This is a tool that I would rate as a must have for someone wanting to relocate, research, or invest in property. I would strongly recommend this application! I have not once been disappointed in my research using the Zillow app on my Kindle Fire."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm appalled at the level of ignorance and vitriol in these reviews. How can this app steal contact data when it doesn't have network permission? Access to contact data is required to add birthdays, anniversaries, or appointments. It's a shame that ignorance and anger is leading to fewer developers submitting good apps for FAotD. Amazon app reviews are rife with ignorant trolls who have inflated egos, an unwarranted sense of entitlement, and who aren't half as smart as their smart-phones.This app works great for its intended purpose. It's a handy adjunct to my Google Calendar."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "A great app for storing your passwords securely. Available for Android, PC, Mac, and iOS - though it isn't cheap and it really doesn't need to be expensive for what you get. I am a software developer and have worked with encryption quite a bit myself. The work that went into this app doesn't warrant charging 10 bucks for every platform you use it on. I wish they had a buy it once and use it anywhere policy as at 10 bucks, that would be more than fair."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Okay, well I suppose this app would be okay (actually it would probably be my favorite password manager) if it weren't for the fact that it let's the leeboard remember EVERYTHING you type in. For example, I decided to try it & the first thing I did was put in a login/password combo. Well, when I entered my password, it didn't show a blank suggestion bar on my keyboard. It showed my whole password right there for my phone to remember! (Yikes!!) So I haven't used itsince, because I don't trust it to keep my passwords safe."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Yesterday, I upgraded my Evo to Gingerbread. After the update, the password manager that I was using wouldn't even open. I was perturbed. This morning I checked the Amazon free app of the day, and saw this. I downloaded it, and am in the process of retreiving all of my passwords one by one to enter in to this app.This app has many customizable categories, many of which I will never use. So, I just delete the entire category. This app is EXTREMELY customizable.I really don't see what there is to dislike about this very useful app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The password generator is nice, especially with the options it gives.It really needs a bit better up-front documentation on the way it works as far as locking and such.My biggest concern is the permissions. I am fairly sure it's safe, and I understand why it is asking for them, but I cannot condone using any app which holds sensitive data to request any permission allowing network access and things which 'could' be used maliciously.Cool features, but not going to use anything but the generator."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "Works great on samsung vibrant, no problems with the 2.1 platform.However, this us a straight up maze game. While you may think to yourself that this has a maze section in it and that precludes all other sections from being mazes, that simply isn't the case. They are all mazes. Some mazes are a mine field of holes you have to negotiate around. Some mazes have multiple trickery objectives you can't access. Some mazes have plausible almost solutions. Don't be fooled! There is only one solution to each of these maps.If you are not good at judging the difference between one small gap and another, this is not the game for you. If you hate having to back out to start over because the ball is such in a made trap, this game is not for you. If you have hands that are in any way unsteady when you get nervous/angry/frustrated, this game will be hard for you."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've played a few labyrinth type games and this one of the better ones.  The 3D is a little misleading because 3D cell phones are coming out and this does not take advantage of that feature.  It is only 3D in that it moves around several dimensions and isn't flat.The game is pretty responsive and I didn't notice any lag.  The challenges are some of the better ones I've seen.  This was actually a lot more fun than other Labyrinth games I've played and it kept my interest far longer."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was glad to see this game offered for free on Amazon. I had the free version, ad supported, and ended up uninstalling it. The ads were just way to annoying trying to play, other than that I loved this game. It's very challenging, and forcing you to focus on eye-hand control. It does get frustrating as you move up through the levels, but not enough that it isn't addicting. If you like puzzle games this is a fun game! Also works great on my HTC Evo 3g."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "A very useful app that allows you to track all of your accounts, set a budget, remind you when bills are due, even do transfers between accounts. It makes you keep actively aware of your finances.It is not connected to any accounts so you do have to keep your records as frequently as you do you check book. The app makes you accountable for your money giving you all the tools to keep an accurate accounting but it will not do it for you. If you forget or don't keep up with your spending it will fail you and frustrate you, but if you keep up with your accounts it will keep you balanced and disciplined. It has made me more accountable for my follies and more disciplined in understanding where my money is going, bad or good."}

Searched again &amp; decided to try a free app this time-Toshl. Really cute, got the job done, but not enough features! Searched again &amp; there it was EasyMoney! Has lots of features &amp; its easy to understand utilize + I got it when it was free! I love it, got rid of the other apps &amp; can now live happily ever after...that is, as soon as I find a publisher for this novel sized review!Thanks for reading:)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a very good app, and they asked me to rate it five stars if I enjoyed it, so, yea. But, I got this app for free, part of amazon's &quot;Paid free app everyday&quot; thing, ( which I find awesome.) Though, it may feel very good for the kindle fire, (because I know that there are some apps that just do not even seem remotely good), have a nice sound of a cash register whenever you put a transaction in, and come ready to go, there are some free apps that can do the exact same thing as this app, maybe even better. $10.00 to be able to track your money? You will be using the app and wondering where the $10.00 went."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "EasyMoney is pretty easy and intuitive and more importantly, it's reliable.  No big bugs to report.  I used to use Splashmoney on my old PalmPilot.  It was great.  I was going to buy the version for the Kindle Fire, but saw more than one really bad review.  So, I looked around and saw that EasyMoney had some pretty good reviews.  Once I finish putting in my budgets, and set up my regular transfers and payments, I think I will find EasyMoney very useful."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this free today, so I figured that I would check it out. In my opinion, it's not worth $10. The layout is beautiful but that's just about all it has. The biggest feature that I would like is to have this sync with my accounts. It's not here. You literally have to enter any/every transaction manually. I think this app would be helpful if I had tons of different accounts and wanted to have everything available quickly in one place, but I don't. Even if I did, I can't see why I would want to manually enter every single transaction into my phone when online banking or viewing statements online is free everywhere. It's easier for me to use Pageonce for my needs. I don't see why anyone would prefer this over any of the free money apps out there. If this app actually synced with my bank accounts automatically, I'd have made a completely different review."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Downloaded this when it was the FAOTD.  I've been using a planner to keep up with the budgets because I don't like programs that require access to my bank account, and because things take forever to clear that way.  I much prefer to keep track manually, so this was perfect for me.  I wish that there were bi-monthly options for payment and budgeting, and I only started actually using it on my Kindle Fire for a couple of days, but so far, bug-free and very handy!  The only other issue... $10 is a little high.  I never would have tried it if it weren't free."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Now that I'm officially retired, I need to get serious about budgeting.  This is billed as 'easy',  but there are no instructions and I'm a babe in the woods with this stuff.  I never could put a budget together - only create categories but found no way to put a $ figure in.  Where I accidently did (how??) I could not put in cents.Now I have to figure out a way to return it and get my $10 back.Not easy at all.  Needs a help or how-to option."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have been doing this kind of cash flow monitoring in excel for many years and have finally found a good replacement with this app.  I like the future recurring transactions capability the best so I can forecast my cash flow multiple months at a time.  I would give this app the full 5 stars but the backup and export features cause the app to force close.  this is very unfortunate as I purposefully bought the app with these features in mind.  oh well.  it still rates high for me anyway.  htc incredible."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Nice Radio but watch the Radio settings.I installed it on my new Kindle Fire. It ran great until the station was changing because it was in shake mode. Please do yourself a favor and change the Apps settings so that it does not do shake mode for changing the stations. This setting stays on even after the app is shut off or removed. It will interfere with the running of the Kindle Fire. Any movement of the Fire will reset the screen, and apps. Books will not open. Hard reset will not work. Device settings will open but will not correct the problem unless you remove everything by resetting to factory defaults.I reinstalled it and it seems to work again.Other than that. Its a likeable App."}

It was a breeze to setup the BBC radio stations and i am loving how will integrated it is to the Amazon Fire experience.The favourites section is just great and the radio discovery piece again, beautiful.  Nice touch where it detects where roughly you are in the world (based i assume on IP) and offers you the local stations.The UI is clean and sharp and listening to a radio station while using other software on the device proves no difficultly.  Sadly on the Amazon Fire, if you are listening via the browser, as soon as you move focus away from that tab, or the device blanks the screen, the radio stops.This software is the missing link ... and best of all its free."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was very pleased with this app. I have an Internet radio and it occurred to me that there should be an app for Internet radio and I found this one and gave it a shot. I was especially pleased to find the police and fire radios on it. That's a nice bonus if you hear sirens and wonder what's going on. In a matter of seconds I can have the local emergency radio channels on and be listening to what's going on. It's been a very good little app for me. I like it a lot."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "I SAW an earlier review where someone was humorously mocking indulging in old technology (although he enjoyed the app just the same), but I live where there is only one radio station and it isn't very good.  And you don't know how wonderful radio is until you don't have it anymore.  And the sound quality is good (I set the buffer to about 25 seconds) and the quality is really good and the selection of stations is wonderful--just wonderful.  I highly recommend this app to anyone. Also, I tried the alarm feature this morning and it worked great."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was thrilled to stumble on this app with so many to choose from out there.  Great selection of stations, but users need to understand that many of the stations aren't broadcasting 24hr/7days/week.  For example, I was able to listen to the Green Bay Packers game on tunein today, but that station is only available as a live broadcast unless you buy the pro version which I understand to be buggy and/or limited with regard to recording and playback options.  However, there are many live radio stations, both local and from around the world that are available all the time.  I'm so impressed with the free version that I couldn't ask for more.  I do recommend it highly."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I don't write many app reviews ... because most range from useless to \"eh\". TuneIn Radio, however, is incredibly useful and amazingly fun!

{"label": 1, "raw": "This is the first app I have tried from the Amazon App store, and as it turned out, this was a good place to start. It works amazingly well on my HTC Inspire 4G, and it is not complicated to learn to maneuver through it and find what you want to hear. There are so many good choices for listening. I was a little disappointed to find out that my two local hometown stations aren't there, but then a message in the app told me that they have not been made available for streaming."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Easy to work within, good selection of stations. makes it easy to find music you are in the mood to listen to. I like being able to have favorite stations and also recent station for reference. You can also listen to news,  events, just search and you will find something to enjoy. I have this on my phone to listen with earplugs outdoors while gardening as a change from my iPod. I used to live on the other coast so it is fun for me to listen to stations from that area but there are also stations around the world as well better than a previous app and much better than iHeart radio app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I found this app on Amazon and thought it would be great to have on my 7\" android tablet. The selection of music is fantastic and I love the fact that I can just relax and listen to the radio or do other things on my tablet while I listen to my favorite music. I like the fact that you can preset your favorite stations so there is no searching around trying to find them again. The variety of radio stations is really good ... there is something for everyone! If you like to listen to the radio, this is the app for you!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "There are lots of glowing reviews for the good things this software does, so I will post the main reason for my three star review:The TuneIn Radio software does not shut down properly.Regardless of whether I click the \"back\" button on my Droid Charge (which ends most applications), or press Exit in the TuneIn Radio menu, the program remains running in the background, consuming precious battery power. I am forced to fire up a task manager to kill the application.The other incredibly frustrating issue with the program is that, even after I have used a task manager to forcefully kill the app., the app. occasionally restarts itself in the background.Fix those two issues and it's a five star application."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I give this app 5 stars because it runs very well on my Kindle fire.  One a full charge and running for 6+ hours, along with game apps, the battery does not wear down.  I was easily able to find the station I was after, something with country classics.  While not everyone's cup of tea, the 1 radio station I could receive at my job was stale with 'new' country.  Sound is crisp and clear and I rarely lose connection with the station.  I can listen to whatever I like, now, no limits on my location, I can even receive stations in another country!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Great app for anyone who like to listen to the radio,internet radio streams and podcasts.The controls are really simple and it has a feature that gives you other stations like the one you are listening do.Uses very little battery power so it is something you can use for many hours at a time.If you pay for XM/Sirius and can live without a couple of so called \"radio stars\" you will drop you service as soon as you get this.Hook up a blue tooth to your car or FM tramsmiter though your headphone jack and listen to this in your car.Alot of stations to choose from, quite awesome as everyone says.Some stations do have low bit rate but that is the stations decision not tuneins."}

The free version has ads and the paid version does not but I like the ads, it's the American way!Sorry to say after listening to the free version, every time it changed ads there was much digital sputtering, making it unlistenable.Reminds me of the old dial-up days. The ads change a lot and if the ads blinked on and off, Whoa, Nelly! This is the first time I've had problems with Tune-In. I love it on my phone and Nook reader, so I went ahead and bought the paid  version, and what do you know....it's perfect!"}

I replaced Slacker Radio and Scanner Radio with TuneIn as it does everything that both apps do better, and without any of the artificial limitations placed on most free apps. It certainly encouraged me to purchase the paid version. There is also no intrusive / annoying advertising.Pros:-- Wide selection of Radio stations, emergency bands, online streams, etc.-- No annoying advertising.-- No features advocating the paid version (features not available in the free version are taken out, and don't get in your way or pop up asking you to upgrade).-- UI is well done, and always keeps the currently playing station handy at the bottom so you can stop and start it quickly.Cons:-- None that I can honestly list as cons. It would be nice to be able to record radio, however, as this is in the paid version I can't honestly list it as a con."}

I live VERY rurally and can literally only get one or two country music stations on a radio - NOT something I would ever wish to listen to.  In my car, the radio reception is not a lot better.  I particularly enjoy talk radio and this app gives it to me in an abundance I had never imagined would be possible where I live.  Sound quality (with and without my cheap earphones) is perfect and it's no exaggeration to say that this app has changed my life."}

Most of the time the app does not seem to register taps on the menus (Tested on Kindle Fire)The game gets very challenging with lots of holes where the balls slides thru' Please make provisions for the ball to re-emerge somewhere else rather than starting from scratch it will make this app even more engaging and challenging.Please make some boards with different background colors as it might get more interesting to play rather than seeing the same color board every-time.Thanks for reading my comments."}

It's very touch responsive on Kindle Fire, and Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I played only a few level and enjoyed the game play so far. It's simple, and cute. Not too many buttons to press. The planes that has higher speed, makes me dizzy. It spins so fast, and moves so fast. I prefer the slower planes.  My 2 years old son love to crash the plane. Definitely worth 2.99 but I got it as free app of the day."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a fun game. You fly your plane by using the joystick type control at the bottom left of the screen and try shooting using the fire button on the bottom right of the screen. Simple controls. You shoot the planes down that show up and the level progresses in difficulty. There are stars that fall from the sky and they have rewards or not. Sometimes it will freeze your enemies or sometimes it makes you fly slowly. Each star has either a benefit or a curse that only lasts a little while. Fun game."}

I still havent beaten the game, but I think I want to unlock all the planes and this is just anperfect time waster.  I can assure you that this is more than worth the purchase price.Good:*Gameplay is simple enough to jump right in, but deep enough that you don't get bored.*Loads of planes to unlock, and each one plays differently combining one of 7 different weapons with varrying levels of turn, speed, and health.*The mix of enemies on each wave is often challenging, sometimes sending you back to previous levels to unlock a better plane.*Multiplayer (haven't personally tried)Bad:*doesm't look like it would work well on a phone*occasionally the controls lock up, but that might just be my tablet."}

I also like the touch popup menu features and like the swiping from left to right allowing me to move from category to category. Which brings me to the reason why I don't give it 5 stars. I have a list category tittled &quot;News&quot;, when I swipe into that page, the tweets do not load, the page remains blank with turning circle in the center indicating that its loading, but never does. The same thing happens when I swipe into my facebook page, it reads &quot;no news items&quot;, I cant get my facebook timeline. I wonder if anyone else is experiencing a similar problem."}

The neatest feature is scanning the barcode of your supplements and foods -it's that easy!The only reason I didn't give it five stars it's because the amazon version is an older version - there it's a newer version on android market.

I like this combination much more than calorific or Noom because it is 100% comprehensive and allows me to keep track of things like sodium and protein consumption as opposed to general gross calorie intake.You really can't go wrong with this!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this app because it helps me lose weight.  It helps me keep tabs on what I eat so that I begin to understand the calories and how my activity level impacts on it. I only use it when I'm determined to lose weight and when I lose it (or don't), I stop. The first time, I lost about 8 lbs after using it for 2 months.  Then, I stopped using it and I go back for a month or so, whenever I want to lose weight.  My weight loss has leveled off since then and I can't make huge losses again.  However, this was very useful especially if you are a huge foodie like I am.  I like eating a mixed bag of international food and you can find the most obscure food on there too and portion out how much of it you actually ate."}

Sure, if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long, but a lot of times you will be beside another car or can't get really close.  Because of this, I would recommend something a little longer than 12'.Great brand - get 16' version though."}

All of them seem to dump tons of dust on my poor car. This model comes with the wood handle. Others out there have a cheap plastic one. Read the directions on the cover. You're suppose to let it air out after shipping. It has something to do with the wax on the brush. It also will tell you not to worry about it getting dirty. In fact its suppose to work better as it gets dirtier. The duster will work even better if you put a sealant and/or wax on your car. You'll find that you can pull a lot more material off your car. The duster will easily remove pollen, dust, and any other light coating of material. It will remove the dust from hard water and rain deposits, but you'll still see the marks if you look carefully. Buy this product. You're call will thank you!"}

I will NOT make a filthy car that hasn't been washed in weeks or months look clean. You must either keep your car in a garage, or use a cover like I do, and dust it daily to keep it looking clean. If I wash, clay bar, and wax my car I can go two months or perhaps more without washing it again, as long as I keep it covered, dust daily, and wipe it down weekly with an instant detailer. The fibers are impregnated with a paraffin wax so don't just lay it on something if you don't want it to be stained because of the wax and dirt. Also, if there is condensation on the car it really renders the duster ineffective so make sure it's dry before using it."}

The magnets aren't strong but - barely strong enough to hold on the ceiling.There's nothing good to look at with this deflector.  It kind of disappears since it's transparent plastic.If this will fit your vent, just get one.  See how you like it and you can order more later."}

I wasted a lot of money prior to purchasing these unbreakable ones with the other type that don't flex and that break easily. The magnets are very strong, when I lift these up for cleaning, I pull the entire metal register out of the floor. The magnets are strong enough to hold tight on registers that have several coats of paint on them, too."}

The only way is to drill a hole thru one of the other two holes and thru the mount.  This takes the simplicity out of using this cable lock, obviously.  But if you're willing to do this, it just takes a few extra minutes and then the lock works great on it.  I'll probably also add a locking lug nut to mine for added theft deterrence.  A cable lock isn't foolproof but it gives you another level and at this price why not?"}

It's metal, strong, rust-resistance (it's not a grade of rust-proof stainless as there are already spots from road-salt), but given the narrow space where it fits, it's difficult to get the locking end on and off.  It's hard to get a good grip on it,  even with the knurling on the ends.  But the ends ARE small enough so there's no interference with other hardware.  The hitch on my truck is just wide enough outside that there's almost to end-play on the lock shaft which makes getting the end on even more difficult.  Takes some getting used to.  I don't think there's a better product out there though, which makes this worth the price."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I really appreciate the Rain X in a light drizzle or mist, when the water seems to disperse by itself with minimal windshield wiper use. When you apply before the cold weather, though, it helps prevent ice from sticking to your windshield, which is just great. I also like to use the product on the back window, which doesn't have a wiper, because it keeps the window clearer. Follow the directions--let it dry to a light haze and wipe it off with a microfiber or paper towel until the windshield is clear. I'm sure you'll like it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Before I applied this to the windshield of my car, I noticed that the wiper blades, although new, left some streaking on the glass, and it could be a bit of a challenge to see outside especially when it rains hard and the raindrops magnify the lights of cars or the streetlights. After application, the wiper blades no longer left streaks, it became much easier to clearly see outside and the water beaded and blew away. At times, it may look like there is no rain on the glass when driving through rain at night.It works so well that I purchased another bottle when my first one began to run out."}

It also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. Two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1) It should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2) The diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size - would allow faster filling."}

This is a solid heavy duty device and is no toy. I mounted it securely under the hood next to the battery itself and have a heavy duty plug hanging down -- just behind the front bumper -- to connect up while out in the driveway. The lights/indicators on this model are very nice and it keeps my battery at full strength. If you have two vehicles (or more) and you don't drive one of them that often -- definitely get one of these. You will never have another \"oh no\" moment -- when turning that key in the morning.

{"label": 2, "raw": "I was looking for a new chamois to replace the old worn out one I had.  I ran across the Absorber, and the reviews wore great on this product.  So, I decided to give it a try.  I'm SO glad I bought it!! It really is the best chamois/absorbent drying towel I've ever seen!! After drying your car (or whatever you are trying to dry off), just toss it in your washing machine. It comes out looking brand new again!!  You really can go wrong---buy this product!!!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I find it a bit humorous that reviewers keep saying &#34;it doesn't absorb water&#34;.. then they state later on that they have to ring all of the water out all of the time. Are they ringing out &#34;air&#34; ? Of course is absorbs the water. It is just not good at drying the car for the final wipe. I use a towel after using this. That's worked well for many years. I tried a &#34;waffle towel&#34; and it was worse than the absorber. I tried a special auto towel, but that did not work as well either. I think that the absorber used with a towel is probably the best combo to use. I suppose you can turn on the leaf blower, but if you get any dirt in there you may do a number on your paint."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "There are a few things to know about the absorber to get the most out of them.  First, before using, soak in warm water, this makes it more absorbent.  Second, keep it clean.  The wort thing you could do is have a dirty chamois and drag it across your paint, this will introduce maring of your clear coat.  I wash it on gentle cycle with a little distilled vinegar then air dry.  When storing, get it as dry as possible.  Ive had them get moldy in the container from being too damp."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "For those of you who are wondering \"do I have to keep the tube forever?\", the answer is \"no\".  I threw my tube away the first week I had it and three years later it still performs like a champ.  The chamois will dry out and become hard if left exposed, but once you wet it again, it becomes as absorbent and pliable as new.The other reviews are correct.  This thing holds an astounding amount of water for its size and weight and is excellent at streak free drying of automotive surfaces.  Once saturated with water, it wrings out very easily and it ready to pick more back up.  After three years mine has held up very well, though it is a bit discolored from the dirt it has picked up from my car over time.This is the only drying chamois most people will ever need."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this based on the recommendation of a friend. It works well, and if you are very certain your freshly washed car is free from all debris, you will likely not cause any scratching. However, if you pick up some rogue sand granule or some other debris, you could cause clear coat damage.After watching an episode of Drive Clean and seeing them use microfiber towels in the same manner, I made the switch. It takes a little longer, but the microfiber towel is marginally safer on your precious paint job and if you're auto obsessed, it may be worth the extra time. The microfiber are also easier to clean, just wash and dry and you are on your way. This thing will get mold unless you let it dry out completely and is a pain to wash by hand. I still use it around the house and it works well, it just no longer gets anywhere near my new car."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Awesome.  Just used this for the first time earlier today.  I've owned a natural chamois but haven't used it in years so I threw it away.  This works great.  Washed my car and then used a Water Blade on it (def another recommended product) and then used this on all the corners and tight spaces.  Soaks the water up very well, rings out a lot of the water and stores &#34;damp&#34; which means little to not maintenance to maintain.  Covers a lot of area too I was surprised once I unfolded it just how big it was."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this cloth with the intent of drying my car after I have washed it. I have very hard water and when I want my car to look nice I have to dry it or I get little hard water spots all over the place.Drying my car with \"The Absorber\" does solve that problem and it does absorb quite a lot of water. It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in. I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water. But it dries to the point where the residual water evaporates in a minute or so. I consider that pretty good and my goal of not having water spots is met so I'm a happy camper. I would buy another one if I needed it :)"}

If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.

By having some of these travel electric blankets in the car, everyone can keep as warm as they want to.This blanket works just as well as my other one and gets just as warm, just as fast. It works exactly like a household electric blanket does. I was so pleased with how well they worked that I bought some as gifts for people for Christmas this year.

I combined the K&N; air filter with the popular Z-tube mainly because I was already going to be in there so I figured why not just add the Z-tube for a bit more efficiency. at this point, I have no complaints, I do feel a slight increase in power in 2nd and 3rd (not a 100% sure if it's all from the air filter or with the Z-tube), and rev noise has stayed the same."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "First, this filter will NOT give you huge horsepower gains, it might give you minimal MPG gains just by replacing the filter from a dirty, clogged one, but that will come with any filter. I bought this filter because it does save money, money you would be spending buying paper filters over and over again, with this and a 10-15 dollar service kit, this filter will last your vehicles lifetime. There is a trade off though, this filter does not screen out dirt as well as say a \"paper\" or foam type filter, that is why \"off roading\" voids the damage warranty. however i never off road, and for highway and street use, this filter is King in terms of economy and durability (it is made of 4-5 layers of cotton encased with a aluminum wire mesh surrounded by hand poured urethane), they mean it when they say it will last a Million miles. This filter earns my recommendation."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I didn't like this hose nozzle as much as other reviewers.  For the price, I was expecting an amazing nozzle.  It is heavy, sturdy, and looks like it will be very durable, but I do not like the selection of the spray patterns compared to the $5 hose nozzles at home improvement stores.  The rubber areas are comfortable to hang on to.This would be great for washing a car or big jobs like hosing down a pool or screens, but for watering potted plants and trees, this nozzle puts too much water down and creates splashing."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have owned no less than 15 different nozzles over the years. One has been worse than the next. The ones you drop after you use which are made of plastic simply break. Then there are the ones with the several settings and trigger which constrict the flow so much that you would think it needed a dose of flomax! I have used many types in between. This unit is simply the best. I never realized the pressure I had restricted by using the other ones. When I turned the spigot on all the way, I could get a good steady stream over 20 feet no problem at all. I drop it after use without worrying about cracking it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I liked the concept of this, and bought two at the same time. We have small ranch, and varying watering/hosing needs. We typically buy the 7 way adjustable nozzles, but I thought these would allow more versatility.These nozzles perform well, but not as good as a conventional nozzle. For a start, there is no quick way to get the desired spray pattern, you have to slowly rotate the head and stop when you think it is what you need, often messing around 'finely tuning' it to try and get the best result. Secondly, none of the 'jet' part of the adjustments creates a clean jet, there is always a fine mist or errant second or third jet spraying in a different direction at the same time.These cannot create all the spray patterns found on a 7 way nozzle, and create poor patterns on the ones they can create.This is a good idea, but in reality you are better off with a 7 way nozzle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "You are better off going to your local department store and buying the Craftsman brand nozzle instead. It is identical to this one except the green part is silver. And it comes with a lifetime replacement guarantee unlike this Bon-Aire one. It's also about the same price.That said, I prefer a trigger type nozzle because to turn this off, you have to rotate it several revolutions and then it doesn't remember the spray setting you were at. This type of nozzle may be good if you're holding it for a long period of time watering your garden or something like that, but for washing your car when you only turn the water on periodically, it doesn't work as well as a trigger type hose nozzle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It works well, I am surprised that someone else does not make it[cheaper].  It is a very low tech material.  We used it in the doors of a friends car when speakers were replaced and spent over $100.  I bought three cans of rubberized undercoat at Wally-World for about $5 per can and my doors were just as quiet.  I guess it is just personal preference and economic priority, for me the extra $85 in the pocket was better.  My friend, well he spends money like a drunken sailor...not to offend any drunken sailors out there."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this for my 99 ford escort lx sedan, so I could hear my sony stereo more. I followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors. I have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers. I can hear them more and there's less vibration on the doors. As far as road noise goes, it helped just a little. This product isn't made to reduce the road noise, just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road. The road noise level is still the same in my car."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have an FJ Cruiser.  It's not a quiet vehicle.  I accept that.I have been working on upgrading my stereo system - replaced the head unit, put in 6x9 speakers in the doors, etc.  Well, the 6x9s are much more responsive than the stock speakers were, especially in the lower frequencies.  So, I developed a buzz.  I bought the Dynamat to see if I could get rid of that, after I tightened everything that I could find.Installation was easier than I feared - thanks for the tennis ball tip, BTW!  As far as the real results, though, I'm not sure that I've noticed a real difference in sound quality, noise, or heat.  Perhaps some.  The rattling has reduced, but not eliminated.Does the product work?  Possibly.  It's hard for me to say either way."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product is great, I only bought one of the sheets and all you have to do is fill the open holes in you trunk. I only covered the holes on the trunk and on the rear deck lid for the speakers. I didnt notice a big difference while driving till i looked at my rpm gauge and it was at 3500!!!! i usually shift at 2300 rpm and it was soo quiet I did not realize the rpm's i was running!!!! This product dampened my car from the sports exhaust sooooo much!!!! Great if you have a different exhaust system!!! I am amazed on how much this product helps!! I am about to do my bottom of my trunk and my inside firewall and I know my car will almost sound electric from the interior!!! GREAT PRODUCT!!!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've used Dynamat for many years now. In my car I didn't manage to eliminate rattles from the trunk (2x jl audio 13w6's), but greatly reduced them. It used to be embarrassing (and sounded bad too) driving with volume up and car rattling being the only audible thing. It's better now because the rattling can only be heard by the trunk on the outside. I used it in the doors, floors, and trunk of my 04' elantra and it dramatically reduced road noise. It also made the stereo sound 10x better in my car. I also used it in the doors and trunk of an 01 Grand Prix, and also reduced road noise and improved stereo quality, but not as dramatically as my car since the grand prix comes with more sound deadening."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After years of being an idiot and trying to gently use my fingers to prevent my door from scraping on the wall of my car port, I bought this. Works exactly like it should... by being a barrier between my door and the wall. The thickness is perfect. It could stand to be a little longer for my inaccurate parking jobs... but very good nonetheless. Even has two holes cut out so you can drill the sucker into a wall if need be.Note: The vinyl tape that it says is frequently purchased with this product will not work on a textured (stucco) wall."}

Sturdy jack stands, might be slightly high for some cars, depending on what you are trying to do (being too high isn't awful - you just need to jack your car up a little more).Overall, simple no frills car jack stands. Has a safety pin mechanism to to keep the jack stand locked, as well as the regular locking handle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "As for quality, sure it isn't top notch. But this thing isn't going to fall apart on you, these are tough and will hold. Scared for you life? Than go to a shop. The welding isn't perfect, but you have to realize this is mass produced. The welds aren't going to separate. I would definitely suggest using these in pairs, as in don't leave one alone to hold part of your vehicle. For those with cars, don't worry b/c cars weigh nothing. These are rated for as much as a cars avg weight. The double locking is a nice feature but not necessary on small jobs. My truck weighs over 6k so if these can hold one end, it will hold your average cars then too. If your doing small jobs, get these b/c theres no beating the price."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max.

{"label": 2, "raw": "I would not hesitate to recommend these jack stands, as I have had very good results and they seem to be very well made.  The double lock is an absolutely mandatory feature in my estimation.  You should always use the jack stands with the double lock in place, as it adds additional security.  I am pleased with the height of the stands as well, as it is possible to raise the vehicle up a considerable amount, making it easy to get in and work.  I replaced the front suspension on my vehicle in an afternoon using these stands and they never wavered.  I went out and replaced the rear shocks, springs, and fuel filter the next day.  Once again, the stands were steady and solid while I pushed, shoved, wedged, etc. the rear springs into place.I am very pleased with these stands and definitely recommend them."}

A few minutes of one-time configuration/setup is needed and future mount/removals are accomplished in seconds.  The only reason i didn't give these a 5 star rating is the small foam discs tend to come off the mounting bases periodically (they press against the outside of your existing mirror).  Thoughtfully, the vendor includes extras.  All in all, a very unique and functional product!"}

Still I decided to &#34;add&#34; an additional strap that mounted to the two front feet to help hold it tighter at those points just for my own concerns about possible moving at higher speeds on the interstate.  By adding the straps I did realize a more stable fit to the shape of our Highlander mirror.

Now with my periferal vision I notice if there is a reflection change in the mirror, and I will be aware if anyone is approaching my desk."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I started out with the \"kit\" (cleaner & oil) for my K&N.  It just seems that the oil lasted longer than the cleaner, especially if your filters get really dirty and you have to clean a second time.  The 32 oz. may cost as much as the kit, but it also has 4x the amount of cleaner in the spay bottle.  The larger spray bottle has a larger dispersal sprayer than the one in the kit, so it takes less time to spray down your filter."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This 32 ounce is much cheaper in the long run than the kit with it's little bottle of cleaner. Most people use more of the cleaner than the oil. One properly serviced K&N filter will last as long as the car will last. I have never had to replace a K&N filter. Just clean, air dry with a fan, recoat the filter fabric with the oil and a thin film of K&N grease on the seal. The oil has a red dye in it, so you will know when you have full coverage. The K&N filters catch dirt better than any of the paper filters."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this on a car with 2 year old K&N; filter. The car wasn't driven much, but I thought I clean it anyway. It's really easy. Spray on cleaner, wait 10 minutes, then spray with water.  Dry, then spray on the red oil. Much easier using oil spray instead of the other type.My car has 2 K&N; air filters, and I used 2/3 of both cleaners and oil spray. So I can use this kit for one more.  However I was more than generous (or spray-happy). I'm sure I could've easily use this kit on two filters twice (4 total), instead of 3 filters."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My car and truck were both really running like crap... figured it was time to wash and recharge the filter. I sprayed it with their, basically soapy water, and waited a while as the bugs and gravel dust was loosened, and then rinsed it in the sink until clear. I let it dry in the sun for a few hours while I found something else to do, then sprayed the oil as if I were spray painting something... follow the instructions, don't want too much oil, don't want too little either. My Neon doesn't care if I over oil it, but my truck has a mass airflow sensor, it does care... it cares a lot! Under-oiling it causes the fine mist of gravel dust through the filter, too much clogs it quickly and I guess that's better than it going into the engine but the MAF Sensor gets coated with the oil and that will cause performance issues that the filter may have given you. It's a fine balance!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have a K&N; filter on my G35's cold air intake as well as on my truck, and have always use this to clean and re-oil it.It really works well. The cleaning solution really breaks down the oil allowing it to be rinsed off fairly easily and t he aerosol can makes re-oiling a breeze.The only issue I have is I ALWAYS run out of cleaning solution before I run out of the air filter oil. Granted, this may be a good thing as it prevents you from finishing cleaning off your filter then realizing you have no oil to re-oil it, which would leave you in a tight spot if you need your car to work and you can't get more filter oil quickly.So, even though I complain about that, it's really being picky."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Some of the other reviewers here prefer the aerosol, but I think the squeeze bottle is just fine for re-oiling a cleaned filter.  I don't know what everyone is complaining about.  This is something that's good to do while you have some yardwork or some reason to be outside since the filter needs to sit for about 15-20 minutes during the cleaning/oiling process.In the long run, if you keep your car long enough, one K&N; filter is cheaper than all of those disposables."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "K&N; Filter Care Service Kit - Squeeze BottleI bought the squeeze bottle version of the kit because I had heard the aerosol spray was difficult to meter accurately. I'm here to say that the squeeze bottle isn't a perfect solution either. I had to oil the Ducati Performance air filter for my 696, which is just a basic cylindrical filter except the \"dirty\" air comes in from the inside out. A typical conical filter on a car has the dirt collecting on the outside. The airbox on the 696 is set up so the dirt comes from the inside of the filter. This made it extremely difficult to oil properly.On a car filter, oiling the pleats evenly takes a lot of time and excess oil still tends to seep out. It takes some practice, time, and patience - probably a second filter doesn't hurt either.Overall: 4/5 stars, still difficult to oil the filter uniformly but easier to control versus the aerosol spray"}

Not sure what the issue is but the bulbs are burning out at a pretty often rate.  I just had one officer tell me both his lights burnt out last night, 01/23.2014.  Maybe the 130 watt bulb is just getting too hot but we have lost about 8 to 10 bulbs within a years time.  Hope KC reads this and can do something about that issue.  Other than that, they are a great, powerful light that reaches out so you can see those darn deer ahead of you.

Luckily, I was able to disassemble the new unit and utilize the old base-plate and the old bolts that hold the handle to the base-plate.  The new unit utilizes a pin and friction washer to hold the handle to the base-plate.  Had to destroy the friction washer to remove the pin and separate the new handle from the base unit.  Then it was just a matter of attaching it to the old base-plate with the old hardware.  The foam grip on the handle lasted for ten years on the old one, hopefully this one will last as long!  Did not give it a five star since they've changed their base-plate mounting system from what they were using ten years ago."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this based on the reviews. Though it seems to condition the leather, it didn't really seem to buff up the finish and restore my leather to its' original, or near new condition. After cleaning all the floors in my home, and all of my car's leather interior, I followed the directions on the package for conditioning and protecting the leather seats in my car.  While it does make the leather more supple and soft, it doesn't buff up to a shine, or even satin finish, Instead, it seems to leave a dull, chalky finish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this with the leather cleaner. I found it to be very good, but you have to wait for it to dry, which takes about a day. It does not stay as tacky as the leather honey conditioner which I also have bought. I feel the honey conditioner will be better in the long run, but if the leather is delicate the honey could potentially make it worse because it is very sticky and can wear the material as you rub it in. So in the long run, this is a great option."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you have leather seats in your car, this is the stuff you want to use on them. It gives them a silky smooth feel and a nice luster. Easy to apply too. No overwhelming odor like some leather products either. To me it makes my seats smell the way they did when they were new, so I guess the best description would be &#34;new car smell&#34;. As far as using it on any other leather items, I'm sure it would work great, but you'd have to take into account the car smell. Not sure you'd want your leather coat smelling like a car. :)My only negative quibble is the size of the bottle. It's huge. It will last for years. It would be nice if they offered it in a smaller size. (They might have one, but I couldn't find it.)"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Yes. It smells kinda funny. Yeah, if you leave it sitting long enough, you'll have these fatty looking clumps in the liquid. No, they don't disappear after shaking. And still, after all those years, that bottle of Lexol conditioner still worked great on my MDX's leather. Between the Lexol cleaner and this conditioner, the 10 year old car's leather already looked newer. It can't save the glazing the driver's seat acquired from use, but all the other seats did manage to look like that brand new leather look; slightly matte, firm, but supple.For the price, I think Lexol conditioner's great. Leatherique's conditioner is quite a bit more expensive."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "A liter of this stuff will last you a long time if you don't have many cars with leather seats. I just bought this for my lambskin leather jacket and my leather gloves. It seems to really soften up the leather. I think my jacket was really &#34;dry&#34; and it felt considerably heavier afterwards. The leather feels much more durable. My gloves are also much more water repellant and don't absorb water quite so quickly. I have no way of knowing if this is the best product on the market, but nonetheless it's pretty darned good!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this conditioner last year for my leather furniture and have been very happy with the results.  It does need to be applied every few months, but I've used it on a variety of leather surfaces (worn leather sofa, dining room chairs with leather padding, office chair) with excellent results.  As long as you don't apply it too thick, it won't leave an oily residue, and it blends into the leather very nicely.  I've gone through the original bottle and a refill, and am about to order another refill.For application, the Lexol sponges work great.  They can be rinsed and reused and last a long time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I got this Lexol Leather pH Cleaner Spray offline at a local auto parts store...and I am glad I did.I start cleaning my car and the first thing I notice is the citrus smell.

Well, the Griot cleaner cleaned old grime of the leather seats I had cleaned with the Lexol cleaner a week earlier.I have used a variety of leather cleaners over the years and in my experience this one does absolutely nothing."}

Even my girlfriend felt the car running better (without knowing that I had done anything to the car). I would recommend to any body who feels there car isn`t as peppy as before its really worth trying, just use as recommended.

I also poured some in the gas tank and it must have really cleaned any gunk out of there because I drive my jeep the same route every month and this last time I averaged almost 20mpg, which is a lot better than the 17 I used to average.  I would suggest using at night though, because your neighbors may call the cops thinking there is a fire with the amount of smoke that comes out the exhaust.  I would also suggest looking up videos online on youtube and typing in seafoam jeep.  That's what I did, and it proved very instructional."}

Not only did I take good care of it, constantly clean it, and always use premium fuel, but I would use Sea Foam from time to time. A lot of engine cleaners are similar, but Sea Foam has been around for a long time and seems to be one the strongest and most reliable brands. And at around 8-12 dollars a can (depending on where you buy from), its totally worth it for me to use every now and then.Also, don't just pour it into the fuel and oil tanks. Thats great for regular maintenance every 1k miles or so, but either find out, have a friend, or figure out (youtube) where the brake booster vacuum line is that runs to your engine. Running Sea Foam through that is what its known for and will reeeallllllly clean out your engine."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "A few years ago I began to notice a loss of power and rough idling, and our mechanic found no problems... he basically just told us that Ethanol sucks... to be more exact, ethanol sucks energy out of your car by generating lots of vapor that condenses and turns into water inside your engine as the engine cools down. This can lead to all sort of bad things including rough idle, corrosion, reduced power and a failure to easily start.He recommended a couple product -- SeaFoam and BG44K -- which quickly took care of the problem by helping remove the water and cleaning the valves and fuel injectors too. I buy BG44K when found at a good price, and SeaFoam when I can't; put a can into the Mustang's tank every three or four months, and drop one into my wife's SUV at least once per year.If you have something similar going on and you know it is not a mechanical issue, give this stuff a try. Recommended based on our experience with it."}

When I came out the next morning and started it the generator fired up, blew out some white smoke and ran like a champ. I let it run for an hour under full load of the A/C.

{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been using this stuff for YEARS.  It works great, it prevents the &#34;fogging&#34; on windshields, and it lasts a good long time.  And since it's not silicone based, it's not one of those cheap products that just shines up the surfaces, and dries them out so they crack.  Over years of applications in several cars an in the house, I've never had cracking issues.It will never provide a super shiny surface like the cheaper competitors, but that's not what it's for.  It's for cleaning AND protecting the surfaces."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this for years on my car dash and other vinyl areas of the interior. I always thought it worked and protected pretty well although it does evaporate on to the inside of the windshield, which is annoying. It also doesn't seem to last very long and as it starts wearing off, the dash looks very dry.I've since found303 Aerospace Protectant 32oz, and that works much better. It doesn't seem to exhibit any of the aforementioned issues, ie., it doesn't seem to go on to the inside of the windshield, and the shine lasts longer.  It also protects from UV just as well, if not better.  Note that Vinylex contains silicone, which actually damages the vinyl/plastic over time.I'm definitely sold on 303 Protectant over Vinylex now although I really like the Lexol pH leather cleaner and Lexol leather conditioner for my leather."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I followed the directions for cleaning the top but it did not do much as far as cleaning off the grease from the top mechanism on the lower sides of my tan fabric top. It did however provide a nice protective water resistant coating when applied as others have done here instead of using the sprayer. I used a brush and coated the top as if painting it. This way it goes on heavier and does not cause over-spray on painted or glass surfaces.While I only gave it a 3 star I am sure it is as good as the Rag Top brand and a lot less expensive. It should also be noted that our top is very old and was not properly cared for before we bought the car so it very well may work a lot better on a newer top."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "There is no swiveling between the cap, the tube and the bottle. In other words, when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car's brake fluid container, there will be kinking on the tube itself. Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid. They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose. That would be an ideal solution, but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature. However, I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each. I might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This made my brake flush just as easy as an oil change. Fill it up, tighten everything up (really tight, more on that later) pressurize and open caliper bleed nipples one by one.Couple nit-picks:1: Tough to tell when you are running out of fluid in the resivoir. The pressure bottle is a thick plastic that's barely translucent. Nearly pumped air through the entire brake system at the end because I couldn't tell the pressurizer was dry of fresh fluid.2: They really need to ship with a roll of teflon plumbers tape. The connection between the hose and the adapter leaked for me, and I had it tight as could be.Overall a must have for DIY brake jobs. Couple things hold it back from being a 5-star product."}

I know that is product has been around for many years and I kick my self for not trying it sooner.  This stuff is just great.  I read on how difficult it is to work with and I must say I found it to be a piece of cake.It was easy to apply and wipe off (I did it by hand). It took me about 90 minutes to do the All in One and the Sealant (mostly because you have to wait 30 minutes for the sealant to fully dry). However, make sure you use very little. Be sure have plenty of light (not sun light) when applying. I only applied one coat of the AIO and one coat of the KGS.  I want to see how long it last before I need to reapply to see its longevity."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The reviewers here who say to remove the black lens covering are not increasing their ability to see better, only increasing the glare to other drivers.  They are also breaking the seal  and allowing water intrusion to do so, for no benefit.The light pattern of these is not ideal but for the price is fine. Mount them properly, aim them properly, and use them in conditions that warrant their use and only then, and they are an effective product.But too many use automotive lighting incorrectly, thinking that a huge blast of light is allowing them to see better, when in all actuality all it is doing is constricting their pupil sizes, and vision, and blinding oncoming traffic.I hope cops start ticketing these fools who are using auxiliary lighting improperly, or retrofitting HID bulbs into halogen housings."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I mounted these on the bumper of my Ford F250. They are about 24\" off the ground; not too close to the pavement by any means. The housings started to leak within a week or two of being installed. I removed the lights and tried sealing with black silicone, but they still leaked. Perhaps because of the leak, the chrome started flaking off within a few weeks.  I now have very good looking lights, which leak, produce nearly no helpful light, and won't stay aimed in the direction I angled them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I was looking to buy some good fog-lights for my car, I did a lot of research, I was going to go for the Hella FF50, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money, so the second option was the Optilux 1450, like everyone said these are some pretty good quality fog lamps, they feel sturdy, however I agree with Tito's review, don't remove the black shields, as without them the lamps get very hot and you don't want to blind oncoming traffic, I tried a comparison side by side, one lamp with shield and the other one without it, I couldn't see a mayor difference. The cables are good, the only complaint that I have is the plastic switch, it feels a little cheap, but I'm hopping it will hold up."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this to replace a replacement cover. The old replacement cover was old, ripped and still smelled like the strong vinyl scent. This one is very nice. It is nice and smooth and feels good in your hands. It takes some muscle to install but once it is one there it looks good. It could be a tad cheaper but it looks well made. The stitching is solid and doesn't seem like it will come apart. It doesn't move at all once you place it on your steering wheel so you don't have to worry about that."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use the &#34;scary sharp&#34; method of sharpening knives, plane irons, and chisels. That involves wetting a sheet of abrasive, laying it on a flat surface, like a thick sheet of glass (I use a surface plate) and sharpening tools on that. For the occasional woodworker it's inexpensive and very effective, and a lot less messy than waterstones.Reshaping damaged edges, I start with something like 325 grit wet-or-dry . For normal honing I start with 3M's 800 grit sheet and finish with this. It provides a mirror finish and a single sheet lasts through many sharpening cycles. I'll probably eventually invest in a set of good waterstones ($150-200) but for now this is a good substitute."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I'm always hesitant to use tire-shine for personal reasons.  They always wear-off and sometimes they are just too shiny.This spray really does the job.  Its non-greasy and shiny.  It makes tires to look BLACK (the fluid is white/cloudy) and as i was applying it to the tires, i could see a difference.  It rained right after i left the carwash and after driving in the rain for 15mins the shine/cleanliness was still there.  So over all i'm super happy with this."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I was at our Good-Guys car show (with my show car) a few years ago and a (NAPA) dealer had this product for sale. They said try it and if you don't like it bring it right back and I'll give your money back. Well...I didn't and I have continued to use this for years since. This stuff is great and like others have stated really brings the new tire look without being too shiny. I used it on all the plastic and rubber parts to bring new life look back and also the colored plastic panels can bring the color back. None of it is permanent and tires need to be re done every other wash or so. I use the 'Eagle One Tire Swipe' applicator to apply the product or wipe it around for an even appearance. I have even used it sparingly on my Azek deck and keeps it looking sharp (but if too much can get slippery). Great product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is one good grease gun.  Yeah, it's easily twice to three times what you'd spend in a big box store for a grease gun but it's solid and heavy-weight.  It probably weighs twice the weight of the gun it replaces.  It's got an air pressure release valve to purge any trapped air.  The rubber hose is longer than most and that helps getting in those hard-to-reach places.  The tip snaps securely on the zerk fitting and the hose end fitting is adjustable to get a secure connection on the zerk valve.  And the one-handed operation of the squeeze handle is a delight to use.  I just finished using it to grease the spindles and wheels of my riding mower and it worked great.This has got to be the last grease gun you'll ever buy.  You'll thank yourself every time you use it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Can't say anything bad about the gun -- well constructed and built to last a lifetime. However, I see what people are talking about with the instructions. They're not really instructions. No parts labeled, nothing but a drawing of the unit itself, and another small diagram showing the spring release pulled back and locked. Other than that, the instructions literally consist of one 107-word run-on sentence that leaves you scratching your head. So just don't even read it, just throw it in the trash unless you want to laugh."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've used Meguire's cleaner wax for over two decades. The protection and finish are great. What I really like about this wax is that it does not create a build up, as using other waxes like carnuba can do over time.Reading some of the other reviews is frightening! Please don't mistake the work \"cleaner\" to mean a substitute for actually washing your car!! The cleaner function removes previous wax and oxidants... but you need to carefully WASH your car before applying this, or any other polish or wax."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "There are many types of clay out there but this works great on a newer vehicle or one that only needs to be dressed up a bit. Easy to work with and requires little effort. I use a spray lube and have found Mequiars Final Inspection does the job.Make sure the surface is washed before starting.Unless you drop some or have other issues, one bar will be enough for most vehicles. I've been able to do 3 small cars with one of these bars.You could shop all over and play hit or miss for a couple bucks or just do it right the first time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Wow this stuff really works when used correctly! I used the Meguire's Final Inspection spray as a lubricant (mandatory) and cleaned  off 5 years or road grime from the lower third of my SUV in no time at all. It was heavy and thick and not the paint is smooth as glass. Get a few containers of the clay for a SUV or large car because it does get dirty and you will drop a piece or two during the cleaning process. Meguire's has some very good How-To video's demonstrating the proper way to use this product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "First of all, THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A MOUNTING BRACKET! For the first time ever, I didn't read reviews here before purchasing and bought a separate mounting bracket which Amazon lists as \"frequently purchased together\". On the flip side though, I doubled up the brackets to make them a bit more sturdy. The bracket will bend backwards from the force of pushing the 7 pin plug in otherwise.The adapter itself is made of a thick plastic so corrosion shouldn't be an issue. Both covers work well and should keep out the elements though dielectric grease should be used as well. The wires are heavy (enough) gauge and have good jackets to them and the included crimp connectors are a nice bonus, though I always recommend soldering them.My only complaint is the cheap screws that come with it. Everything needed to mount it is included but it's very soft steel and strips with little effort. Do yourself a favor and pick up some nice stainless screws at least for where it mounts to the vehicle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Easy to install, setup, wire up and use.  Its nice to have one connection point and be able to plug pin what ever kind of trailer you might want to tow. It works great with my camper, snow mobile trailer, ATV trailer and my old beater gravel, dirt and construction material trailer.Installation:  If you have a 4 wire harness already installed (like I did) you can just plug into that for all the lights, blinkers and brake lights, then simply add a break controller for trailer breaking  and connect to the wiring on the multi tow adapter. It also has pass through power connections for your attached trailer- which is great for charging your camper batteries while driving down the road.  We used this feature all summer while dry camping (camping with out plug in power) all over the midwest United States."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I needed to extend the length of the reach of the charge controller in my solar panel system setting, and after checking the prices of the extensions for sale, I decided to make my own.I bought these to cut in half and use at the end of the wires. These work so good that soon I'll be ordering more, because I'm planning to build a battery bank, and using these will lower the cost for sure.Also, they are easy and secure to disconnect and reconnect to the different component within the solar panel system setting."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Works well as a way to adapt our car's 7 blade trailer hookup to also work on our 4 wire bicycle trailer. The LEDs are particularly appreciated, as a way of ensuring proper functioning of trailer lighting to at least that point. The rubber cover for the 4 contacts is also much appreciated.Our lawn mower once ran over this, damaging it enough that we bought another, though the original does still work - despite no longer being quite all there.My only other suggetion is that it's not always obvious in the dark which side goes up, though it does eventually only fit one way.Recommended!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out, and so does this Adapter. But I really wouldn't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well, with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector, aligning all the pins correctly. It's a tight fit so that it won't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I don't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested.  Frankly, I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway, with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works.  I presume the LEDs will tell me if there's an issue some day."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I own my own detailing business and use this product exclusively for three purposes.  1. As a clay lubricant for paint contamination removal and 2. Putting the finishing touch on vehicles that are freshly painted and/or have had recent body work.  I love the fact that it's body shop safe, and 3. Prepping my polishing pads.  Otherwise, for anything else I use Meguiars synthetic spray detailer that wipes off even easier and has the added benefit of putting a protective \"film\" over the vehicle.  Another great product by Meguiars."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Had my 13 yr old car painted and the  body shop said no waxing for 90 days to let the paint out gas. I live in FL with bug season and water spots from washing and general dirt abound. Called Meguries and this stuff is body shop safe. Which means it will let the new paint out gas. I have been using it with excellent results between washes. Once the 90- days are up I will use a permeate wax.For really tough bug stains I use DP Detailers road kill bug remover and then the final inspection to bring the shine back. On very light bug splats the Final inspection works fine."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It's intended for easy cutting the paint. A nice thing Meguiar's been doig is having the scale shown on the label. This is one of the lowest indexes available for paint cutting.For the amount it comes (16oz) it should last for about years to come using on a single car.I'll try it with my PorterCable to figure out if it was a good purchase and this will be updated. If the case, I'll buy from other brands like Wolfgang or Black Diamond (better rated but 2x the price). Anyways, wait for the update."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff works pretty well at removing light swirls and scratches.  They take seconds to get in your clearcoat and hours to remove if done properly.There were some deep defects that were diminished but I didnt want to burn through the clear as I have not done paint repair before.  This is the Pro version of Swirlx and I tried them side by side and this works better than Swirlx.  Maybe its the placebo effect but most of the swirls are gone without any damage to the paint using a cheap Harbor freight DA polisher and their orange compounding pad.  I did follow this up with Ultimate polish then Mirror glaze for a really good black finish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've used the Meguiar's professional line for years and couple them with the Meguiars pads used on a Porter Cable 7424 random orbital polished.  Results are outstanding.  This time, I had to rescue the finish from an incompetent transport company that wiped down the car dry trying to be &#34;helpful&#34; leaving it a mass of swirl marks.  Even this wasn't abrasive enough to remove them, had to go the low cut cleaner first then this polish and all is right with the world.  Two potential problems with this product - if you use an orbital polisher that isn't random, you'll likely burn through your paint if you are not a pro.  Second, DO NOT let the product dry before wiping off and when wiping off, a very damp cloth helps a lot.  Change the cloth (micro fiber preferred) frequently (I use about a dozen to do a small Mazda Miata as they will load up quickly).  Use the product sparingly - a little does a lot."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I am working on my own truck and am not a mechanic.  I have not used the pump on the truck, yet, but just tested the pump for functions and leaks.This pump has 2 functions: vacuum and pressure, which are selected with a knob on the side.  The pressure release valve has a large handle, but this makes it easy to accidentally release the pressure.  The gauge swivels, so the gauge must be fitted with an o ring.  It comes with a nice case and all the little parts has their own places.For both vacuum and pressure, nothing leaked for at least 20 minutes.For about $72.00, Mityvac beats the Lisle vacuum pump (single function and came with broken pressure release valve) handily.Even though it will be extra expense, I plan to look for a bigger container for draining brake fluid.  I bought a rubber cork stopper to see if I can make my own air tight container."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Great all around product with strong uv protection especially important here in Florida. Used another product that really screwed up my dash  board. This fixed it right up and does not leave a shinny surface that is going to reflect in your windshield. I would describe the finish it leaves as satin. I would suggest spraying it on a cloth when doing your dash board so as not to get it on the inside of the windshield. If you just want to use one product for all your rubber and vinyl this is it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "this is an excellent final coat wax for your car.  In my case I use the Meguiar's NXT polish,  wait several hours to let it cure, then apply this wax.  I use it on my car that has color (my other car is white).  Be aware, it is harder to buff this.  I maintain my cars by hand and became tired thei first time I used it.  (I washed, clayed, hand compounded, then did 2 coats of wax).  The next car I did I paced myself and washed/ compounded one day.  Then the next day I polished and waxed the car."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "When I first got it, the wrench did work, however, it was never that easy to use due to needing to be flared out first to fit over the filter.  At some point, I lost the spring (not sure why it could even detatch) and then it was rendered completely useless.  Ended up buying a couple of the large socket looking ones that come in three sizes to fit common filters.  They're a bit cheaper, but I had to buy multiple so they end up costing more.  But, they also work, easily, every time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This tool surprised me.  It is made extremely well, I can't over-state this.  This will fit 99.9% of all oil filters, and there is no struggling with other types of tools/wrenches.  It has a spring mechanism where you simply put a ratchet on this and it self fits to any size filter.. and you twist.  Great grip,.. best wrench I've ever used and being universal mean you never need to swap out for another for any other vehicles/tractors, etc.  This replaces a dozen other tools."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is the one to buy!Pros:- Cheap- Just the right size to remove the blue oil filter on my 2011 Subaru WRX. Attaches to a standard 3/4\" ratchet. Hasn't seen a filter on my car that it couldn't remove.- If you're not sure about your filter size, it comes with a template on the back so you can measure up your car's filter against it to see if it works for you before you open it. I like that it has a good range of filters it can accommodate.Cons:- For filters that have been overtightened (i.e. at the dealership), it permanently dents the filter, but who cares? It doesn't dent the filters I installed to the proper tightening specification.- Packaging is kind of weaksauce, but I could care less.- It's not very pretty, and the spring and mechanism are all exposed, but again, this tool is about functionality and you only use it once every couple months."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This item is primarily used for REMOVAL, not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand. The half-circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn. The tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer. Each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes.  I used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle. I probably won't have to use it ever again. In 40 years of DIY oil changes across a couple dozen different cars, I've never had a leak by simply hand-tightening the canister to the mount."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If it works, it works pretty good.  Chances are you will get one with a missing O ring though.  Several people on car forums I am a member of receive defective items including myself.  I called customer service after multiple emails went unanswered.  I told them I think it was missing an o ring because it would not hold a vaccum.  They said \"yep it might be\" and that was it, no \"we will get one right out to you\" or ship it back for an exchange.  They were very rude.  I just sealed it with some gasket maker and it works now but looks terrible.  I would go with a different unit with beter quality control."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you are adjusting headlights on a Ford with 4mm adjusting screws this tool is a must. The review that states that the screw moves out enough to keep you from removing the tool from the end of the screw is questionable however. On all the  headlights I have seen, the adjustment on the light moves in and out and the screw dose not, so If you can get the tool on, you will always be able to get it off. Tool is well made and the infinite ratchet is handy. Should last a lifetime even though the vehicle will not. All mechanics I know have one and Amazon is the cheapest. I ordered one that said it was used, in good condition, for ten bucks. When it arrived, it was on the original blister pack, unopened. This is not always the case, but this time, it was. If you are thinking of buying one of these tools, do it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This tool fits easily behind the headlight area in my 1996 Ranger pickup. The long handle makes it simple and quick to make adjustments. I saw in other reviews that the space in other Ford vehicles is tight, but there's plenty of room in the Ranger.It's not obvious which way to turn the screws for up/down or left/right, so you have to experiment. You just flip the wrench around to turn the other way. Unlike regular \"clicking\" ratchet wrenches, the fine-ratchet capability on this tool makes it easy to do micro-adjusting, and it also makes sure that you can turn the headlight screw even if you have only a short swing on the ratchet handle.(FYI: for the Ranger, the bottom screw is vertical, top screw is horizontal.)A great tool, makes an otherwise crummy job simple."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After I replaced the old faded headlights on my 2000 Ford CVPI, I noticed that they needed to be adjusted. I called a \"local and official\" state lamp adjusment shop and they quoted me $80 to adjust the two new headlamp assemblies I bought on E-Bay for $50. Right. So I tried to adjust them myself but it was very difficult and time consuming. I bought this tool from a local Napa Auto Parts store. The tool worked OK but unfortunately because the head is so big, it would only turn to a certain extent before being stopped by the other metal piece to the rear of the headlamp assembly unit. Another reviewer below mentioned the same problem. So in the end, the tool was really useless because I could not use it to completely turn the small screws all the way back towards the rear. Ford made such a poor design of their frame that I cannot believe how hard it was to change out my bulbs and headlamp assembly much less adjust them properly."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Ordered this tool to align new headlamps I installed in my ranger. If you're looking at this review right now, you probably already know how difficult it is to access the headlamp adjusters. Thats where this little bundle of joy comes in, making it nearly effortless to align ford headlight assemblies. When you're not able (or willing) to use a small ratchet and metric socket to adjust the headlamps, than this is the tool for the job. And as always, Lisle makes an awesome product (which mostly tend to be made in the USA). Overall, great buy."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this kit to give me the parts to do tie rods and center link on an old MB diesel.  The kit was perfect and the tools were decent.  My main issue and reason for not given five stars is that this is not US-made.  Global economy or whatever, when I'm looking for quality tools, I'm not looking for products from overseas sold at top prices.  Sure, these are better than Harbor Freight, but I doubt the third world labor to make this was much higher than the HF part.But that is a rant to have another day, and I can point you towards a better kit for now.  So this is a great tool set for the DIY mechanic.. But I do hope that OTC brings manufacture to the USA."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this to simply pop the lower ball joint on my 2006 Land Rover LR3 with 70K miles. I couldn't use the venerable pickle fork, so I had to breakdown and buy a front end set. This kit paid for itself in this one job alone. The dealer wanted over $700 for this job; It cost me $200 for parts and $94 for this kit. I used the longest puller for my job and it easily popped off the ball joint with just a couple of cranks with a normal length 1/2 drive breaker bar. The puller didn't even flinch. No warps or bends in the claws.I suspect this kit will serve me for life since I won't be abusing it with a commercial rate of use. I do work on cars more than the average backyard mechanic and I am confident you don't need to drop $400 more on a commercial grade name brand set."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is perhaps one of the best air chucks you can buy. True, it isn't cheap and you get what you pay for.Unfortunately though, it does not work 100% on the dualies on my motorhome, which is why I bought it. Turns out, I need the chuck version that has a straight inner tire chuck and angled outer tire chuck. This item has both angled inner and outer chucks.But I can buy a replacement chuck (which Amazon does not sell), or a combination chuck with 12&#34; hose (which Amazon does sell), so I can retrofit the chuck for my type dualie setup.I am giving it 5 stars because I simply ordered the wrong item, so I am not going to gig the product because of that. Amazon though could describe the products a bit better rather than making me go to the vendor's website and looking up the product number to see which one is what I need."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I believe if your looking for something to make airing anything up these are &#34;The cats rear end.&#34; If you are some guy who want to complain that it's off .25698 of a pound or 1.94236 of a pound spend the 8000 dollars for the top of the line air gauge. If you want to air something up and recheck it with you .50 air gauge or your 30.00 Snap-on air gauge that was certified and find the numbers are off then don't buy this. If you like me, average Joe, that uses it to check tire pressure, air kids basketballs, and around the house airing jobs, I have had 2 in my life this is the 2nd in 40 years and they both work perfect for these needs and have never failed. Great shipping and thanks again Amazon for offering at cheaper price."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a nice, sturdy guage to check spark plug gap.  However, it has only an inch scale, with no metric equivalent on the reverse side.  So if you plan on gapping your plug to a metric value, forget this guage.  Even so, it felt good to use and not at all flimsy.  It's smoothly finished and the marking are clear and legible, making it easy to read.  Well worth what I paid for it.PS. Another reviewer said the one he received had the metric markings on the back side.  I found no such markings on mine -- perhaps the one I received was defective.  In any event, that doesn't alter my rating.  I still like it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just want to say thank you to milton for making a METAL tread depth gauge. I hate those little plastic ones. The best part about it is the numbers on the gauge are recessed, stamped, into the metal. So even if the black ink were to come off (hasnt come off ater a few years) you can still read the numbers. A little bit of lubrication with some silicone or rust penetrant helps keep it sliding smooth, and if you dont, it rusts up and makes it really rough and may even give some strange tread depth readings. The pintle is quite strong (used it as a screwdriver on a desperate situation once) and the ink is long lasting."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had always used a different brand for all my interior car detailing.  I was out of product and came across this.  After reading some of the reviews I thought I would give it a try. Was I ever happy I did. This is the best detailing product for all interior car surfaces that I have ever used.  My car is 12 years old and I have always kept it clean and looking good.  After using Mother's Protectant on the dash and interior surfaces everything looked new again!  Even the faux wood trim.  I then applied the product to every seal around the window and doors, they then looked deep black and new.  In spots that were to small to get into I used an old toothbrush.  I have now made Mother's Protectant my go to interior detailing product as well as the product I use on all weather stripping and rubber seals."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I detailed two of my cars this week and used a paste wax on the Corvette while going through the identical process on my Jeep except using this liquid wax as the last step. The wax was very easy to put on and easy to use. In-fact I think it was easier to use than the paste wax. However, when I put both vehicles side by side the shines look identical. I think that is a plus for the liquid wax as it is easier to put on and remove than the paste waxes. I have never gotten a bad Mother's product. This is highly recommended. It may cost a  fraction more than some of the store brands however it is worth it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I began with Step 1 Polish, and Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, and finished up with the Step 3 Wax, using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint.  The Powerball put the wax on smoothly and uniformly, and after doing Step 1 and Step 2, my hands welcomed the break using the Powerball.  The car looks a brilliant white now.  With all the work preparing the finish, I put 3 coats of wax on it.  The car is a full-size, and there is enough Step 1 and Step 2 to do at least another car, and despite the 3 coats of wax, there is still enough in the bottle for maybe another 2 or 3 wax jobs.  Very pleased with the 3 Step process, and the Powerball."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I drive an older SUV that has a lot of plastic on the outside. The plastic trim had lost it's color and looked sun damaged and pretty terrible. At first, \"back to black\" didn't sound like what I needed, since the plastic I needed to treat was grey, not black. But, I read about this stuff on another website, and it can be used for all sorts of plastics/vinyls etc., not just black color. Anyway, this stuff really works. My car is looking much better now. I did the first coat and it is looking very good. I'll follow up with another coat soon, and hopefully it will look even better!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The Jeep Wrangler (1999 model) has wide plastic type fenders over each wheel well. These black plastic fenders, at least on my vehicle, turned and discolored over the years. I tried numerous products and while many would restore the black, the color would eventually fade and I would be right back to where I started. I ordered this Mother's product and applied that to my fenders. I was very surprised at the amount of color restoration I got from applying two or three coats. The black did return and my fenders looked great. I have now been driving the vehicle about three months and I still have nice looking fenders. I also used the polish on my black running boards and the end caps on both the front and rear bumpers. All received the polish well and color looks good. It is easy to apply and then wife. Don't leave the polish on too long after drying as it will be more difficult to polish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I began with Step 1 Polish, and continued with the Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint.  The Powerball saved my hands, and this Micro-Polish and Glaze made the white surface of my car reflect like a mirror.  You can't see the micro scratches easily on a white car, but you could see how smooth the surface was, and you could feel it.  I followed up with 3 coats of the Step 3 wax, and the car looks showroom new.  There is enough left in the bottle, after doing my full-size car, for at least another full-size car.  Good value!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have been using this for years, and it is hands down the best quick detailer on the market. Products like Meguiars Ultimate Detailer are more of a spray wax type product rather than a detailer, as they withstand car washes. However, those products cannot be used on fresh paint, and they are a bit harder to apply/remove than the Mothers Showtime (which is safe for fresh paint - confirmed with Mothers). Not to mention it has a great smell, provides a deep shine, and fills in light swirl marks. The 24oz version from Amazon is a great deal, and if you try it, you won't be disappointed. The same goes for any Mothers product, actually."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The good news is that this is easy to spray on and wipe off. The spray handle gives a fine mist that covers a good area. The spray wipes off easily. The bad news is that the shine is not much better than if I had just washed it and left it. Maybe it will get better over time as the coating builds up. It also streaks a bit but this is minimized if you use a good microfiber cloth.  It's good stuff but doesn't give me the kind of shine I would get from a regular wax job."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is one of the necessary evils to keep my vehicles looking good. It is not a lot of fun but it gets all the contaminats off your vehicle so you can polish. Comes with everything you need. Just spray the lubricant on the vehicle and on the clay itself and start rubbing. It is amazing how much comes off even after it has been washed. I normally do a 2 ft x 2 ft section and refold the clay after each section is done to get a clean side. When it becomes pretty bad I use it to clean off my wheels. I've tried both Meguiars and Mothers and I like Mothers a little better."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used Mothers California Gold Clay Bar to clean my car's paint before using DA polisher.  I washed my car two times and then used Mother's clay bar.  Even after two washes, when I ran my hand on the paint to feel the surface before and after claying I could feel the difference.  After claying the paint was appreciably smoother.The application was very easy - just spray the included solution and slide the bar on the paint, knead the clay when it smudges appear.  The box warns that if the bar is dropped it has to be discarded, so I was mindful of not dropping it and I did not.  It was quite easy to hold and use.The only thing I did not like about this product is that the solution smelled like cinnamon.  I am not a fan of cinnamon and that smell is unpleasant to me.Overall, this is a great product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It's a good kit for beginners because it has everything you need to get started.  I used this on my six month old Honda.  Since it's still new, there wasn't oxidation or anything like that.  Just normal industrial fallout that left a non-smooth feel when stroking the surface with the back of your hand.  Well, after claying the surface it's like someone finally gave the surface a real bath - baby smooth now.  I also used this on the glass and same effect."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I like this kit a lot!It comes with 2 bigs bars of clay, think double the size of the Meguiars kit.A bottle of detail spray and a average quality microfiber cloth.I used autowash soap/water as a lube for the clay, did a great job on my 7 yr old van, I only washed it in 7 yrs....the paint is now smooth as a baby's bum, waxed it....My kids were wondering why the van was sooo slippery smooth and shineyI saved the detail spray to keep my cars looking tip top after washes.Great price here at Amazon, will keep buying it here."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "There are two (2) 50 gram bars in the package but there is enough clays on each bar that I cut them in halves & used the halves without any problem.Water hardness makes a noticeable difference. If you have hard ground water like I do, my advice is to spend the few extra bucks to wash & clay your car in a self car wash where the water is softened or deionized.Other wise you will not reap the full benefit of claying a car as you are just grinding the paint with microscopic mineral deposits.Use water as lubricant, do not leave any soap on the paint & use the suds as lubricant as the chemical in soap will quickly break down the clay bar itself. You will find the clay \"disintergrate\" after 1-2 car washes if you rely on soap as lubricant."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This RTV is intended for primary use as engine gasket maker - temperature and oil resistant. But it also works well as general purpose RTV when the near-black (dark gray) color is desirable. Which was true for my application - making gaskets for mounting car speakers in odd sized door application that required custom spacers. Worked great.The dark color is especially troublesome to get off the hands - use disposable gloves during application.This package, a small &#34;squeeze&#34; tube is not easiest for application of a regular bead. It is easier to use the slightly larger, calk-gun sized package, so consider that if the larger quantity is also helpful."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This Permatex Ultrablack is wonderful stuff, a tough sealant and it does NOT tend to harden in the tube - - it's always ready to use when I take off the cap. Unfortunately, this particular item is ONLY 1/2 OUNCE!!So it's not a good deal for the price. There is no info in the item posting, you have to notice the image and the \"0.5oz\" on the package (which I didn't). Go for the 3.5 ounce tube, much better deal.5 stars for the product, 2 stars for the incomplete description."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this in order to seal some parts of my car's valve cover mating surfaces.The shop I paid for the timing belt service to be done did not do a good job.Valve cover gasket never leaked before, it started leaking after they put a new gasket.Obviously they did not clean the mating surfaces.I did the job myself since I did not trust the mechanics at that particular shop.It does not leak now.This product also helped me repair parts of glass molding (rubber parts around the rear glass) that started cracking, falling off.All in all it is a great product and is worth the money."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this product due to the fact that I was (unfortunately) involved in a small collision, where another driver hit my passenger side of my car, backing up. Anyway, there was decent scratches all along both passenger side doors, as well as white marks from the offending vehicle.After cleaning the area lightly, and applying this with the Meguiars Applicator pads (which weren't cheap, but ended up being worth it), many of the scratches which were an eyesore were actually gone. I applied this for around 3 minutes on bad areas, and 1-2 on minor areas, working it in and adding more as I massaged the scratches.This isn't a miracle cure for paint by any means, but it for sure masked many scratches that weren't too deep. Unfortunately, it doesn't last if you wash the car, or even if the car gets wet in a mild rain shower.I would not recommend this product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I would have purchased it on Amazon, but I could not wait to try it out. It works better than I thought on light scratches that do not go through the paint but only through the clear-coat. I was able to quickly fix damage caused by rubbing against a metal fence. The side panel looks 97-99% as good as new. As others have mentioned, It takes a lot of elbow grease. Nest time I'll invest in a power polisher. Boy do my arms hurt. But with a power polisher, you have to be careful to not burn the finish. Thank you all Fellow \"Amazonians\" for the reviews and tips."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product works at least as well as other similary priced scratch removers/hiders....only really effective on very shallow and narrow scratches and swirl marks. I have tried 3 of these specialized scratch products, and none of them hide scratches quite as well as regular Eagle One NanoWax (now discontinued). These products work by filling in the scratch with material that makes the scratch visible only under certain lighting conditions and viewing angles. Meguiars, like most of the others, work better than ordinary wax at hiding very minor scratches, but don't expect miracles."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I closed the garage on my car by accident while backing out.  Not sure what happened but my stupid &#34;smart car&#34; didn't detect the garage door closing and it closed on my trunk!  So much for technology making life easier.  Back to &#34;looking back&#34; instead of depending on sensors and my back-up cam.Any how, the garage door put a huge scratch on my trunk and taillights.  I was able to remove all the surface scratch on my trunk and it looks good as new!The scratch on the chrome molding and taillight was too deep and couldn't be removed.  But I knew that when I got this.  This product is great for those light scratches.Easy to apply and easy to buff out.  I just use a regular cotton towel.  Microfiber towels are too soft."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this on my dark red mustang and did half the car only. I could not tell any difference. Went back and finished the car and it looked great but it look great before using this so not sure what I was gaining.By reading all the reviews I was expecting a wow factor.Maybe it does better on older cars but my mustang is not new either but in good shape.Also used it on an 09 Focus and again, no difference.Makes me wonder with these clear coats in that these products do not get down to the paint level and sinceclear coats are already glossy, a good polish does little.Not that impressed but will give it 3 stars since most people have good luck with it but my advise is if you havea car with good paint and clear coat, do not expect miracles."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Nu Finish and this product were listed as the top spots with Nu Finish liquid beating this one out only due to a lower cost and it being their best buy then.  Well I have Nu Finish and I have used it on a lot of cars and there is nothing wrong with it.  I just wanted to try something new.  This stuff goes on with less mess than the Nu Finish, comes off easier IMHO and also I believe it has a better shine.  I did however use a Meguiars polish before putting this wax on and I had never done that before ever using the Nu Finish.  I'll wax with this stuff about once a month and every weekend when I don't use this wax I use theMeguiar's Ultimate Quik Wax"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've owned this wax for some time.  It doesn't last more than a month - if that. It's a pain to put on and take off.  It goes on ok, but taking it off is another story, leaves a almost a oily residue until you wash your car, or use numerous towels/microfiber to take it off.  How much do you really want to rub your paint to get the residue off (I have black paint)?  I haven't really seen any good protection from the elements or from birds/bugs.  One postitive is that it does smell good when applying it but I'm sure Meguiars added the fragrance for some marketing perspective.  All in all, for the price compared to durability - this stuff is a waste and not sure why Meguiars even put it on the market."}

I only had one pad and had to wash it after using Mirror Glaze and before using NXT Wax. I attached the wet pad to the DA polisher and turned it on to spin the water out of the pad. The pad did not fly off.Using the DA Polisher and foam pads allowed me to perform a lot of time and labor consuming tasks in a lot less time if I attempted to do it by hand.I am very satisfied with this pad."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Had I been thinking I would have taken before and after shots of the flute cleaning.  Basically, the flute hadn't been used in over 30 years and sat around becoming dull and oxidized.  Needless to say, after some dabs of Flitz and about 10 or more squares of paper towels, it looks brand new!  The paper towels and my hands were so black with oxidation, it was truly amazing.This stuff has done it all for me and I can easily say it is the best cleaner an polish out there.  Hands down."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have used Flitz extensively over a 15 year timeframe.  I used to detail corporate aircraft, and we had large panels of polished aluminum on spinners, nacelles, and leading edges of the wings.  Flitz made the job go quick, and it provided one of the longest lasting results.  Today, I still use it on cars for brightwork, and on jewelry, silverware, and a multitude of other uses.  2 pounds lasts me a long time despite frequent use.  Flitz also does a good job restoring plastic headlight lenses."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I ordered this polish to clean up my aluminum wheels as demonstrated on a YouTube video. It did a good job with the wheels but I also tried it on the oxidized headlight lenses of the car as well. I didn't use any powered buffing wheel as I wasn't sure of the effect on the plastic. However, it didn't take too much rubbing to totally restore the clarity of the lenses. I've also used this on brass and it really worked there too. A little bit goes a long way so this tube should last quite a while."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This pad and the yellow polishing pad are perfect. Cell foam material is durable, wash and reuse. This pad worked perfectly on my Home Depot's Ridgid Random Orbital Sander with the hook and loop pad. Don't spend $140+ on a so called \"car\" random orbital polisher. The Ridgid is basically the same thing...yet only costs $60 and I can use it for home improvement work after my car is done. Meguiar's Scratch X 2.0 also works good with this pad to remove minor scratches and blemishes. Use Ultimate Compound for heavier oxidization."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this item because my hydraulic jack was leaking and I always had to top it up everytime I wanted to use it, which alone can take me 15 to 20mins to do.  With this, I just drive up and in a matter of about 2 mins I'm ready to work on my car.  It makes my DIY fluid changes and inspections MUCH easier and quicker.I have a 2005 Mazda 3, and I have absolutely no problems with it sliding, moving, or touching when I drive up on it.Although my car is not even half the weight of the 8000lb capacity model, I bought the 12000lb version just to be on the safe side.I've had this product for just under a year, and I use it every 4 - 5 weeks.  I highly recommend it if you like to save money and do your own oil changes."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Agree with everybody else this is a great polisher.  A bit on the costly size BUT is seems to last forever because you need so little.Not something I use every day but often enough so I always know where it is.  Couple years ago my tube looked empty so I ordered another.  That \"empty\" one is still going and going.  Just a dab goes and goes.One caviat, use an old T-shirt to polish with and whatever cloth you use do not plan on washing grey to black remains out of the cloth.  No big deal.Bought a gorgous old Navy brass 8\" bell with lots of tarnish.  Looked pretty good with the old patena but even better with the bright shine Simicrome put on it.  Been hanging outside long enough to put the patena back, LOL.  Use it to call the birds at feeding time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used Simichrome on some golf irons where I used a MAP torch to heat the epoxy. This caused a light heat stain to form on the hosel, which is just surface oxidation. Simichrome removed it, but so did Blue Magic which is less expensive and readily available.I tried Simichrome on my Ducati exhaust, which has turned purple at the cylinder heads. Simichrome didn't even dent the oxidation, which Blue Magic will help reduce. I did notice that Simichrome seems to provide a brighter luster to polished surfaces and even brushed surfaces.Overall: 3/5 stars, expensive, can be hard to find, Blue Magic does the same job mostly. I felt Simichrome provided a shinier finish after an application."}

No success at all.  Again pulled out the mother's,,,,although slow and tedious, it did the job with no damage to ceramic coating.Screw on lid on mother's makes far better sense.  Semichrome lid requires an inconvenient  pry tool to remove,,,,which tends to clobber lid causing it to not seal well.  Additionally semichrome is somewhat on the order as twice as expensive.  I should have purchased a tube instead of a can to give it a try,,,would have saved 15 or so dollars."}

I did it both vents but never emptied the can. Then ran the blower. It wasn't until a few days later when the weather was typically that which would make me notice the musty smell but it wasn't there!! Very, very happy with this and even happier that I didn't have to take the truck to a repair shop for a 'flushing' of the venting system. Try it, you'll like it!!"}

{"label": 2, "raw": "ArmorAll is great if you're in your teens and want your interior to look like you cleaned it with a can of crisco.  Even their matte products still leave you with a glossy sheen.  When it comes to me and my cars, I tend to look for quality products that I can use over and over again.  I've always found that with einszett products.  From interior to exterior, their products work flawlessly and produce great results.  The additional minty, slightly clinical yet sweet smell is always welcome in my vehicles.  Don't think twice, you won't be disappointed."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Simply the best protectant I've ever tried. No greasy feeling like armor all, no tacky feeling like Meguiar's. The scent is a pleasant &#34;fresh&#34; smell. Does a fairly good job of taking off scuffs and such. It doesn't seem to attract dust, so flat trim looks better longer.A little goes a long way. I find I use about a quarter as much of this as I do the other protectants when doing my interior. Given this, while it isn't cheap, it really ends up costing less over the long term."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "This little product has its place, but I don't think in its present form that it can replace road flares.  The idea is a good one, and with a little tweaking, the product might be a great item for an emergency road kit.  If they made the flare bigger, larger light emitting head, and light from all sides, I think they would have a winner.  In its current form, it is too small and too lightweight to be of much use.  One would need several, and at almost $10 each, that would be expensive.  I think a couple of them in a glove box might be a good idea, but no replacement for a huge flashlight and some road flares.A good idea but needs work."}

This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse.  It can ONLY be viewed from straight on!  While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam.  DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare?  No way."}

And if there are lights beyond your vehicle it may get lost.  However, it is inexpensive and certainly better than leaving your emergency blinkers on if you are going to be away for long enough for them to drain your battery.  I wouldn't buy just one per vehicle.  I'd buy several.  The magnetic feature is very handy.  But the key is getting your vehicle off the road as far as possible so emergency lighting is not as important.  If you can't I'd use emegegency flashers and get back to your vehicle ASAP.  And forget about using this during the day.  You can't see it from far enough away to avoid an accident."}

In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a \"vanity\" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.

If you have plastic bumpers, don't use this, it will leave marks. A friend of mine did that with my jack and them complained. Like it was the jacks fault he was stupid. This is metal and could scratch if you are trying to lift someone that is softer material. Comes with bolts that look too small but do the job. I added larger ones that are stronger, but the ones that come with it are rated for the correct weight loading. You need this for your jack. Will help with some fence posts of odd shape as well."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have used Mobil 1 on all my vehicle's for years and after buying a new to me, HD 2010 ultra Limited was pleased to see the they also made the V-twin moil 1 for it. I call them to ask what makes this a better product than the OEM oil that HD sell's and they explained that it is specially formulated to meet or exceed the requirement need with air cooled HD engineers as well as trans and primary case requirements. I believe that they manufacture a superior product and will be only running it on my bike."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Our BMW came with run-flat tires and no room for a spare.  Those run flats were noisier, wore out faster, and rode rougher than the non-run flat version of the same tire.  They were also much more expensive.  We swapped to those non-run-flat tires but worried about finding a roofing nail or bad pothole in the road one day and regretting it.Thanks to this kit we no longer have to worry.  I've used slime in other cars before an it outperforms fix-a-flat easily.  Its a little harder to put in than the competitor but you can keep this in your car year-round and you couldn't do that with an aerosol can.This kit can help provide peace of mind for you whether you keep it in your car, your spouse's car, your kid's car, or wherever."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had K&N; filters before on BMW cars in the early 2000s, despite all sorts of warnings about it can damage mass air flow (MAF) meter. Love them because they do give that extra-something to the engine during acceleration.K&N; now assures public that its tests were accepted by major car manufacturers, and that it will not void any warranty by the dealer service centers. That obviously speaks volumes. I got this for a recent model Sienna V6 and it fits fine. Look forward to save money over the lifetime while increase engine performance a bit."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is my third K&N; filter that I had purchased. When Amazon had a sale, I immediately bought a third for my 05 Camry. I also have filters for my 2007 Highlander and 1997 Chevy G3500. They all have given me smoother acceleration and a 10% increase in fuel economy. I went from 19-20MPG to 22-23MPG. It's only a couple MPG, but it really adds up in the long run. I wasn't expecting massive gains, because as other reviewers have said, if these filters gave significant increases in MPG, all the Car manufacturers would be installing these as standard or creating their own versions.As for the horsepower increase claim, I would only know if I put the car on a Dyno, so I can't say if there's a difference.Overall, worth the buy if you don't want to keep buying new disposable filters."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I needed this cleaner for my leather couches.  These are big couches, a lot of surface area to clean.  Prior to that, I wasn't getting the leather clean all the time using just a damp cloth.While I don't enjoy cleaning, I didn't mind too much using this Lexol product.  This is a very mild product that you don't have to be careful about in terms of breathing or getting it on your clothes.  With a little scrubbing action, like circular movements, it foams up a bit and the leather gets cleaned.  It really works.I've used the Lexol leather conditioner for awhile.  That one is not as easy to work with because you have to buff your leather, and you'll want to ventilate the room while using a lot of it as I do.  But the Lexol leather cleaner is mild and easy to use."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I always use this followed by an application of lexol leather conditioner. I've also used Blue Magic leather cleaner and conditioner and I found this to be much better. The blue magic stuff generally leaves my leather feeling a bit dry and not slick. I usually apply to leather then leave it to sit for 15 minutes before applying leather conditioner. It gets rid of dirt smudges quite well without leaving much of a spot like you see if cleaning with water.I've also tried this on leather shoes. It helped remove a few minor scuffs (probably just dirt). but bigger scuffs do remain. Should always follow with leather conditioner."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I'm not a professional and I haven't spent a lot of time detailing my car, but I did some research and wanted to get the best feel and look for my car and tried this product. I've heard everyone talk about the clay and I really don't know the difference, but that may be simply that I am new to detailing my car. Anyway, it took the contaminants off my car and make it as smooth as glass. I can tell from using it that it was smoothing out the surface of the car in seconds! And it was fun! I took the time and did my car in less than an hour and it's look great ever since."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "When researching what to do to make my car paint smooth as glass, I found this clay kit.  Works wonders, especially on weathered finishes.  Test your paint surface for roughness (everyone's has some) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint.  If it feels rough, which it should, then Meguiar's Clay Detailer is the cure!  Using the spray as a lubricant, the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which cannot be removed by washing alone (tar, etc.).  I love it!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Never did this type of detailing to my cars before and was introduced to it by a friend.After getting the hang of using a clay bar on vehicle it is a truly impressive thing to see as it strips off all the junk our cars seem to accumulate over time and gets off the stuff that harms paint and makes it both LOOK and FEEL horrible!For the money both this kit and the Mothers are a great deal and even though it only has 2 clay bars there is plenty  to get the job done on a few cars for sure! You should definetly get a refill bottle of the detail spray since it needs to be applied liberally when doing the clay bar process. Having a gallon jub handy is good to do since you cant let this stuff dry out during the job!Cant say enough about this system of cleaning your car off from all the oxidation and grime that builds up over the years!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "So many people who clean their own cars never clay (most never heard of it).  It's so simple to do, just once every few months do a clay of your car. This kit is great, because it includes a bottle of Quik Detailer. You spray the Quik Detailer, rub the clay, and *bam* watch your car shine.If you want to save money, you could just buy the clay seperately and use some sort of liquid.  Clay does require a liquid application in order to work.  But if you just want to save hassle and get it all in one shot, do this.  Then you can figure out how to save money after you've got the hang of claying."}

After opening it brand new out of the blister pack, I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel.

Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.

I use it for an air pump and a very powerful camp light.Note, most lighter plugs are limited to around 10 amps by fuse or circuit breaker in addition they have long run of small (higher resistance) wire to the jack which 'may' cause a voltage drop to your equipment.Short of 'hard wiring directly' this is the next best thing.This has none of that and of course it's the same as hooking directly to the battery so know what you are doing (sparks, load, polarity, fingers)...You might also want to pick up a heavy duty male to female ciggy plug extension cord..."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this to use with a Vivair air compressor that draws about 15A.  It will work off some accessory sockets, my bimmer works for instance, but not for very long without the engine running.  In my truck, the amp draw is high for the accessory socket and it is only active with the engine running.  This is a bit of a pain when you want to check and air up your tires.  So I clip this to the battery terminals and I am good to go.  The clips are not huge but work fine for me and the construction overall is fine.  It is nothing very fancy but it is well worth the modest price IMHO."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery's voltage. Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac (with engine running) as well. It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery, bypassing the car's fuses."}

It had the best cleaning power and was the least harsh of the car washes that you could get at the auto parts store. After using Mothers, I think I will be switching car wash soaps. This soap actually made it easier for me to dry the car! As the label states, I was able to achieve a dry, spot-free car with fewer passes of the towel as compared to the Meguiar's, which took more passes.Make the switch. I know I will."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Are you kidding me...the bubblegum smell is awesome!When paired with warm water and a decent wash mitt, this product does seem to loosen up dirt and bugs and makes cleaning rather easy.I've been using this product for years and haven't had any complaints until I left my car inside my warehouse and used the acetylene torch to do some metal cutting. The fallout from the torch stuck to the car like glue and nothing has been able to take it off except for a product called Super Gloss Ultimate.Unfortunately, the Super Gloss Ultimate is extremely hard to find, but for those interested it can be purchased at iShoptogive.com. No, it's not a car wash soap, it's a wax."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "I've used every kind of wax and polish there is and this Mag and Aluminum Polish works great on wheels. It will add shine and luster to polished aluminum wheels where they have faded or tarnished a bit. I use it by hand but you could use it with a buffer if your wheels are really tarnished.I would not recommend it for highly polished wheels or aluminum, for that I recommend Mother's Billet Polish. The difference between the two Mother's polishes is the amount of abrasive and cleaners in each one. If your wheels or aluminum parts are in really good shape, the Billet Polish will give them a mirror finish, the Mag and Aluminum Polish will probably slightly dull the finish. If the wheels or aluminum parts have lost their shine then I would recommend the Mag and Aluminum Polish. There is a big difference between the two but not detailed enough on Mother's website."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My new Accord didn't respond well to Windex, the so-called &#34;supreme&#34; glass cleaner.  I thought something was wrong with my window, being coated with oil or something. Not the case once I determined Windex = pure junk after trying this Mothers' glass cleaner.  Wow!  What it cleaned perfectly without any streaks at all, even with using cheap paper towels.  So if you're frustrated with poor quality glass cleaning because of Windex or some other junk cleaner, don't hesitate to click and buy !  It's rarely in stores by the way."}

Great product and I hope to be able to save some bucks not having to replace batteries as often, not to mention that I can hop on my Harley and take off at a moment's notice...  I plan to use it on my boat marine battery too.....  I may order the 4-up model to be able to keep multiple batteries alive at the same time...."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Of all the battery chargers on the market, the Battery Tender is the best.  The device is small and portable, works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge (over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery).  It is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use.  The Battery Tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle/mower/etc. or not.  Highly recommended. I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is the Cadillac of battery chargers.  I put my Miata on the charger each winter.  Doesn't overcharge the battery, doesn't dry out the cells, just works perfectly.  It will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days.  At this low amperage it isn't ideal for this, but it will work.This is about $50.  A new battery is about $100.  Leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time (months) kills the battery.  Do the math and you see you can't afford not to have one."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is perfect.  It comes with some small alligator clamps and also comes with wires that can be more permanently installed.  It charges and cycles the battery so it won't overcharge.  Cord lengths are long enough and the unit has a nice led system to tell you what it is doing.  This is exactly what I needed for my car which sometimes spends a few weeks in the garage without being used.  Tired of coming home from business trips to a dead battery that needs to be jumped (then replaced)."}

Make sure that the jumper cable negative and positive are not touching each other"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I got this to plug in to my lawn mower a few weeks till spring to make sure the battery had a good charge, since I had to use a motorcycle to jump it earlier in the winter, to see if it worked after I bought it (came with the house). This Battery Tender did the job. I plugged it in for a few weeks, and then when it came time to start up the mower, it had no issues.The small size of the unit is a plus, as it is easy to store when not in use."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I doubt this thing needs another 5-star review on top of the thousand it already has but just to chime in, this product is great: simple, easy to setup and understand and comes with more parts and connectors than you probably need.I have this paired with an Odyssey battery (B0000BYEXOand it was no trouble, straight out of the box.  Plugged it in, attached it with clips (there are other options here, but the clips seemed easiest) and it started charging.  I checked back a bit later and it was in \"Storage\" mode and nothing exploded so all happy on that front.I was surprised that something this small and inexpensive could be such a nice battery charger and tender."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have a 2000 Mustang GT convertible that I keep garaged and drive on nice,sunny days. I had been using a cheap trickle charger from Harbor Freight. Recently I discovered the battery had died so I decided it was time for a &#34;real&#34; charger. The reviews were great so I decided to give it a try. It is a small but powerful unit. It took  my battery from stone dead  to a full charge within 24 hours and it automatically maintains a full charge. It uses LED lights to let you know the status of your battery. I wish it had a gauge instead of the lights but I still would highly recommend this to friends and family."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Never lost a battery to winter low temperatures/forgetting to charge it since I got this.  I peer thru a garage door window occasionally to check that it's little LED light is green, and that's it.  I chose this brand because it doesn't drain your battery if the power goes off.  We have power outages here from time to time, and our old wiring has had some bad connections show up in our house's history, so I didn't want that worry.Chose the Plus model because I'm using it on a size 27 or 29 (can't recall which) deep cycle battery.  It took a long while charging when the battery was 50% discharged, but it does do it - no need to fast charge the battery first with another charger."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Purchased the battery tender to maintain a full, healthy charge on my vehicle and generator batteries. My vehicles and generator don't get used very often, so i'm really hoping this product extends the life and performance of my batteries. Since it has arrived, I've been very impressed with it's performance. This product is much smaller and safer than any other charger/tender I've yet to come across. Keep in mind that this is a trickle charger, charging only 1.25amps per hour, so it does take some time to properly charge a battery. As the instructions annotate, it will NOT charge a totally dead battery (for safety reasons). This is defined as a battery with 3V or less charge, per the manual. It goes on to explain that when this is the case, the battery is likely defective and needs to be tested/replaced. Overall, very happy with this purchase. Only thing that could've made me happier would be if it was made in America."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you have one of the millions of GM pick ups with the base mirrors these are a reasonable add on for towing.  They are easy to install after some practice.  Easy to remove - not sure why some other reviewers had problems with this...  Just unscrew the clamp and slide them off.  They are a little tough to adjust because you need to move the mirror beyond where you want it and let it snap back a bit. Just takes a little time.  Once adjusted they stayed put. They are stable on the highway but on bumpy roads they cause my OEM mirror glass to vibrate more than the add ons.  This is probably due to the extra weight of these.  You will definitely want to take them off when you are not towing.  They make your truck look like Dumbo and people will bump them in parking lots.  Best price by far was Amazon when I bought them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Our Chevy truck has chrome on the forward facing part of the mirror.  After using these mirrors for a few camping trips, it ended up getting a little scuffed.  It wasn't bad, but it was noticable.I would have taken them off after each trip, but the installation (although not overly difficult) was not easy enough for me to do so every day.As for functionality, the mirror is a little small, and although it DID give me increased visiblity, it wasn't quite what I was expecting.Maybe I was expecting too much from this mirror, but I couldn't bring myself to give it 5-stars.  I'll keep using them (especially since the chrome is already scuffed!!!), but this isn't a 5-star item."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Ok, finally have actually used this in the travel trailer.  It was a 3 day 3 night trip.  When time to empty the waste water, the smell was not nearly as bad as we were expecting(from watching youtube videos), and these porta- pak packets is why.  My sister uses a fluid deodorizer that breaks down waste and I use these.  She has tote that gallon sized thing each trip, mix it up with the correct water etc....  All you do with these is 'drop it in'.  No it doesn't add a citrus smell or cutesy smell, it just simply does what it's supposed to do.  As easy as the dishwasher gel packs....really like this product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer.  Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure.  That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex.  This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this version over the plastic version because you can connect any type of air compressor to it. The adapter is the same kind as used in car and bicycle tires.I used it last weekend to clear the water lines of my travel trailer and it worked as advertized.I initially was going to just use a bicycle pump to push the water out, but I managed to borrow an air compressor at the last minute. I blew the lines for about 30 minutes and then pumped in some RV antifreeze as recommended by my trailer manufacturer.Even though you'll only use this adapter once a year, I would recommend this over the plastic version because it should last a lifetime."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is our second Camco Fridge Airator.  The old one lasted for 7 years.  They are efficient and work well at keeping the temperature even throughout the fridge.  Rated it a three since this unit does not stay closed very well once the batteries are mounted inside.  They provide some outward pressure on the closure mechanism (pressure needed to provide battery contact).  Like the old unit, it uses plastic tabs to hold it closed.  Looks identical to the old unit (and it stayed closed), so maybe just a problem with this particular unit's tabs?  Not a deal breaker, as I put an elastic band around it to make sure it stays closed while were driving down the road."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have two sewer connections on my trailer, so I initially wasn't sure what to do.  The first two trips I just connected up the hoses to the Y connected and then had to \"milk\" the contents into the sewer.  This was not fun.  This product almost completely eliminates that horrible process and keeps things flowing downhill.  I actually purchased two - one for each sewer connection.  This keeps the elevation correct to the Y connector.  After that, the site was pretty level, so there wasn't much of a problem.I've only used these once, so I cannot comment on longevity, but I would likely replace them if they break sooner than later."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Trivia:  You can't have a sewer hose on the ground in Oregon.  It must be elevated!Betcha didn't know that, but what the heck!  It's always nice to have your \"stuff\" run downhill into the dump station instead of just sitting there in the hose!  Some people (Joe Flatlanders) carry a rain gutter to accomplish the same thing, but is a rain gutter collapsible into a nice little package with a handle?Word to the wise:  NEVER leave you black tank gate valve open!  It's ok to leave your gray tank open but NEVER leave your blank tank valve open!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This sewer hose support compresses to about one foot or will stretch out to match the length of a fifteen or twenty-foot hose. A convenient plastic carrying handle holds the assembly together for easy transport and storage. Using this support to keep the sewer hose off the ground can provide a smooth slope from the RV to the campsite sewer connection to ensure a continuous, efficient flow of the effluent without pooling that could freeze in cold weather and cause backups.  Raising your sewer hose with this assembly also makes it less likely that someone will step on it.  It's made of lightweight plastic which, if handled roughly, will snap.  But with reasonable care it should provide many years of useful service."}

There was a marked improvement in the taste of the water when using this filter.We will replace this filter at the end of the season with a new one.Recommended!CFH"}

Have been in RV Resorts to overnight spaces and so far everything has been fine."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a good value and it's useful.  It's a one time set up and then hopefully it will help get the job done over and over.  I've purchased two of these.  one for a Pop UP camper I've owned since 2008 and the other for an Airstream camper we acquired in July.  For winterizing I also use the  Camco 36143 RV Blow Out Plug with Brass Quick Connect (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XL2IEA/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i01) also available through Amazon Prime.

{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this in my KZ Spree 19' travel trailer to winterize the plumbing myself.The instructions are clear, the fittings are correct and fit well with no leaks.It took me no more than 15 minutes to install this kit, which is then left in place for next year saving even more time and money, and flush the plumbing with three gallons of anti-freeze.Without this kit, it would have cost twice as much to assemble my own set-up at home-depot, and taken twice as long. This is reasonably priced, shipped quickly, and is a much better alternative then filling your freshwater supply with many more gallons of coolant.Bottom line. It works well, doesn't leak, and saves time and money."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Excellent product.  Does exactly as it's supposed to.  Just don't be a moron like I was and pay attention to the direction of the arrows and think about how the water will get sucked from the bottle.  I had mine connected backwards for about 30 minutes until I figured out why it was not sucking anything from the anti-freeze bottle.  Once I corrected my mistake, it worked like a charm.  Definitely a must-have for any rv'er especially one that lives in the north."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This valve is exactly what I needed to make draining the hot water tank in my RV a breeze. Unfortunately, it arrived with a quality control problem - the T-handle was not properly crimped onto the valve shaft. The first time I tried to use the valve, the handle came right off in my hand. Rather than fool aroung with the nuisance of returning it, I reworked the crimp with a hammer & punch. I was able to make it secure enough that I can use the valve without the handle coming loose. Hopefully, it will not work loose & be lost due to vibrations on the road."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After looking online at &#34;ready-made&#34; emergency auto kits, I made up emergency bags of my own for my kids' trunks, just in case the MN roads got the best of them.  The pre-made kits were either too expensive and filled with the cheapest junk, or they just didn't have an intelligent assortment of things I know people need (from experience).  Many of those kits were labeled by AAA.  So, strangely when I went looking for a first aid kit with something more than band-aids and rubber gloves (who really needs those, anyway?), I found this, complete with gauze and tape and stuff you need in the real-world if you get stuck, stranded, or hurt.  I wanted to go a little bigger with other things like peroxide and cold compress, but it was cheaper to buy those separately and just go with this kit."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My intention was to have a minimal first aid kit for the car.  This little pack is reasonably well constructed, small, and even has belt loops (that I'll never use, but a great thought).  It's not going to handle major trauma, but for the occassional bandage, insect sting, wound cleaning, or field dressing, it's what you need.  There's enough extra room in the case to add two or three more items to personalize the assortment.  The contents are packaged in 3 mini zip-lock baggies, and there are common refills available for it all."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I only had a set of small metal chocks that came with the floor jack I have so I went with a chock with a little more size. I bought these and am very happy with them. A nice bright red/orange color for visibility, comes with a small rope loop to hang on the wall or pull out from tire placement and sturdy construction. It has rows of ridges to hold against the tire and on the bottom to prevent slipping. I'm sure the bottom ridges will work on soft surfaces but I'll have to wait until I use them to see if they slip or not on concrete / hard surfaces. I recommend this product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this wheel chock to prevent my truck from slipping down an icy roadway during freezing weather at my mountain cabin.  I have to park on the road above my cabin during inclement weather because my driveway is too iced up to drive on.  This roadway has an incline and in the past,  my truck slid backwards on the ice after putting the truck in park and setting the parking brake.  I put this wheel chock behind the rear tire and it keeps my truck from sliding on the ice.  The nice thing about the strap on the wheel is the wheel chock usually freezes to the road during the night and I can pull it loose when I need to remove the chock.This chock is expensive, but worth the extra expense and I am going to order another one so both wheels are chocked"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I always have about 3 packs of JB weld different places in my house because i have found it can be a very good problem fixer. Be sure to use it in applications where your safety will not be compromised. I have recently used it to fix my MTD lawn mower blade adapter. The adapter has a little notch a 1/4\" thick that keeps the adapter and blade spinning on the engines crankshaft. after several years of use the notch sheared off, i used JB weld to put it back on with a small amount on the sheared part and a small long bead lengthwise on the sides. The mower is now back in action and saved me from buying a new adapter."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I love JB Weld and use it probably once a month.  Some recent projects where I've used JB Weld is to repair a set of my wife's ear rings, my daughter's music box with little ballerina dancers (one of which broke off), and my son's toy motorcycle.  The most money saving repair I've done with this is to adhere the plastic anti-lock break sensor into the middle of the hub of the back wheel on my 2003 Toyota Sienna--I would have needed to replace the entire hub and that would have cost $300+ probably just for parts!  It needed to be able to take extreme temperatures and JB Weld did the trick.To apply, I use a scrap piece of cardboard to mix it on, I split off a piece of shim (or a popsicle stick would work too) to use as a stir stick and applicator, and fix away."}

I recommend a type with a hose for versatility. The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications. If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100. This is not for all applications. Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "So I bought this to replace my 20 year old, kicked around, same version of this gauge.  I had suspected my old one was not reading properly.  So I got this new one.  I am happy to report that the 20 year old one reads exactly the same as this new one.  So now I have a spare to keep in my other car.  The only thing I don't like about this model vs the old one is my old one had a little release valve. So it holds the needle where the pressure reading was till you press the release.  Very handy.  And it was my fault for not noticing it wasn't there on this new version.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with this product.  If you have a car, and have tires, and want them to last, having the correct tire pressure matters."}

Then I ordered this stuff because I wanted a better product and I trust Meguiar's. I was immediately impressed right out of the jug. This cleans very well and does not streak at all. It is priced right for sure, I would probably pay $30 for the gallon. Pick up a spray bottle and you're in business for a while with this detailer. You can use it on windows and basically every surface of your car. It takes me 10 minutes to clean my whole car now, amazing."}

This stuff does not leave any smears but only if you use it under the sun it does and its very easy to wipe clean.

Very slippery finish and looks almost as good as carnubawax which only lasts 4-6 weeks. great labor and paint saver. I also usedit on my windshield and other exterior glass. I thinks it's much easier towork with than Rain X and does a similar job. My 2004 Lexus RX330 looksgreat and cleans easily as nothing sticks to Rejex."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product provides some serious protection. Not only is it a durable sealant, it's tendency to sheet water off reduces the likilihood of Type II water spots.Also nice is the relatively fast cure time.  In only eight hours, RejeX is stable enough that a second can be added.  Some sealants require 36 hours.  This makes RejeX far more convenient.As others have noted you have to apply this product very thinly.  If you don't you'll get a real good workout huffing it off.  The best application method requires a DA polisher because you can lay down a very thin coat easily.Applied properly, you'll need very little to do your car.  I need less than ounce to do my pickup."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "These work as advertised but don't do anything particularly special.  Best part is just tossing them out when you're done.  No lint, unlike paper towels, so it works great to leave your interior surfaces clean without residual lint that can look really bad or embarrassing.  This product just cleans without any oil or gloss left over so that's great too as I dislike having greasy finishes that can reflect badly in the sun.  Need to make sure you keep these stored indoors out of the sun else they could dry up on you.I would suggest buying these when they're discounted such as subscribe and save @ 20% to maximize your savings."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Going from a diesel pusher back to a 5th wheel I was already getting grief as to how much more movement of the RV would be felt over that of the diesel pusher while raised up on the leveling system.Not being new to the 5th wheel movement and shaking when parked and people moving around inside I ordered this as I have used one in the past.  While a 5th wheel king pin stabilizer will not eliminate all of the movement it does greatly reduce the movement.It is easy to assemble, easy to use though a little on the heavy side.  But, then with weight comes strength I guess.  I have tried it out and am pleased with the improvements it has given.Amazon had the best price I could locate after an extensive internet shopping for price including shipping.  And of course there is that great customer service and return policy Amazon offers should you experience a problem.Over all I give it two thumbs up for performance and value."}

Still cheaper than any retail store on the planet.Secondly, when I tried to employ this, it was quickly apparent that 60\" wa'nt tall enough.  Since I used up all of my leveling blocks to level the 5th wheel, I couldn't use any to raise this up to be tall enough to support my king pin.If this would have had just a couple more inches... every man's dream!Guess I just have to get another stack of leveling blocks.

Install was a total PITA!! The bolts holes used to mount the hitch itself were rusted to no end (2005 MDX) and the ONLY way for me to get the bolts in was to use one of the old ones that held up the tow hook you remove and using that as a thread cutter with WD-40... I also used an old round plastic brush and brushed the threads with lubricant as well!! Install took almost 5 hours due to this unforeseen problem."}

I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The only thing I have against scissor jacks is that after they have been raised to the height prior to having to level my 31' RV, it requires quite a hefty force to raise it for leveling. The included socket and turn handle had the pin break at the socket and I had to improvise with an icepick for a temporary repair. A Camco socket that I purchased also for using fit perfect, but a 3/8\" drill wanted to burn out tring to raise the jacks. I plan to use something more powerful next time. I'd like to see some gearing on the crank to make the jack raise easier when leveling my rv. THe Jack does have the strength and ability to take the weight without any problem."}

Yet the factory horn sounds almost as robust as the horn in the 1966 VW bus my family had when I was a kid.  \"Meep meep.\"  Note I said the Hyundai horn was ALMOST as robust as the '66 VW.  I think the VW horn had a little more oomph.  What was Hyundai thinking??I found a Hyundai tech to swap the original Hyundai/Kia P.O.S. horn with this item and the results are awesome.

{"label": 2, "raw": "Tried it on my 2007 Aveo with no known problems. It detected zero codes. Hooked it up to my 2000 Sienna with a check light and it prompted a code(PO0135) to replace my oxygen sensor. Did that and rechecked it with no codes. You need a code reader instead of replacing every sensor! How do you erase the codes with the erase button? I tried with the erase button with no avail. I ended up just disconnecting the negative battery cable for five minutes. I replaced the battery cable and started the van up. Low and behold, No More Check Engine Light. This small entry level, pocket size code reader did the job. The OB-2 hook up for the van is under the dash near the steering wheel.

{"label": 2, "raw": "I received one of these years ago as a gift to clean the spokes on my bike.  It worked great and lasted over a decade.  I also used it on the wheels of my cars.  It really makes quick work of the dirt you can't reach or would spend a lot of time trying to get to.  I just replaced that old one and the new one is identical; very good quality.  Be aware that the core of the brush is a heavy twisted wire that terminates in a loop at the very end of the brush.  Be careful that you don't scratch your wheels with this exposed wire loop.  I personally never had a problem with it but am careful, being aware of the potential for scratches.  If I was designing this I would have coated the end of the wire in rubber. (thus the 4-stars)  I definitely recommend this to those who really like their vehicles clean."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This brush cleans well and is large enough to easily clean wider wheels like 8 or 9inches wide.However, the downside is that the tip of the brush has the metal spine exposed and, if you're not careful, can damage the finish of your precious wheel if you're not careful when about to put it between the spokes.You can't really tell that from the pictures, and it may seem minor, but it takes a lot of thought each time you're about to clean your wheel to remember to be extra careful using it."}

I do not blame this thing for the problem, the bumper just could not handle the force of two bikes and a bike rack ( total weight about 80 lbs ) running down a bumpy road. It started to tear a hole near the weld to the frame of the trailer. Did not notice it for a few days until I could see the bike rack sagging. Don't get me wrong, this thing is built VERY solidly ( and mounts perfectly to a 4&#34; square bumper ). I am really writing this to warn others thinking of using this as I did. You really need someone to weld something to the bumper to make it stronger ( or replace the bumper with a stronger one ) before using this, or maybe use a very light bike rack with a very light bike."}

The foam started disintegrating almost immediately when run across any angle of the wheels surface.  The foam is simply too weak, it rips and shreds.  I would only use this on very smooth surfaces that have no angles to them, ridges, bumps, etc.  But if you're polishing something that simple in shape - you don't need this in the first place.  Grab a rag and you'll be done a lot faster."}

It cuts through brake dust that soap wont even touch.however you cant really just leave it on for 30 seconds and spray it off. if the cleaner sits on one area too long, it begins to dry, and leaves behind residue. I find its best to use a couple sprays of this on a sponge with a liberal dose of water. Rinse quickly, do multiple scrub downs if needed.

Again I always use a brush to get into the nooks and crannies.Overall I love it, will buy more, but like others have said it doesn't go far. I have about 1/3 left after doing two cars. They really need to make a bulk jug so I can just refill the applicator bottle. Since I scrub the tires anyway I may adjust the amount I use.

I can get it off by sanding further with fine grit sandpaper and then polishing with metal polish, but it's really annoying.That being said, it really cleans your tires and wheels well. Better than &#34;Bleche White&#34; for sure, but I will probably stop using it for my car because of the metal corrosion issue."}

Not only is it pH balanced to ensure that you don't damage the finish of various wheels you may clean, its cleaning power is second to none. If you have a vehicle that generates a lot of brake dust (BMW, namely, but other vehicles that have fade-resistant brakes), you can spray P21S on the wheel wipe around with the provided sponge let sit for a few minutes and spray off and they'll look good as new. I occasionally (~50k miles) take off the wheels and clean the caked on stuff on the inside of the rim, too. It takes a bit more scrubbing but cleans it to make it look new every time. If you can't get this stuff to take whatever you have on your wheel, you will likely need to refinish the wheel - this stuff is the very best!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "For those that are still using the old pencil/plunger type of gauge, I would suggest to change to this digital gauge. Not only you get very accurate readings to 1/2 lb psi, but the ease of use is just amazing. You push with the very ergonomic design on the tire valve and the air-tight seal is easily maintained to get a reading. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it doesn't have a protrusion to bleed air if you over inflate the tires. No big deal, I just use a pointed tool such as a philips screw driver to bleed air."}

Learn to use the gauge properly and you'll make a good seal easily each time.  Not perfect, but good.Today, I see that AMAZON.COM is selling this for less than $10 so I am picking up an extra one just to have it handy (this one will sit next to my air compressor tank at home).EXCELLENT item.Highly recommended."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Didn't notice the backlit feature when buying it so that was an unexpected bonus, and a very useful one at that.  This gauge pushes onto the stem very easy and securely feeling. It's very easy to read. I compared it to an old digital gauge I still use, my long-time favorite because it's so easy and reliable, and this one had exactly the same results.  The only slight inconvenience is that the reading doesn't lock on so that could pull it off of the stem to see, you must read while it's still on.  And then due to the shape you have to be a little on the one side to read it.  Really minor inconveniences, it's still very easy to use and seems to be very accurate and consistent.  Will probably pick up one or two more for other cars."}

That and the fact the common rail injected 2 liter motor runs much smoother now and has a noticable power increase has made me smile. As far as better gas milage, maybe a little but not significant, but, a one mile per gallon or a two mile per gallon increase is welcome when gas is at $4 dollars a gallon. My GMC pickup has not shown any increase in miles per gallon. The additive has smoothed out that Vortec motor well. I am a regular now.

It actually outlasts regular paste waxes.Pros:-Awesome durability for a spray wax-Real wax looks, great depth and warm glow-Super easy to use-Smells great-A little goes a LONG way, use sparinglyCons:-streaks when used on a hot car, though this really isn't a con, its more of a DUH.-streaks if you use too much, again, is that really a con?This is a huge value, while it appears it is more expensive than a regular spray wax, it goes twice as far easily, and I bet most people are used to using way more, and thus get streaking.  I'd estimate I get twenty, yes 2-0 cars per bottle.  Great stuff, my favorite spray wax for dark colors."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I also have a dark colored car that I used this on and did have some streaking. By re-applying another coat (being careful not to put too much on) corrected the problem as suggested by other reviewers. While the car really shines (I used a clay bar and detailer beforehand), the finish this product leaves is not slippery as regular waxes. This really isn't a problem, just don't expect a slick surface when you are done. I think the more I use it, the more I will like it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product."}

The correct size and part # was on the receipt/invoice when they arrived (19 days later), but they sent covers for a 13\" wheel (I needed 28\"). When I contacted Amazon, they said my size was no longer available so they sent these. Are you kidding me??? 13\" covers for 28\" wheels!! Who made this decision...a monkey?So I sent it back for a refund. I couldn't tell if the covers were good quality, cause I never opened the box. What a major let down after waiting almost 3 weeks. I went to a local camper store and got a set there the next day. Sometimes, saving a few bucks just ain't worth it!!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use this little charger solely for one purpose. My Corvette sits in the garage and is mostly taken to shows rather than being an everyday car. The Corvette has an issue that sometimes causes a battery discharge especially if left sitting for quite some time. I checked with the car dealer and we found an identical issue with a brand new one sitting on the display floor. Sometimes it is no more than a light or switch left on. In any event this little charger will maintain my battery so that when I do try to start the Corvette I have full battery power. It is not for charging  a dead battery. It has worked well fro me and the price is right. Cord are long enough to reach from my electrical outlet to the fuse box on the Corvette where the connection is made. Great little addition to my garage."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "There is absolutely nothing to set on this charger. You connect it and you wait for it to charge a battery.  It is one of the few that I have seen that will automatically detect 6 and 12 volt batteries and I have about a dozen different kinds of chargers.  It also detects reverse polarity and the little lights are easy to see and interpret.  The clips it comes with are better than the usual kind being shaped for more effective gripping of terminals and larger.The product literature claims it has tempreature compensation and desulphation, but I have not verified either by actual tests."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a great little unit... I actually own 4 of them.  I use them to maintain the batteries on my two motorcycles, the lawn tractor and my Porsche over the winter.  They are connect and forget, which is great.  Since they employ \"float charging\" there's no danger of overcharging a battery which can happen if you leave a regular battery charger connected too long.  I wouldn't recommend one of these to bring a fully discharged battery back to life since the charging output is so low, I'd use a regular battery charger instead.  But these units are great for their designed purpose and that is to \"maintain\" a battery during periods of inactivity.  I've had no problems with any of my 4 units.  By-the-way, you can also use the Deltran cables with this Schumacher unit.  Deltran also makes battery tenders and their extension and various connection cables are easier to find."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use it for my Motor scooter, it has a very small 12 volt battery. The small rings in the box fit perfectly (I left them mounted to the battery in the scoot). The quick disconnect is a really nice feature. I ran the battery down once (left the black cable off after maintenance and forgot to connect the schumacher, my bad...). The small scooter batteries are notorious for not holding a charge. When I reattached the cable, I reattached the unit and it recharged it in a few hours. It then kept it charged till the spring. I'm very happy with this unit."}

Positive alligator clip got close to inner hood liner and burned. Flamed up. Burnt the red plastic boot off and if i didn't blow the liner out (I freaked!), my vehicle would have gone poof! Pilot error? Bad design? Who knows.Edit: Just called Schumacher and they're replacing it, no problem. Upping my rating from a ** to ***. Thanks Schumacher."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "So far this battery charger is working very well have the unit about 6 months for a battery for a riding mower. I have been buying a battery every year so I thought I would try one of these units to see if it would make the battery last longer. I always took the battery out of the mower in the winter and placed it in the basement and had to charge it in the spring, but it's seamed that the battery would not last all year or the season anyway. I will find out this spring if it does work."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've bought two of these through Amazon and I may buy another.  I use them on my lawn tractor and standby generator battery for winter maintenance, and on one of our cars that doesn't get driven very often.  At the price, they are cheaper than some of the smaller encapsulated trickle chargers.  They have worked great for me on batteries from lead-acid automotive types to gel cells.  If you're looking for a battery maintainer with a little more power to charge, this is the one.  Remember, today's vehicles with clocks, navigation systems, and other electronics may draw more than a small trickle charger can provide.  This charger at 1.5A can provide enough power to compensate for electronics that draw extra power even while off."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this to charge the battery on my 99 Lexus GS400.  The battery has gone dead a couple times and I was ready to buy a replacement but thought I would get this and try it.  Its a battery re-born!  Works like new now... this lil baby does a great job of slow charging and also tells you the battery percentage.  Its made well, very compact and is asthetically pleasing to the eye.  I also love that it has storage in the back to put the cables/clips for storage.If you need a battery charger...this is THE one to get!Buy with confidence!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The product I just received from Amazon today is the more basic/generic ANCO wiper blade (31-series; same as available locally at walmart for less $). Don't buy this product expecting an AeroVantage blade, which is a premium model; you likely won't get it. I should have verified the ANCO part number before purchase. The cheap wiper blade is model 31-28, whereas an AeroVantage blade is 91-28. The listing title needs to be fixed.That said, I've used these cheaper ones in the past, and they're decent. Haven't had problems with them, and they've been at least as good as any other cheap wiper blade.Another odd note: I ordered several of these, and each came in its own shipping box. I don't know why they couldn't have been packed together, but they weren't."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Like all Bosch automotive products, this wiper blade is well designed and does its job extraordinarily well. It uses the standard hook attachment method for wiper arms, and fits snugly (installed on my '00 Accord). When researching wiper blades, I found that the newer \"mono\" style of wiper blade do not quite compare to this standard design, as the newer, more bulkier Rain-X style tend to catch the wind and thus skip spaces on the windshield. I found mine on sale at a local Autozone for $13."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Sometimes I wish my car was BIGGER, just so I could wax even MORE of it with Meguiar's A-2216 Deep Crystal Carnuba Wax.This is a labor of love, (but not a frustrating exercise in removing powdered wax from trim and other areas, like it can be when you use other brands of car waxes). I find that using a spray bottle of water and lightly spritzing that portion of the car that I am Meguiar-waxing makes the shine even more intense.I usually wax the car twice, to get a very deep shine -- the first day I let the new wax coat settle, then the second day, hose down the car, dry it and Meugiar-Wax it again, for a beautiful deep finish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "this product is as good as the turtle platinun, carnauba mother step 3. and the price is lower and equal quality of the three brands, the brightness of the car depends on the quality of the painting and not the wax. for this reason the high prices of other products can not be justified, after several years of experience in this field I recommend Meguiar carnauba step 3, I recommend waxing every month depending on weather and if the car is exposed or not the sun .. or every two weeks and has not so abrasive that can be used many times as you want."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been using Mequiar's Quik Detailer for years and it is still the best product I've found.  I've tried other brands including new ones to the market place, and this is still the leader.  One thing I really like about it is if I miss a spot, a quick spray and the surface is consistent in shine and appearance.  Some of the other sprays would be totally dependent on how much product you used, so I would have to go back and keep blending until the difference wasn't noticeable."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased Meguiar's Gold Class Carnauba Plus Wax to use on an old Corvette I purchased. The car's finish was in pretty good shape despite being 22 years old. Since the paint was original, I didn't want anything to harsh, and I wanted to do it by hand. Much to my surprise, Meguiar's Gold Class Carnauba Plus Wax made the car look almost like new. The paint color is black, and it shines like a mirror. When my neighbor saw my car, he asked if I had it repainted. Besides looking great, the wax was also easy to get on and off. I really can't think of anything negative to say about it other than it costs more than most waxes. But in this case, you definitely get what you pay for. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This was extremely easy to use.  I would do one side of the car and do the next while waiting for it to dry.  Then buff with a microfiber towel and you're good to go.  Came with an applicator, but I used my own pads.  I will keep that one with the tin if I'm ever in a pinch.  It left a great shine on the car that even still exists 2 weeks later after a trip across 2 states during some rain storms.  The only blemishes are the bugs I hit along the way.  Also, I have to park my car outside in the elements.  excellent wax!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I never thought of using paste wax, I used the liquid version of this wax, I was very pleased with the results, but the paste was way easier to use. The container comes with an application sponge which can be stored in the tin. It was less messy than liquid, I can never go back to a liquid now. I'm not sure about the durability of the wax, but since I use a spray wax regularly and a good detailer.....dirt has no chance of stickin to my car's paint.I will buy this wax again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If I could bathe in this stuff, I probably would. I've used dozens of car shampoos over the last 20 years or so, and this Meguiar's Gold Class is definitely the best. It doesn't take much to get a nice cleansing foam going, and once you do, it applies and washes with an ultimate smoothness that I haven't been able to find with other soaps. And not that it matters, but it's also got a really great scent, which is a nice little bonus when you'd rather be doing other things besides washing your car."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Just washed my car for the first time since I've owned it (7 years). I've taken it through the washes, etc. but never WASHED it. So this shampoo is really good along with the special washing mitt. There is enough here for my grandchildren (had I ever had children but that is a total 'nuther story) at 4 capfuls per wash. I also used the clay by the same company, and their water magnet towel, and their shiner towels. I cannot speak highly enough! I am so very glad I bought this for what it was going to cost me for half the job a few blocks away. GET THE CLAY."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "So I pour in a good amount and mix it with water. In the bucket there is a lot of suds, but then when I apply it to the car, the suds don't carry over.To me, soap is just soap, however this soap has a nice smell to it.It doesn't remove dirt or debris any better than the next soap, however I used to use Rain X with Carnauba wax, and that was a great car wash soap. It left my car shiny after washing and this -- I have to wax it after. I bought this at Costco for like 12 dollars, and it lasted me quite a while. I wouldn't go back to this as it doesn't wax my car. Also -- it dries fairly quickly for some reason and leaves a soap residue."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff is good for cleaning and leaving a nice long lasting shine especially on dark vehicles ex: black, dark grey, red etc. Some reviews are correct is saying it doesn't hold suds, but you must understand that this product contains conditioners which will do that. Its best to use a bottle attached sprayer \"on hose\" with solution in it. This will make suds, suds, but want last as again it has conditioners in it. Product smells like hair shampoo, gold color doesn't make paint change in appearance either, some products after long use stays attached because of wax buildup can make your vehicle appear to look the color of stuff you are using. Good stuff, way better than Mothers. If it doesn't clean like you need then go get a bottle of blue dawn detergent."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a fantastic conditioner -- but a cleaner, it is not. At least, not more than surface dirt and dust. That, however, was fine for my purpose (new leather with nothing more than some surface dirt). It goes on easily, smells great but is not an overpowering scent, and leaves the leather looking nice, dark and clean without any ridiculous shine or slippery feel.I didn't really find it difficult to apply, but it may be a little messy. I just dedicate one cloth for application, do the whole car, and then use another 2 cloths to go back around and wipe up the excess. Takes about 15 minutes on my Nissan. I still prefer Lexol for cleaning and conditioning, but this is a great product for monthly application to protect against UV exposure, which is what I am looking for."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have tried products from Chemical Guys and Surf City and etc. They all look great but don't last.  This product, having driven around in snow, salt, and sand for the past three days, is still holding up.  I am very impressed.  But, it is very glossy.  So if you are not a fan of super shiny tires, after applying the product with a foam applicator, wait 10 minutes and wipe your tires down with a towel.  That should take the edge off the shine.  This stuff also drys pretty well too.  I have used this around the house on all things plastic/rubber/vinyl and in the car and on the trim.  So far so good. I like it it a lot.  This is not a water based product. In any event, I do not know how it compares to other oil/silicon based tire shine products.  There are no shortage of them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product is great on tires!!!! It's not runny and sticks well to the tires. For some reason it smells great to? Anyhow, wear some latex gloves and use a sponge like applicator to apply the gel. After a couple uses your tires will have soaked it in to the point that you will only need to use a dirty rag to wipe the dust and grime off the tires and they will actually still have a shine!!

{"label": 2, "raw": "excellent product, i tried several products on my rims, this really does the job well, i sprayed it liberally to rims wells and outside used brush only on inside wells , but didn't have to brush the outside of the rim, and the rim became  totally clean with just water hose rinse, strong but yet no complications from the product, what i mean is that i noticed its safe on the rims.the only disadvantage is that the bottle was enough for one time clean only, so for proper clean i think you needs 2 bottles, if you want to clean properly including the wells behind the spokes."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use it on every wash that I do.If your a car guy and keep your vehicles nice this is a great product.If your working on a vehicle that has been abused it may take you two or three times to get the wheels looking good.You may have to scrub the wheels by hand to clean off the real dirty areas, and possibly use tar and or bug remover to get them nice and clean.But once you do that, from there in all you need to do is wash the wheels down, spray the wheel cleaner on and let it sit for a few minutes and pressure wash it off. No need to hand wash.And the wheels look really nice."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Yes it is a water magnet;however like another reviewer said, it's so magnetic where it won't let the water go no matter however many times you wring it. Sure drops will come off, but the potency of drying will not be at 100% as if the towel was completely dry. I would recommend a chamois or an absorber, they seems to wring out water alot better as well as soak water up. Just figure out a technique. And victory will be yours. So the case of the drying water magnet, I'll give it a four since it does what it's title says. And a bit easier to use than the chamois. But you get what you pay for."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "As soon as you finish one panel of your car, you move the towel around to find tons of dry areas waiting to soak up water! This microfiber feels very thick and I can dry half the car without wringing the towel out. I definitely felt the price was a bit steep before purchasing, but they're much better than any OTC microfibers, which can be very thin and require multiple wrings to dry your car.The yellow color of the towel makes it easy to see any pieces of debris in the towel if you are wiping off wax and it dries after a few minutes of being hung. Great investment if you're looking for a car-only towel!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use these to dry the car and also I have one that I use to apply the Meguiar Ultimate Detailer in between wash/waxes.These work well for both purposes, though you may need more than 3 for drying the car as they don't hold a huge amount of water.While I like them and they have held up well to heavy use and a few rounds of washing/drying in the laundry, there may be better values out there for microfiber cloths.I recently picked up Zwyper cloths on a lightning deal -- these may be a better microfiber cloth value if you can find them in a reasonably large size -- or another less established brand (maybe Amazon Basics makes them?)"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "At about 3 bucks a piece they are an excellent buy. As all the other 5 star reviews have noted, they are soft and versatile. They do an amazing job on windows and mirrors. They are 16x24.I rated them 5 stars because they are excellent and an excellent value too.If you are looking for the next level, or you really want something dedicated to just babying your paint job, then these Cobra towels (  Cobra Miracle Towel 6 Pack ***NEW*** ) are pretty awesome. These towels run about $7.80 each with shipping, they're plusher, 70/30 towels and although they are the same size, 16x24, they seem a lot bigger and they feel much nicer.Darin"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I find these to be perfect for removing wax, their cloth pattern traps all the dried wax and makes it an enjoyable taskThe problem is that it is too expensive in my opinion.Con:They get too dirty too fast, if you happen to go to say the desert I doubt that you will be able to use just one cloth. I'd say this are strictly for detailing and not for dusting.I do use them for dusting when my car nearly has tiny dust particles, but when it is way too dusty I just wash the car.Too expensive.Pro:They go in like new mode once washed. They don't seem to be losing any efficiency, and they are large enough for multiple usesOverall These are great if you can afford 2 sets, they last a long time, and can be used anywhere! The bright yellow color helps avoid losing them or confusing them with other cloths."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product is so inferior to Griots that it is not funny. Look, Meguiar's makes great car wax products, this is probably a product they sub out and then add a make up too. It's too thin, to small, just all together beneath the reputation of Meguiar's product line. As a drying cloth not very good at all. As a wax removal cloth just not good enough. Listen if you detail your engine compartment these are just fine. If you are not a car person, these are going to be good enough for you, really. But if you are fussy about your car, wax it , detail it.... these would be the product you want to use for wheels, engines and door jams. I already own them so that is what I will use them for, same a an old house towel would be used. If that is what you are looking for , look no further, these will do.

These dont make any squeaks and clean water away from glass well even under torential Florida rain. I tried another set and they didnt fit this car, dont get the ones without the thin metal frame like these for this vehicle as the mounting area is too wide to fit wiper arms."}

They weren't the cheapest replacements out there, but they still cost under $10 so I gave them a shot. I had them installed in under 5 minutes. They fit and work perfectly. They clear my windows without streaks, and they are silent too. I give them 4 stars because I have Anco blades installed on my other Elantra, and they cost about 30% less. They also work equally as well. With that said though, I can still recommend the Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blades."}

The wiper streaked along its entire length after installation when I used my windshield washer. I'd hoped that in a heavy rain it would clean up and work well. WRONG! It got worse and my visibility was so poor that I felt that driving was dangerous. Luckily I didn't have far to go before I could change it. I've always liked the Rain-X liquid so felt that I could trust the brand. Maybe I got a bad one but I've never had this happen with other brands. I won't chance buying these again."}

Gotta love these finds.  $7.50 a blade from Amazon.In the desert the heat / Sun kills the rubber on the blades and it almost never rains.  So I always buy the cheapest blades given that I will be replacing them sooner rather than later and they need not remove snow or ice.  They just dry rot here.  BUT, I cannot find a cheap brand smaller than 15 inches locally.  So I order here and while I am paying about $1.50 more than local cheap blades, I have no choice and I get a better brand.  Oh and I don't mess with the blade refills anymore.  It just isn't worth the hassle unless you just can't afford it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "For the price, an excellent wiper. Now, I did just put them on so it depends on how long they stay good for, but so far they work very well. Why did I choose Rain-X? Because they were heavily advertised during a lot of Formula 1 races back in the day and that kinda stuck with me.NOTE: A lot of people seem to wonder what size blades fit their vehicle. Either do a quick google search, check your owner manual, or just get a tape measure and measure the length of each blade on your car. Typically the driver side blade is a bit longer by an inch or two."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used Zym&ouml;l Z503 on a newer vehicle that had minor contaminants in the finish.One characteristic that is important to note about Zym&ouml;l is that you need to be a bit more synchronized w/ its application - it dries really fast compared to other cleaner waxes I've used.This cleaner wax requires more effort to buff clean. The extra amount of elbow-grease required resulted in a superior shine.PROS:1. natural formula2. solid reputation3. provides intense 'wet' shine4. cleans off concrete easily (inevitable drip or two on the garage floor)5. smells like tropical paradiseCONS:1. very thin consistencyI'm not sure if the Zym&ouml;l Z503 is the same formula that I've used in years past, that said I'll wait a while to evaluate how long the protective finish lasts."}

If you like to double wax your car for the ultimate gloss then wipe the light 2nd coat off after a light mist from a water spray bottle and wait to be amazed. Side note prior to this I used Harley's 100% carnuba wax and it's a great product was well but the light cleaning action with today's softer clear coats makes this German wax flat out the best !"}

{"label": 2, "raw": "With the fine threading it may be stronger but doubt that this feature will make a difference. The split washer is chrome plated which is a mistake as the chroming weakens the washer and a piece off the end cracked off when I first attached the ball to a hitch.The directions state that the nut should be torqued to 450 ft. lbs. which is likely to be an error. Hard to even find a torque wrench that goes up to 450 foot lbs. much less someone who could tighten the nut to that specification without a 4 foot cheater bar."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is great car soap, no frills - no wash and wax mix - its perfect for washing before you polish and wax because it doesn't have anything but car soap in it. Not sure why it doesn't work good for other people but for me, its excellent! Also is very cost effective and made by a company with vehicle care in mind, Meguiar's have been around for a way long time and make great products! This is always my choice car wash, it always leaves the vehicle as clean as it can be with a wash alone, the real magic happens after with the polishing and waxingI've read where people say it leaves spots or what not, i have to say if you follow what it says to do in the directions, you'll be golden. And another good tidbit, when you finish washing, you need to dry it with a shammy or the like or yes, it will leave water spots - but that is not from the soap! Its from the sediments that are already in the water."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used these safety cables as a backup for the winch strap on the bow of our two personal watercraft. They are so easy to use I'm going to order more and use them to replace the safety chains on my trailers. This will save me a little time when hooking up the trailers because they simply snap onto the truck instead of having to thread the chain through and tighten up the chain link. Also they self retract so won't need to be wrapped around the trailer so they won't drag on the ground like chains.The materials and construction are good in my opinion. The price is quite reasonable too."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this kit to diagnose the hard start problem on my 96 XJ Cherokee. Took about ten minutes to figure out I had low pressure on the rail due to bleed-back. Bad check valve or pressure regulator, both of which are part of my fuel pump assembly. New assembly, problem solved! This kit worked perfect out of the box. Teflon tape on gauge fittings, pressure relief hose nice and long, very easy to use. Adapters to fit almost any car, i.e. you can rent it to your friends for five bux! Nice pouch for storage too! Has complete instructions, though they're hardly necessary."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This fuel pressure tester worked great for me.  I was able to connect it to the test port on my fuel rail and test pressure within literally about 2 min. I didn't have any help, so i was able to lay the gauge down on the windshield and watch the results as I ran several tests from the drivers seat.  Since the gauge has a rubber bumper around it, it stayed in place even when the fuel line pressurized.  I did not have any problems with leaks at the fuel pressure release button.  This tester confirmed I need a new fuel pump. I think it is the perfect balance of price, quality and functionality for the DIY'er."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Strong and well made. I recommend this product, and Prime for shipping 2-day. Very handy to have one of these, good truck fit and connection, nice there are two positions for mounting it. Though it states Made in China it seems well made. Expect the paint to come off with use, lube the hook well. The only problem I foresee is grease on the pants if you choose to leave it on, as you can't put a cover over it. Leaving it on the farthest-in position may help."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Amazon doesn't sell this plug for my Subaru.  I'm putting it here as a public service.  I had four of these in my Subaru for 50000 miles.  They worked fine.  Except one had the whole corner of the ground electrode shear off.  I don't know if it's still in the cylinder or not, but the whole corner is cleanly gone. Overall, there's not much wear on the ground electrode.  The spark was grounding almost on the side of the electrode after that part of the electrode sheared off.  Not good.  And I still wonder if I don't need to stick a magnet on a stick down the spark plug hole and try to get that piece back.Anyway, the laser iridium probably solves this as the ground electrode has a platinum disk on it."}

No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as \"Ultimate performance\" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  \"NGK spark plug finder\" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "At first I thought this was a gimmick product, but when mounted on the side and the back of our RV it gives me a simple way of knowing if my RV is relatively level.  They are small and unobtrusive (that's nice), but fairly accurate.  Both levels come with a sticky pad that's about half the size of the unit, so no screws are needed.  I'm not sure how well the sticky pads will hold up over time in the weather, but I'll update this review if needed.  I wish the sticky pads were larger, but I could always get larger pads if it becomes an issue in the future.  It's best to mount these little buggers when your RV is already level.  It's probably best to mount one directly over the wheel(s) of your trailer, but not necessary.  Overall, I am very happy with these little levels."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "These are good enough for visual rough-leveling of your camper, but they're no precion instrument.  It's tough to install these while holding them level and then sticking them down with the double-sided foam tape on the back side.  Once it's down it's down.  If you stick it on crooked, rip it off and throw it away and start over, or try to twist them level and then put in some screws to hold it there.  The foam tape will allow you to twist them back and forth."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "We bought and installed extras of these on our RV, just because the manufacturer never seems to put them in convenient places.  I want to pull into my site, and sit right in my seat at the leveling controls and do everything right there.  I installed extra level bubbles around the driver so all my rough leveling is done, and THEN I can walk around and fine-tune it at the back.My only warning to buyers:  make SURE you have them exactly where you want them before pressing on.  They DON'T move or come back off.  It's actually difficult to set them prefect on the first try because they stick so well.  Use a good carpenter's level to get the RV straight, then hold these steady with both hands and place CAREFULLY.  I'm kinda shaky so I really had to brace my hands on the RV while setting them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Makes level soooo easy. When I bought this I thought it seas just a simple bubble level. It is, but it is marked in inches of level error, so hat makes it super easy to level in one shot.  For example, it might show 3&#34; of &#34;unlevel&#34;, so you just use two 2x6 or 2 plastic leveling blocks and its right every time. We toured the entire US and stopped at more than 100 RV parks and campsites. I never one try to get the level right ( except when I put the blocks on the wrong side ! )"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've had a bottle of this in my garage for years, and it is great to put on threads to keep them from seizing.  I put it on basically every bolt that I might ever have to remove again.I only wish the package was better.  The brush is very messy.  I always end up using my finger, but a fine tipped squirt bottle would be perfect.Other than that, its a great product.  Also, unless you are a professional mechanic, 8 oz's will last a lifetime."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff has a million uses in the garage and around the house/yard.  Any fastener that may rust, corrode, or otherwise lock up, just put a thin coat on the threads and don't worry...it'll come right off next time.  Use it on axle bolts, lug nuts, spark plugs, really any nut, bolt, screw, or anything exposed to the elements that you don't wan to seize.  And for the price, an 8oz bottle will last you for years!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use Permatex regularly, especially on lug bolts. It is economical and this size container is especially handy to have. Remember to stir the contents well and use only a very small amount. I tend to use a disposable acid brush for application, rather than the lid mounted brush. In fact, I tend to remove the included brush and prefer to just have the lid as a lid.  It has never failed me. I would use a copper based product for exhaust work, but this works well for all other fasteners. It also cleans up easy."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "simple, logic and easy to use.  a useful tool to read data from the computer on your car, read codes and diagnose by yourself with a little search on the web. you can take note on the different indicators to know the \"normal parameters\" of your car, and notice when any change occurs and an error code lights your CEL, that way it will be easier to tell what went wrong.The only con is that there isnt any cable or software to connect to a PC or laptop- that would make it a better tool."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces. Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works. I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go. This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more. The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product. You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle. Don't wait like I did. Order this NOW!!! As usual Amazon came through with the shipping. If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me. Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I saw a review on Mojo channel where the reviewer used the MPG display to increase mileage.Based on this I bought one and I'm not disappointed.I can see this easily paying for itself in less than a year.The real time MPG display allows you to tame that lead foot and get awesome mileage on a long run.I did an 8 hour drive last week and must have got conservatively 5MPG better fuel economy. You do have to work at viewing the display and feeding it back to that right foot. Very easy to install - under 5 minutes.If you're not a gadget fan then don't buy it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I put this on almost everything that has an electrical connection. WAY&#8230; Way&#8230; Cheaper purchasing this tune then buying little packets every time a bulb needs to be replaced, or spark plugs.When I change plugs I put this on, fixed a poor radio connection putting this in the plug (Never flickers, or turns off now), putting some on bulbs insures an easy removal in the future. If you have had a stuck bulb you know what I'm talking about.Great stuff every one should have some laying around!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "in my 08 tahoe, i changed plug and wires recently, i used Tune up Grease both inside of the wire boots and on the porcelain section of the plugs.I installed a set of iridium plugs and a set of ferrite wires in my 08 tahoe, the wires came with a tiny packet of tune up grease but this never seems like enough to me (not that i apply a lot, keep it simple.)the &#34;average&#34; fuel economy on the dash instant read computed had been stalled at 13.9 MPG for a very long time, this is a composite of in town and highway driving. I changed the plugs and wires with the help of this tune up grease and reset the average MPG, within 10 days my average is up to 14.8.I did NOTHING to the vehicle other than install wires and the plugs.This grease helps ensure a good, insulated connection and is a must for a little job like this which can make a difference in your mileage.this is a big tube and will last you a lifetime."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This Permatex Dielectric grease works great to seal out dust & dirt. I used it on my mower spark plug boots as I have a few areas of the yard that kick up a good bit of dust when I drive over them and this applied correctly makes a great seal between the boot and the plug to keep the plug clean and thus a good high spark going to the engine. If you want to use it on smaller items, you may need an appropriate applicator as it only comes with the &#34;toothpaste&#34; style opening and that's not for finesse. I highly recommend this product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Use this goop on trailer line connections and when you replace a bulb in any application where moisture is likely.  My Tracker boat trailer has incandescent bulbs and they are encapsulated in nearly water-tight containers, but they do get water within.  They are not meant to be 100% tight so if you replace a bulb, be sure to add some of this stuff to the socket.  Also, the true thief of light is corrosion, not bulb extinction, so apply some wherever there is a vulnerable spot.When changing spark plugs, along with the application of anti seize on the plug threads, use some dielectric grease at the junction of the coil pack and valve cover gasket and at the wire to coil pack."}

So by the time I received it, the car was gone and I never used it.... if you want one for free, I've got it, just pay shipping. It is perfect match for the 2007 Buick silver.However that funny part was, the actual paint and applicator is great.  It is small, compact, easy to use, and the colors if matched from the factory name and number are used, it will be VERY close for any color you may select for any vehicle produced!

I am spoiled by the nice struts on my 96 XJ, so I bought a set of the Strongarm struts here on Amazon due to many positive reviews here and in Cherokeeforum.com. I put these on the Jeep in about 20 minutes and all it took was a small flat-head screwdriver and a 10mm socket. It was way easier than I expected! I used an adjustable backcountry ski pole to hold the hatch up while I did the work and it worked just fine. The hatch now goes up and stays up all by itself and works perfectly so I'm extremely satisfied with the fit and function as well as the sweet deal for a pair of new ones here on amazon."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I was rebuilding a wear ring on a sportjet engine and needed to cover a large area with jbweld, make it perfectly smooth and even. Took 3 passes to get a perfectly smooth surface and it's stronger than the original! The tubes are really big too, I didn't even use 1/2 yet and you can sand it and shape it. My advise would be to use it sparingly if you need to get exact dimensions because this stuff gets VERY hard, sanding it by hand is hopeless for anything other than fine grit sandpaper. Also, rough sand between applications because it turns smooth, almost glass-like when it dries so you have to sand between the layers to make sure it doesn't flake. I used a dremel ultrasonic sander with rough paper to get the dimensions right and then hand sanded for smoothness only"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Once a year seems pretty accurate. I'm sure it varies on where you live, how dirty your car gets, how often you wash it, how you wash it, what detergent you use, etc., etc. But it was highly rated by Consumer Reports so I figured I'd give it a shot. Goes on, wipes off easy - or about the same as other paste waxes I've used. Oh, and yes, this is a polish not a cleaner. If your paint is really dirty, faded, etc, then you need to use a cleaner first then a polish. Put it on thin, in the shade, keep it off plastic, use a microfiber cloth - in other words follow the directions and use it correctly and it works great. And, yes, if you have chips in your paint they will turn white - just like with any other polish."}

(names unmentioned) It dries to a flat finish and doesn't leave any greasy feel to it like (unmentioned again).Does not appear to build up like \"other\" products, but, I've only been using it for about 6 months but will definitely buy and use more when needed. It is great for navigation/audio/video screens too!!! I don't use it on leather as I have cleaners/moisturizers for that, but, otherwise I use this on all but the headliner.My interior is black all over and any spec of dust shows up and is very noticeable. This stuff cleans all of the dust and anything that may have stained w/out issue. Again, no film and no buildup. The non-greasy finish is the most appealing part of this product and the smell is an added plus."}

It's not a miracle worker. But when you want to get back to the detail look without major effort, this is the way to go. I keep the bottle and some clothes in my trunk on club rides.Compared to heavier interior cleaners, like Armorall, this stuff doesn't get oily residue on your windows. It doesn't wipe off glass completely clean but over spray comes off with just a little window cleaner."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I'm a skeptic when a product promises spectacular results with a minimum of effort, but this one delivers!  The light gray interior of my car looks brand new, and it took less than half an hour.  I have leather seats, too.  Finger marks, dust,  insect carcasses, spilled drink stains--all are history.  The only thing it didn't fully remove was a blue ink mark, but even that is lighter.My only regret is that the really lovely rose fragrance didn't linger, but oh, well."}

This cleaner, sprayed on to a microfiber towel, removed all of it very easily and the best part is that it left no residue on the vinyl. It is alcohol based so don't spray it all over the place inside the car, spray on towel then clean. I then applied a coat of Meguiars Protectant Natural Shine with a sponge and wiped excess and the color is now a low luster (no gloss) charcoal that is beautiful as it was intended."}

Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them."}

I purchased four of these Rhino 8000 and drove my 2 wheel drive Jeep Cherokee up on them with no problem whatsoever. My garage floor is smooth concrete and I had no problem with slippage. The only thing that I'll say is you cannot be timid when driving up onto these or any other ramp because you could cause wheel spin which would lead to a problem. My XJ has been sitting on these four ramps for two weeks while I do several underside upgrades and they are holding very well."}

Well surprise, she ran over another screw somehow last week and I pulled this bad boy out and plugged that hole right up without having to even put on the spare.People say you're supposed to have the holes professionally patched at a dealer, but if the hole isn't any kind of tear and is just a puncture, I have never had any issues with plugs falling out after 1000's of miles of driving."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This, my second kit, came from Amazon. I bought the first kit locally when I walked into my garage and saw a flat tire on the Honda CRV. I took the tire off the car, used a water bottle to find the air bubbles escaping the hole, followed the directions and repaired the flat. It took a little muscle to enlarge the hole and insert the plug. I cut off the excess plug and used a jump box  with an air compressor (that I periodically keep in the car)  to inflate the tire.Good thing the hole was in the tread. These kits won't work if the hole is in the sidewall.These kits pay for themselves with one use in time, money and frustration. Flats can cost $10 -15 to fix. I keep one in both cars.The jump box prevented tire damage because I didn't have to drive it to a gas station to be inflated."}

I added a full bottle to the transfer case (which was leaking the most) and a bit to the transmission sump; they are interconnected, but have separate fill and drain holes.  It was very difficult to get into the fill holes because of the viscosity of the stuff (about the consistency of molasses).  I drove around today, about 40 miles or so, and both the transfer case and the transmission still leak about the same as when I put it in.

I tried to turn the socket by hand which I have done many times and its easy to do, with this in the oil, forget it!

Easy to use, I would definitely use again in the future.  I didn't attempt to use the supplied brush, I bought some higher quality brushes instead after reading reviews of the brush falling apart.

{"label": 2, "raw": "Toyota does not make a locking gas cap for the Tacoma and the gas hatch door is not a locking type.  If you want to lock the gas tank this is one of few options to do so.  As you can see by it's picture, the cap is threaded to the bottom which is NOT the same as Toyota's OEM cap, which is smooth for about a half inch to make replacing the cap after filling the tank easier.I had to call Stant to make sure this would fit on my 2012 as the Amazon guide indicated it would not. I does fit but is not as slick as the original. Some online reviews and the Toyota manual warn about a \"check engine\" light if the gas tank is not properly sealed by the cap. That was not an issue with mine.I'd spend more money and buy one that fit better if it was available but from my research I couldn't find one."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After reading several reviews on this product I have to agree with most comments in regards to the locking fuel cap being poorly made. The Cap fits fine for the application. However the key mechanism is flimsy at best. The quality of the plastic components are not what I remember a Stant Locking Fuel cap to be. They def cheapened out on their manufacturing process`s.I gave the Stant Locking Fuel cap a 3 star rating only bc it does fit and is doing what the intended use is for. I do feel that if someone wants to remove the cap by force, they absolutely can. I primarily purchased this product based on Stant`s reputation in the Auto market, but this one leaves myself a bit disappointed. This is being used as a deterrent to help prevent vandals from pouring anything foreign into the tank. It does operate correctly when following the unlocking/locking procedures."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "Noticed immediate difference. Idle is smoother, acceleration is quicker, and cruising on the highway feels assertive with much more power to be had. There was a $10 off coupon for a long time and with prime so I could not refuse. I cannot wait to drive my car again. I feel like Mobil 1 is a brand that does not need to heavily advertise because their product is so good already. It is a trusted brand and your engine is being protected without any second guesses! BMW, Benz, and the GTR use this so why can't yours?!"}

Mobil 1 0w-40 is a great product, however their rebate process is way sub par.  I would definitely think twice before such mail-in-rebate deals come up again.  It is just not worth the time and effort for tracking this rebate.  Do yourself a favor, go to your local Wmart to get them for less.  MIR, what a joke."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This was the first oil change for my 2013 Elantra GT.  I had the i30 in Europe and this is the oil I used there.  The manual says 5W-30 or 20... but this has a wider range.I let the first 2500 miles to go on the original oil.  Just had the oil changed at the dealer and as always, this oil will never fails... you can feel the smooth engine sound and smoother engine grip.  I have a manual so revving the engine in gears i can clearly hear a difference.And by the way, this is the same oil that goes into my A4 for that past 5 years (5 oil changes).  just buy it and never look back."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I puchased this a while back, but I just now ran out of gas while out shopping.  Luckily the car parked next to me had a full tank of gas.  The gas cap wasn't locked so....Calm down, I'm kidding!  I used this for legal purposes and it worked great.  About 10 seconds of shaking and the gas was flowing.  After you get to the bottom of the tank, if you pull out the metal end without shaking or bumping it at all, you can maximize its effiency by not releasing any of the fuel in the siphon back into the tank you are draining.  This worked perfectly and I highly recommend this item."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This thing really does work excellent.  I used it to cycle out old gas in plastic cans into my car.  The new CARB compliant cans take forever to pour because they don't have a pressure hole.  I put the can on the trunk of the car, and put the siphon in each end.  A couple of shakes, and it started flowing until it was empty.  It took about 3 minutes for 5 gallons.What it didn't work for was trying to siphon gas out of my generator back into a gas can.  The gas tank was too shallow and there wasn't enough room to shake the siphon to get a good flow.  If you have a pump with deflate on it, you can still use this to get it started."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this to siphon fuel from my generator, and this tube is too large to even access the neck of the tank.  Also, this siphon is for containers that have lots of liquid, as you need to use up and down thrusting motion to start the priming process. So, a small generator wouldn't have enough liquid in it, and also not enough clearance to accept this siphon.  But, for large containers with lots of liquid this will absolutely work.UPDATE:  I was able to actually use this in my generator afterall.  I had to insert the hose at an angle to reach a certain part of the gas tank and it worked like a charm. But, you need to use the up/down motion really really fast to start it off and then it will siphon. I guess it takes a little practice and a little patience. Once you get it right you'll have no problem doing the next time. I keep this in my truck now in case I ever need it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I always buy a few hoses, two 10 footers and a 15 ft hose. I then connect together the best combination lenth hose that will get from water source to RV. Keeps my camp area neat, plus why on hot days would I want the sun heat the water in the hose and have to wait for the water to get cool by running it. Just makes more sense adding what ya need together then 30 ft of hose sprawel out on your camp site. Most campsites you will end up using the 15 footer anyway."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had to use quite a stack of wood blocks under my travel trailer (TT) jack because I've had the axles flipped on it.  It sits about 4 inches higher than when it was stock.  When I saw this recommended by Amazon I was all over it.  I still use a few blocks of wood along with this just to further minimize the amount of jack travel required.  I would have given it 5 stars if I didn't have to remove the foot from the jack in order to use it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Great way to keep your tongue jack from resting on wet ground or concrete, likely extending the life by not letting it rust out so quick.  Using with a tow package that includes a weight distribution assembly can prove problematic for smaller SUV's/cars though (tested with a 2008 Ford Escape with Class 3 hitch), as the tongue jack stand is so tall that you have to sometimes jack up your car up to clear it!  Still, I can't fault the jack stand for that.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "We only have stabilizing jacks on the back of the trailer so we do use the tongue jack as a stabilizer too.  My husband always carried a bucket of pieces of 2 x 4s to support the post.  We decided to try this reasonably priced jack stand instead.It is VERY heavy-duty and does a perfect job.  They sent us a red one, not the black as shown in the photo, but that doesn't effect my rating at all.  For the money, this is an excellent accessory."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If your RV has both the black tank and the gray tank valves emptying into one line then putting this valve in place doesn't work so well because if you try to empty just one tank they both will drain. For instance if your black tank valve is screwed up and you want to leave it open and just use the replacement valve instead of replacing the old one it will work but if you want to drain your gray tank without draining the black tank it won't work because both will drain at the same time. You won't be able to drain the gray tank without the back tank emptying to."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this for a small RV modification. My RV has a pretty clunky means of getting our freshwater hose into the water bay--essentially a removable floor pan that has a corner cut out for the hose.  So you remove the floor pan, route your hose, then replace the floor pan with the corner cut-out allowing the hose to pass through.  The trouble with that is that any bends or movement in the hose results in the floor pan lifting out of place.  I wanted something more secure to keep critters out of my water bay, so I'm using this.  I will mount it to a new floor and then screw that floor down permanently.  I have used these before for water hoses, and though it says &#34;electric cable hatch&#34; it will work fine for a standard RV freshwater hose too."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I read all the other companies material on how well their products worked on rust. I had planned on using the POR product but as with several other ones I was worried about how harsh and toxic they were. This product is  water based no harsh fumes and cleans up with water! So far I have used almost two bottles on a very rusty undercarriage. The product works fantastic, isn't scary to handle and the finished results are beautiful. You have to recoat in about twenty min. for the coverage to even out. In 24hours it dries to a hard satin black finish which you can top coat. This product  goes a long way for such a small bottle. A great buy!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Some hardware stores carry this in 8 oz. containers.  It is a buck or two cheaper to order it here and have it delivered.  It works better than naval jelly.  Not particularly recommended for show quality applications.I pour a little our on a 2&#34; paint brush to coat rusted ferrous metal.It stops rust and turns it black.Good for tools and equipment that have a tendency to rust.It is thicker that some of the phosphoric acid products and leaves a coating that can be painted over.I am using it on a rusty utility trailer and an old tractor.You don't have to paint it but you can.It kills the rust."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "used it on a surface on my BMW 328ic near the trunk area. I had 2 little spots approx. 1x2&#34; on the left and right that had rust forming UNDER the rubber gasket... I brushed of the rust with a dremel type tool and metal wheel brush to clear all rust and paint and used this on top. let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat. It does not seem to penetrate the little rust remaining as other products. I used &#34;Rost-Egal&#34; from Germany many many years I lived there and that has been the best product so far. You use it once and just know it works. With this very liquid product I am not so sure... It did not even seem to &#34;stick&#34; very well to vertical surfaces. For the next job I will look for a &#34;thicker&#34; product that will cling more to the treated area."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "these look GREAT when mounted, and have been mounted for 6 months with stuff occasionally bumping them without falling off the side of my truck. the glow in the dark nub is removable thankfully, as the orange color is enough to find them in the dark.

The first person on the scene tried several times to break the rear window with a crowbar, but was unsuccessful.

{"label": 2, "raw": "I have no doubt that this oil is good oil. I do however doubt that the 50-70% price increase above other high quality synthetic oils, is not worth it. I can purchase castrol edge with titanium, mobil 1 EP or Pennzoil Ultra from my local walmart for $26.00/5 qt. The cheapest you can find 5 qts of 5w30 RP is around $43.00, 65% more expensive. This might be worth it for a track car, but no way is it worth it in 99% of consumer cars."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I watched videos and read literature from so many oil manufacturers that I thought my head was going to explode. In the end, I settled on Royal Purple. I use it exclusively in my 2012 Nissan Frontier 4x4 (4.0 V6). There is certainly a lot of hype out there regarding this oil, and it may be just that....hype. However, I've done enough research to feel comfortable paying a little extra for this oil, and Amazon sells it for an unbeatable price (comapred to anywhere in Warner Robins, GA). My truck &#34;seems&#34; to love it (I'm not really sure what that means), and Bobby Likis swears by it. Two thumbs up from this guy!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It is a little too early to tell, but this oil really smoothed out my Honda CR-V when idling.  I am not sure if it was because it was really in need of an oil change (any oil), our the synthetic nature of Royal Purple; I dont drive the CR-V as much, so I cant tell. I also used it in my Odyssey (what I normally drive) and I the engine is super quiet and purring like a kitten.  I get that there is a lot of marketing and hype with products, but this really seemed to improve the cars' performance."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've always been told that Royal Purple products were good, but more expensive than the products I've used in the past. However, Amazon offered a package at a price that was actually cheaper than if I bought it at a local store, plus they shipped it for free. As for the product, since I tend to use quality synthetic oils in my 2008 Honda Civic I guess only time will tell, but I do seem to have more pickup that has a firmer feel. My Honda is slightly modified, but the other day I out ran a BMW that was attempting to cut me off as I merged onto the free way. Was it the oil? I don't know, but as long as I maintain my average of 35 MPG and can merge at that pace I will continue to buy Royal Purple. It should be noted that I also use ZMax at the same time, or when I can afford it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Recently I had a steel garage door installed. Opening and closing the door was a noisy event. I called the installer and was told that the hinges needed to go through a break-in stage and to reduce the noise a 20 weight oil was recommended. I applied a dab of Royal Purple Synthetic Engine Motor Oil 20W50 on each hinge and the results far exceeded my expectations. The door opening and closing was the quietest it has ever been including when the old door was still in use. This is an excellent lubricant."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Since they made this non flammable and tire sensor safe it doesn't seal as good as it used to, but still a good product.  Shake it up real good, pull out the nail or metal sticking in the tire first if there is one.  This won't seal a tire well if you leave the nail in there.  I carry two cans per car because I had a hose assembly break. Or,  keep the nozzle hose assembly off the top of the can for a spare.  This will seal some bead leaks, but not with the wheel mounted on the car.  Take the wheel off. lay it flat with the leaking bead side down, and slowly lift and lower the tire to get the stuff to the bead rim contact area.  Good for galvanized trailer tires which always seem to leak there."}

I ended up buying a regular weekly planner - 55% OFF! - The Planner - that is 8 1/2 x 11 and has all seven days on the right page and the left page has room to write a To Do List and Goals.  I found this to be more helpful because I could mark each day's eating and sleeping blocks, then also see them side by side - I could see her patterns more easily with a weekly view.  This planner was cute, just not what I wanted."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Baby Tracker brand books are the absolute best of the trackers that are available. You can track naps, feedings, diaper changes, activities, and notes. They're easy to use and have a nice clean layout.I started using the Newborn Baby Tracker, which tracks nights and days. It gave me a nice way to track feedings and note important milestones. Once I used up the entire book, I bought this Baby Tracker, which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now. Her caregiver notes her activities and sleeping times during the day. It's a great way for me to know what happened. Plus, it's nice to be able to look back and see patterns or trends."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've been using this since the day my baby was born (1 month ago) and it is a life saver!  It is a great way to track when I breastfeed, what breast he ate from, how long, etc.  Plus when pee diapers are changed and poopy diapers.  Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day...so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all.  I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate, slept, or pottied.  I plan on ordering 3 more so I have enough to track this entire first year of his life!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "THis has been helpful in tracking the feedings, diaper changes, naps and other developmental things for our little one but I REALLY wish they had laid it out so that you could leave it open and have the left side be AM and the right PM.  The way the pages are set up you have to flip a page to see a full day (starts with PM on the left and A.M. on the right).  It's a nitpick but if they had just let the user fill in AM or PM then the pages would be identical and you could look at a full day at a glance (with your hands full, holding a baby).  Sort of a pain to have to lean forward to pick it up and flip a page over just to see what happend prior."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old. I was having problems remembering how much she was eating, whether she was sleeping better or not. This helped me keep track of those things and more. I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she's older. I kept notes about her moods, what she did during the day. It even became a good tool to use with my nanny once I went back to work."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was a lifesaver especially during the first couple of months.  Being a new mom (and dad) we were exhausted and I can't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed, changed, etc. without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day.  It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need.  It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent (or whoever).  Once this ran out I bought another type of journal and am wishing I had just bought this one again."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I loved this tracker so much, I bought several more and used for the entire first year. It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Both of my boys (1 and 2.5) love stacking and building.  They also love cars.  So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them.  They both love these cars!  All of the cars have a little &quot;surprise&quot; (the ladder on the firetruck &quot;clicks&quot; as it raises up and down, the siren on the police car spins, etc.) &amp; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older.  They're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest, bigger, biggest."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab.  The bright colourful colours really held her attention.  When she was sitting we played the &quot;Mummy stack them, Baby knock them down&quot; game and &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; with the smaller colours under the bigger cars.  They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on (especially the small green one) when she was teething.  At 2, she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over.  She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game!  Great for learning big and small, colours and numbers.  Good value!"}

It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting. When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one!  He'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof. It will be a stacking toy later too! Great value for money..."}

It has a good number/variety of activities in it, especially as compared to other similar types of books.There are some activities for babies, but I think toddlers/pre-schoolers will get the most use out of it.  My daughter has a hard time getting the snaps on/off (they require a little extra &#34;elbow grease&#34; and/or for you to hold down the fabric on the page).  There are also some &#34;older&#34; activities, like the clock, or tying a shoe.Overall, good purchase."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The teether just arrived for my ten month old who seems to be cutting his second tooth.He's already figured out how to activate the vibration.  It is soft, yet has some ridges and bumps that he is pulling with his teeth and gums.  I think baby gives it 5 stars!!!There were contradictory reviews on whether the batteries were replaceable or not- the packing says they are NOT.  So unless whoever said they were replaceable is just handier than the rest of us, they do not appear to be replaceable."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this carrier before my son was born. I was a nanny and have tried many carriers with babies of various sizes. This is the most comfortable and versatile carrier I've tried yet.The downsides are that it is a little challenging to use. I have had to learn quite a few different ways to carry my son, who is just 3 months old. If you don't adjust the carries you use as your baby grows, it can be very uncomfortable for both you. It is also very bulky. It doesn't even fit in an empty diaper bag. My next carrier will be unpadded."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My son loves this.  He likes the &quot;kangaroo&quot; position best. He was actually crying the first time we put him in it this way, and stopped immediately.  DEFINITELY make sure the one you buy comes with the video, though.  At our Babies R Us many were just in plastic bags (returns?) without the book and video.  They are a must.  The usual type carriers which have baby putting all their weight on their pelvic bone aren't good for their developing bones.  Slings keep the baby in more natural positions."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this as a spare for my original Co-Sleeper. There really aren't a ton of places you can buy these, so I wasn't too concerned about the price. All told, Baby Bungalow did offer it for the best price, including shipping.While the sheet is a perfect fit, I was perplexed by the 'button' holes on the under side of each corner. Can't imagine what those are for. That or my Co-Sleeper is on the older side and there have been design changes since.Overall, quality product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased a total of 4 of these, thinking I needed to change the bedding constantly due to spit up.The instructions said to hang dry only so I thought I needed more to get through the week.  It turns out I can just toss it in the dryer and put it right back on the mattress.Had I known I didn't need to hang dry, I wouldn't have purchased any extra and just went with the 2 they gave me when I purchased the cosleeper.The material is average, nothing special.  It holds up well to lots of washes and uses."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The shipping was quick. The colors are pretty but the sheets themselves are not soft. That was disappointing to my daughter who I bought the sheets for and of course to me. They are not inexpensive so I expected more. I purchased five sheets to go with the co-sleeper I bought her for their first baby. We have not assembled the co-sleeper yet but when I received it the box was all torn and dented. Looking at it the contents looks okay, but we will see when the my son in law puts it together."}

My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great. It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all. I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors. So far this has been a great product. The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much. Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly! But so far so good!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this product...  My sister in law has a baby 4 months older than my daughter, and she has a diaper genie.  She is stuck having to buy the special cartridges.  So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.  Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper. With the Diaper Genie, you have to twist the darn thing and it's hard to operate.  My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house... she ends up cutting the bags.  When she's at my house, she can't go wrong, just flip the handle! The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner!!!!"}

There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well \"hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers\". Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so \"diaper genieized\" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable. I highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have no doubt that my wife and I will be happy with the Diaper Champ (our first baby is due in two weeks).  But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works.  The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a  piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down).  The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily.  It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn.  This is not one handed operation as the box states.  After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.  And you do not even need to ask.  Yes, it was made in China."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it's been great so far.  (We'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It's so easy to use and you don't have to buy the special bags.  We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have used this for 11 months and I love it. What we did was after the baby started having odor in his #2s we bought some of those diaper bags from dollar tree (100 for $1) and put the dirty diapers in those little bags. So easy! Never an odor problem. And I use regular kitchen garbage bags in it, so no special bags to buy.I did research when I was registering before the baby and looked at all of the other diaper pails and this one was the one that came out ahead. I am glad I researched it because I am very happy with it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this product.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I use cloth diapers and diaper covers, and it doesn't have a whole lot of room for this type of diapers.  It lasts me about 2 days.... 3 if I really stretch it.It has no odor, other than when you open it, but that is inevitable.Infact, the Babies R Us in my area uses this product in their &quot;mother's room&quot;.  That seems to say alot!And the best part is that its cheapest over the long run... no special bags to buy... what a pain that seems to me.  I use plain old garbage bags... or even very large shopping bags.Great product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "What I liked:  Contained the smell.  Ease of use.  Takes regular garbage bags (saves money!).  Great capacity (empty it out once in 7 days or so). Sturdy. Easy to clean - I wipe it down with Clorox wipes.What I didn't like: Not especially good-looking and at times the lid gets stuck in a certain position (could just be a problem with mine) hence the four stars.Would buy again though and do recommend it. (I have used the Diaper Genie at a friend's place - didn't like it)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "After reading all the reviews on-line for this product I chose to register for it, now that I am using it I am disappointed.  I'm not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero's or my daughter has super smelly diapers.  Either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the \"Champ\" is in the back corner of the room.  I guess I'm just grateful that the whole house doesn't smell as bad as her room."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag. The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are. I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is another great baby purchase.  When I brought it home, my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a \"gadgety\" baby thing that we didn't need.  He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked!First, it really keeps the odor in.  I'm pretty sensitive to smells, but this one does a good job of containing odors.  Just to play it safe though, I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so (you could probaby go longer), and I spray it with Lysol as well.  Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.  Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain---I definitely recommend this product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "You can't put poopie diapers in this pail, it doesn't hold the smell back at all.  I use it for the wet diapers and it's fine.  I use the scented bags for the poopie diapers and throw them away in my regular garabage that gets taken out every day.  Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.  The big blue round part on the side broke off for some reason and it wouldn't go back on.  I ended up using masking tape to hold it on.  It serves it's purpose, but I'm not thrilled with it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it's sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This one is the best and a must have! Don't waste your time or money on the other ones.  The Diaper Genie is way too complicated.  It's a trash can so it should be simple.  I shouldn't have to read directions on how to use it!  This one is great because it is so easy to use, I never smell any odor, and it uses normal trash bags!  Why spend money on special trash bags?  I like the cheap roll of scented trash bags for like $2.00.  They work great and they are small so you can keep them in the nursery for quick and easy trash changes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We like it that this diaper pail uses regular garbage bags instead of specialty diaper pail inserts/liners.  The mechanism works well to dispose of the diapers and attempt to keep the smell isolated, but at a certain level of the room (usually nose-height when you're sitting on the floor) you can still smell poo.  It works well to bundle the diapers into compact little bundles and use the velcro to seal the bundles before you put it in the diaper hole.  Overall, we are very satisfied."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Works well as diaper pail, but it's awesome as a bathroom garbage can.  No mess, no smell. Very easy to replace garbage bags, you do not have to touch anything.Got it as a gift, and was very skeptical about it at first. (It's only 100ft to the garbage  shoot outside the apartment).  That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up.  Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.  At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!  It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.  I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.  The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!  I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.  It was such a pain to use.  We all hated it.  The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.  And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.  It takes regular trash bags.  I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.  And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!  If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We just couldn't bring ourselves to buy a pail that required us to purchase extra refills.  This pail is great.  I do put really dirty diapers into a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail, to reduce the chance of nasty seepage and rub-off onto the chamber as the diaper is moved into the bottom.  It is not difficult to open, and the fact that it has a good clasp offers a sense of security for when our little girl starts pulling herself up on things, which will be soon (she's 8 months old).  We change the bag a couple of times a week, and the nursery smells fine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We also wanted the diaper champ instead of the Genie because...who wants to buy special bags??  It is a life saver to just throw in a kitchen garbage bag.  We ended up receiving ours as a hand-me-down, and I was worried that it would smell.  Surprisingly enough - it only starts to smell when it's time to change the bag. And sure enough, the lid would start \"sticking\" right about that time, which told me that the bag was full and it was time to change it (instead of struggling to stuff another couple diapers in).  Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.  Just keep some Lysol wipes by the changing table, and wipe it down if you get anything anywhere. Piece of cake."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper.  (Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have purchased this diaper pail four years ago [I was so disgusted with Diaper Genie we had at the time (not just wasting the money on the refills, but also the smell and having to push & twist was more than I wanted to deal with)].Diaper Champ was so much easier to operate! When my daughter turned one, she started disposing of her diapers herself and she never failed!We used regular grocery bags and changed them twice a week to avoid them getting too full and/or smelly. [We've discovered that regular shopping bags from Target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we're now using them with daughter #2, replacing them once a week]. We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001! It's virtually indestructible, easy to wash and operate, doesn't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it, and it DOES NOT SMELL!I would highly recommend this product to anyone."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We purchased the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie because we didn't want to buy special bags.  We have now used it for a year and it has been great!  We can use our regular garbage bags so the cost is very minimal and we don't have to worry about going out and buying those special bags like for the Diaper Genie.We use cloth diapers and it works really well for that.  We change the bag almost daily, as we have two in diapers and cloth diapers are bulkier.  When it gets hard to turn, it is time to change the bag!The Diaper champ really minimizes the odor and is very easy to clean up, we just wipe it with a soapy cloth and sometimes spray a little disinfectant to help with the smell.This is great and I would recommend it for everyone."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this! I was hesitant to buy too since the \"sheet\" is expensive and hardly a \"sheet\" at all. But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof. If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet. You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats. We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it. This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib...bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn't fit the crib very well. It is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though. It just has problems fitting around the big 4 corner crib rails so I am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat.Today I just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this. My son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off! AH!  So I improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail, it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on.  It would have cost about the same price to buy an actual[...] rail cover so it works out.  He usually only teethes on 1 side too!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this based on good reviews in the Baby Bargains book, so I had high expectations. It does make it somewhat easier to change sheets in the middle of the night, but you still have to unsnap it from about 10 places on the crib to do so; I've also found the snaps a little difficult to engage. If you're not using crib bumpers, the look of all the elastic pieces on the crib slats isn't too attractive. I'm glad to have one of these, but it isn't the miracle sheet I hoped for."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It's kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet (and never having to change the crib sheet), but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight.  Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this, it got a bit easier.  It's not super fast to unsnap and snap on, but better than replacing the crib sheet (esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out).I have 3 of these so I don't have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough.  Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric, unfortunately."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been using these sheets for 6 months.  I have two Ultimate Crib Sheets, and when my 6 month old has diaper leaks or blowouts while sleeping, I can easily switch to the new ultimate sheet.  They are machine washable and dryer safe, which I LOVE, considering I am doing baby laundry multiple times a week.  Putting regular sheets on crib mattresses is a huge hassle, so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is a huge help for middle of the night diaper leaks.  It takes me much less time to switch these out than to change the whole sheet.  I leave baby's cute sheets on the mattress and use this on top.Size: Both of mine shrank a tiny bit in the dryer, but it is not a problem at all.  They fit flat on top of a regular crib-size mattress.Material:  The top side is a breathable, soft cotton layer.  The bottom side has a soft, waterproof plastic feel."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth. Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort: it's made of  lightweight foam. As a result, changing her sheets is also super easy. I just have to lift the mattress, and it takes two seconds. On the other hand, snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus, the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash, which means snap on crib, unsnap, snap again before wash, unsnap, snap on crib...) So, if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room, I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners. If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room, then by all means, try the ultimate crib sheet..."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The baby isn't here yet.  But we've bought a couple of these.  I'm a tad hesitant because they don't fit very well on our convertable crib.  They do give instuctions, saying to just use a slate next to the thickers corner one(for convertable cribs), but I find it fits very awkwardly.  However taking the whole crib apart(with the bumper being a huge deal, also to get on, considering the thick corner posts), it makes me want to cry to think I'd have to do this very often.  So, we'll give these a shot.  I may end up doing the zip on sheet set, which would work with any crib, and seems like a dream.  I've also heard great things about those.  I just didn't want to invest in that, if I could get away with these.  Will let you all know, if these turn out to be a disaster."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I thoroughly enjoy this product. It covers the full top surface of the crib, give or take an inch. My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months. The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture. I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet, another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet (since the playpen pad can't be easily washed), and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently. I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it. The snaps work well on small crib rails. They may not fit around larger crib posts. I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib. At 3am, I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "UPDATE: After washing them only a few times, the snaps have been falling off so this sheet is not very sturdy. I now call it a \"disposable sheet\" and would rate it only 3 stars if I was allowed to change the rating.My previous review:This sheet is a fantastic idea. Imagine waking up to feed your baby only to have them spit up and/or poop/pee on the bed sheet. Instead of taken apart the bumper to remove the mattress to change the sheet, all that is required is to unsnap the corners that secure sheet in place. Then you put another one on...the whole process will take you less than 5 minutes. I have three, one for the hamper, one on the crib, and one waiting to be used in case of a bed wetting!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this sheet!  I have 4 of them (2 for each child). It is super absorbent and stays in place! They are great for potty training accidents and for one unfortunate night with the stomach flu.  I used to wrestle with matress when changing the sheets but not anymore.  I have the pretty sheet that matches the bedding on the bottom and the crib sheet on top.  Now if there is a middle-of-the-night accident I just unsnap the cirb sheet, pull it off, and put a clean one in its place.  This is one a the gifts that I give at all baby showers because I think no Mom should be without at least 2 of these (you need a spare!)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is such a helpful product that helps keep the baby's sheets protected. I love how it has saved me from changing the entire crib sheets off of the mattress. It's saved me money since it protected the crib sheet so well that I haven't bought any new crib sheet. I'm still using the ones that I received during my baby shower. The elastic snaps definitely serve a purpose for safety so I use them but they are a little tiresome. If there were a better, yet safe, alternative for the snaps I would have given this product 5 stars. Overall, I'd highly recommend this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The first time I went to change the crib sheet on my baby's crib I understood the importance of the Ultimate Crib Sheet!  It was given as a gift & I put one more on my registry after realizing I had to take the whole crib ensemble apart to change the sheet!  Now I change the sheet only occasionally & it is more for asthetics.  The Ultimate Cribe sheet snaps off & I put a clean one on - so easy & practical!  Save money on sheets & just get one or two decorative sheets & get at least 2 of these!!!Update at 7 mos (July04): I have survived VERY WELL with 2 of the Ultimate Crib Sheets - and boy when they start slithering around the crib & wetting through diapers & spitting up solids - you will be SO thankful to have this little dandy item!  Don't go without!!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I absolutely love the idea of this crib sheet. After receiving one as a gift I immediately tried putting it in the crib. To my disappointment, the elastics at the corners will not fit around the wide posts of my crib. For those of you that have Italian made cribs (I have a Baby Italia), this sheet may not work for you either. This should come as no suprise since it is also harder to find crib bumpers that fit correctly too. Needless to say, if you have an Italian made crib, keep the packaging and the receipt. You may find that you'll have to try another brand."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought three of these before my son was born and it was money well spent - we bought one cute sheet that goes with his bedding that we leave on and change the ultimate crib sheet as needed. Believe me, when your little one spits up in the middle of the night and you need to change the sheet, you will be so thankfull you just have to unsnap and put a fresh one on. Changing crib sheets with a bumber in place is a major pain! These are super soft, hold up to repeated washing, stay in place and absorb the mess away from your baby. Return all those cute sheets you bought and invest in a bunch of these - you won't regret it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Reality is...you don't have to have this, but it really helps simplify your life if you do.  You don't have to take off the crib bumper and lift the mattress to take off this crib sheet.  Instead, you just unsnap and place a clean one on top of the mattress.  I have a regular crib sheet under the Ultimate Crib Sheet for decorative purposes and in case he needs to be placed on it if my spare is dirty.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's annoying to have to snap all of the straps prior to washing it and also because there is some shrinking that occurs after it's washed (Make sure you put it on the low setting in your dryer).  Also, they are expensive.  I have two of them and it's worked out just fine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great product!  Buy two and put them both in the crib.  When your little one leaks in the night, just unsnap and toss the dirty one aside, and you'll have a clean one underneath.  As far as the snaps falling off, my son had pyloric stenosis (severe vomiting requiring surgery) and I washed these 3 or 4 times a day for weeks.  Never once did I have any of the permanent snaps fall (there are two completely detachable snaps on the ends that I don't even use).  I even washed and dried on the normal cycle (not gentle) in warm water (not cold, as is recommended)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this, put it on the crib, took one look at it, took it off, and returned it.  I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it--it bunched and wouldn't lay flat.  Also the snaps didn't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure.  This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment.  My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I don't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I played the game of frustration everytime I had to change a crib sheet......which became much more often after more blow outs and spitting up began!  I knew I wanted to keep the bumper and searched the internet to find a solution.  This was the first recommendation to pop up with rave reviews!  I tried one out and absolutely loved it! Changing sheets is a breeze!  They stay one very well too.  I liked it so much I ordered another to have as back up.  Highly recommended if you are done lifting that dang mattress up!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet is a very useful product.  It protects the sheet, eliminating the need to change the crib sheet if there is diaper leakage or spitting up.  It goes on and off in seconds - so helpful to a Mom, especially in the middle of the night. It is large enough to cover the whole crib surface.  It seems to be waterproof and yet doesn't make the baby sweaty.My only concern would be that since it attaches to the crib rails, there is an outside chance a baby could loosen/undo a strap.I think it would be handy to have two of these to rotate them out.  I like it and would recommend it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer.  We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner.  The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners.  No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side.  So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn't appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue.  If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn't seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions.  We'll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags. That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail. The springs have been popping off since about the first month. My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke, which completely gets rid of the supposed &quot;odor-free&quot; feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either).  Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Initially my husband and I decided not to purchase a diaper pail because we wondered what was the point, diapers stink and no matter how much money one spends on a diaper pail it's going to emit odors and smell bad. Then, when we were changing diapers ten times a day we decided it would probably be easier to have one, especially for the middle of the night diaper changes. Several of my friends disapproved of the Diaper Genie and recommended we purchase an inexpensive diaper pail that uses regular garbage bags. We took that advice and selected the Safety 1st diaper pail and we are pleased with the product. Odor-Less - No. We empty it as needed, usually once a week, and realize it's a diaper pail - just as our garbage pail in the Kitchen needs to be emptied daily someday so will the diaper pail. I place an aroma jell in the little basket which helps with the odor."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really like this diaper pail.  It helps with odor control, but is certainly not odorless.  As if anything can disguise the odor of a poopy diaper.  I think that a diaper pail is a must in the nursery.  There are just too many diapers to not have one and an open garbage can or even a regular one is just too stinky.  This one has a lid that closes nicely to shut out odors.  It has a nice little compartment for odor disks to help manage odor.  It can be a bit of a hassle to empty and reload, but it only needs changing about every two days and since it fits regular kitchen bags, it is worth the money.  It isn't very expensive to begin with."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are designed to cover plugs you leave plugged in, such as lamps or alarm clocks, so keep kids from pulling on the plugs/cords and damaging them or injuring themselves.  And that's exactly what they do.  We use several in our home and have had no problems.  They're also very easy to install with a simple screwdriver.Many of the negative reviews here complain either it is too hard to open (which is completely the point) or that it only holds \"small\" (aka standard) plugs, which should be obvious from the description and picture, so they're not really being fair."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I tried to use this power strip cover for about 2 months when our twin daughters were 8-10 months old. It was frustrating for my husband & I -- hard to get the power strip inside, hard to keep things plugged in, and too big to hide out of the babies view (not to mention that it's bulky and a bit ugly). For the babies, it became yet another interesting thing around the house that we had to wrestle from their hands. They were able to unplug the cords easily and were starting to reach their fingers into the top hole when I finally gave up on using it. Yes, the cover did keep the babies from actually touching the outlets in the power strip, but I could have accomplished the same thing with a couple of normal outlet covers.In the end, I rearranged our cords making the power strip & this cover unnecessary. It was just too annoying to keep using the cover."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Really? How could this possibly be useful? I saw somebody else post that the baby's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating. Really, I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier. The baby's whole hand fits through the giant gap. Plus the thing is huge. Like almost as big as a shoe box. And really ugly. I don't know what we'll replace it with since the others don't sound better, but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show. There's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room, so I might as well just leave the cords as is."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It's funny how many people have positively reviewed this. Yes, it's very convenient, easy to use, and fits well. What it doesn't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs! It's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening. In fact, I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover. If I can fit my hand in there, so can a child. And it doesn't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there. This product is, in a word, worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets, or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip. But please don't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought and returned the other popular brand of power strip cover because it doesn't fit iPhone/iMac chargers.  This one does.  And it adjusts lengthwise so you can make it pretty long if you need it to.  Some other reviews mention the size of the opening on the top - it's true, it's surprisingly wide, I can usually reach in enough to pull out a plug when I need to, rather than opening the whole thing.  So could your kid conceivably pull one of your plugs out when you don't want him/her to?  Sure, but the cover is also tall enough that it would be pretty darn hard for them to stick their fingers down into the open sockets.  Bottom line: treat this as a deterrent and not a substitute for knowing when your kid's playing with power cords."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "There is no perfect solution to window blind cords, but I think these do well. I actually used this kind years ago for pets. I do usually have to open and close them to unwind, but that is okay. What is important is that they put the cord high above a child's reach. I just ordered many more for the rest of the windows. However, for the kid's room we have the kind that is screwed into to the wall and wraps the cord around, so there is no chance of these plastic parts falling."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have busy almost-two year old twins who are fascinated with the many window blinds in our house. I didn't want to spend a fortune, but needed a quick fix. These did the trick, easy to install, and keep the cords just out of their reach. They do pop off from time to time, but are easily replaced. I've purchased several different brands, and they are all about the same. I wouldn't spend extra money on ones that claim to do better than this type."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Although the design of these is to wind the cord shorter, when a window is open and blinds are drawn the cord does get longer. I left a room for 30 seconds and came back to see that my son had pulled the cord down and had it wrapped around his neck. Terrifying. Although these do pop open easily, they most definitely did not pop open from the pressure of a child's neck which I find to be a SERIOUS design flaw. From a company named Safety 1st - back to the drawing board on these!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It's pretty hard to find a great oven lock.  This one had terrible reviews, but was the kind we needed for our new oven (a side lock).  We've been using it for 9 months, and my toddler (who is now almost 2) seems quite safe.  She's pulled on the handle of the oven a few times (and we've told her \"no\", which she seems to accept most of the time) and the lock has stayed put.  She's tried to operate the lock a few times, and has not been successful at that either.  I can see a toddler who is very interested in the lock being able to figure it out, but she has been easily diverted from it.It's held up great, and I don't find it too cumbersome to lock/unlock it whenever I use the oven (which is pretty often - I cook a lot). I have no complaints."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These locks just cannot be beat.  They were featured on HGTV to baby-proof your house which is how I found out about them in the first place.  They cannot be opened at ALL by the child, unlike many of the other items out there.  You have to not only have the key to open the door, you have to know how to manipulate it to open.  If you have chemicals that you have store within a child's reach, there is no other better way than this lock to make SURE that child is safe.  I feel very blessed that I found out these locks exist because my little one is extremely curious and figures out EVERYTHING! Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  Regarding the installation, my husband is not a handyman - he's a musician and if he can figure it out, so can just about anyone else.  Buy them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This product is a great concept, BUT it has a critical flaw for me.  The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter.  I mean, why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers?  Hello?  Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed.  What about those holes?  It is cute that the manual says \"do not drill through the door,\" hugh?  Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors?  Also, what happens if say the door cracks while I drill?  Who pays for that?  I know the answer to that one -> ME!  Soooo....product is going back.  Non-starter"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I received a different nail clipper as a baby shower gift. It had a plastic cover over the top of the cutting end of the clipper, similar to this one, but with a plain white handle instead of the cute bumble bee:Sassy: Bumble Bee Nail Clippers. It was terrible. I couldn't see my baby's finger nails at all and it wasn't sharp enough.Then I used this Safety 1st Nail Clipper at my mother's house. It was so much easier to use than the other one. The size is perfect for her little fingers. I could easily see my baby's nails and clip them without fear of cutting her. The handle fits nicely in my hand. And the blade is sharp enough to cut the nail off in one clip. I bought one for myself and it's the only one I'll use now."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We had the Summer Infant clippers first.  They came in a two-pack, with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper.  Neither one worked well.  The larger of the two didn't work at all.  These Safety First clippers cut every time.  For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby's nails, you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut.  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!These work every time."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is baby nail clipper #4 that we've tried, and our search is finally over.  It's sharp enough to cut nails on the first try and the white bulb is pretty comfortable to hold.  What more do you need in a pair of baby nail clippers?The losers:- Safety 1st model 49539 (has the holder for emery boards) - the grip is comfortable but the clippers are blunt and therefore useless.  The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper (the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring) - has the safety guard so you don't catch the baby's skin in the clippers, but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail.  Plus, it's not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness, but something about the way it's designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby's nails.Search ends here, thank goodness!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago.  I tried to trim my 3 month old son's nails, granted he is the fidgeting type.  Just as I was about to clip one of his nails, he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger.  His finger bled, my son cried and I panicked.  Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage.  But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company.  They are VERY safe.  I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents.  I shudder to think of using nail clippers again, especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My baby is two years old now and he loves his pacifiers. I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things... this was one of them. No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his (her) pacifier that he (she) loves and always uses. Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately, its too heavy. Especially if the baby is not feeling well. Don't buy this. Get a real thermometer."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am sorry I bought this tub.  It is very uncomfortable for my daughter.  Used it since she was about 3 weeks old.  I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it's uncomfortable.  Also, there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain!  It's way too small.  She's now 4.5 mos and I'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it.  And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug -  it's an enormous effort to plug it each time.I've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger, nicer, more comfortable, and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this tub before my son was born, thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink.  I do like that I can use it in the sink, but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds!  It doesn't hold much water, either.  I wish I had read reviews before I bought it, because now, after only 2 months, I'm just going to replace it and throw it away.  What a waste!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this tub after borrowing from a friend because our Four Stage Bath System was so bad it was cutting up my baby's legs.  This was okay - soft all over, no problems like we had with the four stage, however because it folds the hinges tend to leak.  Also, you can't fill it to the level you would want because of the way its reclined.  The back is still very slippery despite the nonslip matt.  We only used for a few weeks before just bringing her in the tub with Mom and washing her that way."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year.  Living in an apartment, this tub is great for small spaces.  I use it in the big tub and when I am done, I just rinse it and leave it to dry.  When dried, I fold it and put it in the cabinet.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping.  But considering it folds for storage, that was not a big issue.  It's a great tub otherwise."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this tub without doing any research on it. I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby. Well, I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning. Also, I have yet to get it to shrink, so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time. The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller, but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick. However, that causes him to slide down the sling and it's quite hard where the sling ends, so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back. Also, it just doesn't seem to hold water. I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out. All in all, I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks, I am getting another one."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had ordered a different tub for my shower but never received it.  I had my baby so I picked up this tub last week.  However I could not figure out how to use the sling alone for my 1 week old infant.  It appears that you have to hold her head up while in the sling which leaves you with only 1 hand to bathe her with.  But anyone with an infant knows that they kick and squirm and I found it very hard to use.  I tried to snap it into the tub for the 2nd stage (thinking better support) and I could not get it to fit!Much easier to sponge bathe a new baby on a contoured changing pad.  I'm thinking of returning and going for the EuroTub."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I haven't had problems with this tub.... I used another tub for my son for the first 3 months, and that tub became too small, so I purchased this one.  I'm so glad I did.At 3 months, my son was large for his age, but unable to sit up yet, so this tub was perfect.I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with the other comments that it is not easily collapsible to store, and it is bulky, but we simply let it dry in the bathroom overnight and store it under his crib during the day - so space turned out to not be so much of a problem.I have had no issues with the tub leaking though.  Once it is completely extended, there is a good seal and it does not leak.I have and will continue to recommend this tub to all my friends.It's accomodating for longer than any tub out there.well worth the money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We love this tub.  We have been using it since our daughter's first bath.  It was tough to pop the tub into the expanded version, but that tight fit means it won't leak.  If you don't pop it together right it will leak.  We leave it set up in the tub when not in use so it's not really taking up any vital space.  Our daughter seems to like the sling.  She's four months old now and didn't cry even during her first bath.3/06 - We're now using this tub on child #2.  Still no problems.  This child likes it too.  Between the two girls we've been using this tub for 22 mo.  It has never leaked, not once."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open! I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want! Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child. And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly. Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day....got another brand...."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use.  My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue.  It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good, either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it.  I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead.  I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born.  It is very easy to put over my sink.  The green net comes with the tub is easy to use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Unfortunately, I am not able to find this bathtub anywhere (( My son used to have it 6-7 years ago). It is great! It is the only one bathtub where a baby does not slip forward and doesn't go under water. This blue gear is awesome. I do not understand why it is discontinued. I do not care if it is leaking. I did not notice that because it was used in adult bathtub. IF SOMEBODY HAS IT, PLEASE, I WILL BUY FROM YOU."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for this bath tub and recieved it as a shower gift. Everything on the tub works well. My son does slide down the sling and I do have to put him back. But I don't think it's possible for that not to happen because he's so actively moving the whole time. I've never had a problem with it leaking. The suction cups do get stuck on very hard and I really have to pull to get it up so much that I pulled one suction cup off last time(It went back on very easily). But theres a reason they stick so much to keep my son safe. So I am glad to have this tub and would recommend it over all the others."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks. This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week. I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water. So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks. Really, who wants a tub that leaks???? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub....so we are in an awkward transition phase. a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with. I wouldn't buy this tub."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It leaks every time I use it. It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.  I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.  I love the sling, but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.  If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside, it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.  I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using, I should have.  I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.  Buy at your own risk."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower.  I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub.  Wrong!!  First of all, the tub leaks.  You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide.  My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy.  The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i was surprised to read all those negative reviews regarding this tub.  i had two different tubs before, and i got this one when my daughter was 5 months old, she's now one year old and still uses it.  granted, i never tried to fold it since those few inches don't seem to make much of a difference storagewise, so i don't know if its difficult to do.  i've had absolutetly no leaks with this tub, and the suction cups still work great.  the bathring works great, and can be moved out of the way when baby is old enough to sit alone.  although i still use the bathring so my daughter cant stand up all the time.  it's been 7  months with this tub, and nothing ever broke, or got worn.  i think this tub is great!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used. It is impossible to get folded and unfolded. When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling. My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water. She is now to big for the sling, but to small to sit up in the ring. I gave it a fair try, but I had to go out and buy another bath. It seems like a great concept, but it is really just a waste of [money]."}

{"label": 3, "raw": "We bought 2 of these, and used them to block off the computer desk from the rest of the family room, and to block off the 7' wide archway between the kitchen and the rest of the house. We soon found that while these are very sturdy and adaptable, they are tall enough that they are a hassle to step over. At least once a week, my husband or I will catch a toe or scrape a shin stepping over. So if you intend to use this fence as a corral, either indoors or out, this is a Great Buy. If you are planning to use it as a fence to block off a wide opening, pay the extra money for the metal version with the gate. you (and your toes) will be much happier."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is one of only a few products my husband and I would buy again with no hesitation.  We bought it over a year ago (with the extension) and have used it every day since.  When my daughter outgrew the octoganal arrangement, we just opened it up and have used it to block her from the kitchen and other dangerous areas.  She is not a climber yet, so I do NOT recommend using it in this fashion if your child is.  It will tip over, the circular formation is the sturdiest.  We haven't had any problems with pieces breaking off or the plastic being brittle and we adjust it almost daily.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. This is our experience. Your mileage may vary.Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! (&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. So far it's not too much of a problem. The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. The major downside is the price. Ack."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this from a friend whose son had outgrown it. It has been wonderful. We use it both indoors and out. Outdoors it's good for keeping and busy infant or toddler in one place so you can do yard work or relax without having to chase them around. It is especially handy in the backyard since we have a pool. I just put a few toys inside it with my son and he's happy for a while. We don't have a playpen so we use this inside as well when we need to make sure he stays out of harms way for a few minutes. We even use it for the dog when she sleeps inside at night because otherwise she chews on everything in the house while we're sleeping. It folds easily and stores great under the bed."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got our twin boys this Mozart Magic Cube for Christmas, when they were 6 months old.  We liked everything about it...except that it was TOO LOUD!  I've actually been amazed at the number of baby toys that are annoyingly loud.  Some to the point that they made our babies cry (like this one).  I've actually had to place duct tape over speaker holes on numerous things such as mobiles, play gyms, and an activity table because otherwise those products are great, just loud.  But therein lies the problem with this toy - there is no obvious speaker hole on it.  It's as if the annoyingly loud music emanates from every crevice.  Which is why it has been put away since Christmas.  Now that the boys are 9.5 months I may try to bring it out again and see if they will tolerate it.  If not I'll just sell this overpriced piece of plastic at my MOMs Resale next month."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn't seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this for my 4-month old son. He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it. The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra. The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby's musical skills.Cons: The battery didn't last long. We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new \"upgraded\" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The \"music\" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I know it says that this is for older babies but my daughter loves looking at the blinking lights and listening to the music. A piece of advice: it took me a little while to figure out that you had to press the orchestra button a few times to change the song. Before I figured this out, the same song was driving me crazy! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have a volume control button. It is quite loud and I sometimes wish I can make it lower."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This toy inspires me. I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound. Now he gets the full functionality of the toy. It lasts for years, offering various entertainments to various ages of kids. Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones, so we love this. Warning, it's very heavy. Don't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma's (we learned this lesson). The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety. We're never giving away this adorable musical toy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My husband, son and I all LOVE this toy. My niece had it before, so I knew it was a must-have with my little guy already. I love that he (1 year old) can be exposed to fun classical music with a toy that engages him. He loves that it all lights up (when the buttons on any side are pressed) and he has fun pressing the buttons on the different sides and seeing and hearing the difference it makes (pressing one side engages or unengages the instrument during the song).  An added BIG PLUS for parents - it does have an \"off\" switch. :)  SO key, even for those of us who appreciate the value and fun of noisy kiddo toys... there is still a time/place for quiet.Great, fun toy. :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend's daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, \"GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!\"Love it!"}

My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Fine toy, nice sound.  Much better than most other musical toys.  But I can't give it to my son yet as I can't seem to get these damned wires from the packaging out of the toy.  They are threaded through these tiny holes in the product and I haven't yet gone out to get pliers as someone else suggested.  You shouldn't need pliers to free a toy from its packaging.  Obviously the manufacturer didn't receive the memo that we are pushing for frustration free packaging. I even took out the screws that access the battery pack (which I am quite impressed with as well), hoping to access where the wires are stuck.  No luck.  If they just used regular string, it would easily come out, but these plastic coated wires are too stiff to pull through in the manner that they have put them."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.  I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think a lot of kids these days have this toy. It's quite popular. All my friends with babies have it.It's a toy providing light entertainment.I'm a trained musician and I disagree with some reviews saying that the quality of the sound is poor. Trust me, for a toy it's totally fine. You can still tell the instruments apart. You can't expect your baby to become a little Mozart just by listening to this cube 5 minutes a day anyway.Everything seems to function well. It's safe. I'm not scared to turn away for 30 seconds. I know that there are no sharp edges and my baby won't hurt herself.I'm not sure this toy carries a lot of educational / developmental value but it's nice."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My 4 year old son spotted this toy while we were out shopping for my 4 month old daughter. He couldn't help but play with this in the store and I thought that since my baby loves music so much she would probably enjoy this. I was a little put off by the price. (I paid a bit more than it is here) but it was worth it! My daughter was totally fascinated by the flashing lights and music and I even found myself and my son playing with it together! I'm sure as she gets older, she will really enjoy how interactive it is. Such a cool toy. And the best part? Unlike many other toys that make noise, this one is not annoying at all! The instruments sound so realistic that it's enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this and will probably give as a baby gift in the future."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got it for my 1 year old son.  He likes to push the buttons and listen to the music.  It's sturdy.  He's thrown it a few times already, and it bounced off the hardwood and still works fine.My only qualm with it is that it sounds like the batteries are dying.  Some of the music just isn't the greatest sounding.  Now, he doesn't care, but as a parent who gets to listen to this for seemingly hours when it's his toy of interest, it becomes grating.  I changed out the batteries and it sounded the same.  :-/Given that I know this, I also know that he loves playing with it, and that outweighs my feelings.  I'd get it again in a heartbeat if we ever lost this!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I always read reviews on this website and the Babies R Us site before buying a product. This product got great reviews so I bought it - I was not disappointed.I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old. The music and flashing lights immediately captured his attention and, as he grew, he played with it more and more. I keep it in his playpen and it's easily his favorite toy (besides his exersaucer and jumperoo). It keeps him entertained longer than other toys.I like that it's easily washable and has soft rubber-like corners (so, if baby falls on it, no sharp or hard corners to scratch himself on).I also think the music is nice - nothing too annoying like a lot of toys out there. And, with the click of the \"Orchestra\" side, the song changes.So glad I bought this!Update 6/10: My son will be 12 months old this weekend and he STILL loves his Mozart Cube!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Based on the myriad of reviews here, I purchased this toy when my triplets were several months old.  To be honest, they did not care for or notice it until they were closer to 8 or 9 months.  At that point, they realized they could start and stop the music by hitting at it.  All of a sudden, they took great interest in it.  It was also excellent when they were just learning to sit unassisted.  They could lean forward and balance on the cube while playing at the same time.Now that they have \"figured\" it out, the toy is a little less appealing.  I am waiting for the next enjoyment phase to kick in when they start noticing and playing with the different instruments.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that battery life is shorter than I would have expected.  While not bad, it seems to slow down more quickly than our other battery operated toys."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The toilet set is nice.  Other reviewers had complained that it did not fit on their toilet seats but I have three different toilets and it works on all three.  It is a nice design and my son love that Thomas, Percy, & James are all on his potty seat.  The one problem is that it does not have a splash guard.  The packaging says it was supposed to have a splash guard and handle to hang on the toilet handle.  It did not come with either of these and when I contacted the seller she claimed they were not supposed to come with the seat.  According to the packaging and description they were!  My son was attached as soon as it saw it so I couldn't return it.  Check when you buy one of these.  If you have a boy you may not want to buy this unless it has the splash guard."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think there was so much written about this that my head probably over rated it and now I'm discontent. My kids doesn't even look at it unless I'm on all fours like a dog and carrying it in my mouth. But, really, I don't think he's looking at the worm at all but thinking, &#34;Mommy has gone bow wow wow crazy.&#34; It's soft and not even cute. Just, it is. That's it. No magic, just what you see people. If what you see on the screen isn't making you scream and yell, it'll probably get the same reaction. You want more, prepare to crawl and bark."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have two of these gates and we couldn't be more pleased with them.  They took a little time to install (it was a snap the second time around), and they are as sturdy and secure as you can get.  We don't feel the slightest twinge of concern when our 1 year old leans against this gate at the top of the steps.  We know it's not going anywhere.  The gate is so simple to open and close.  A small child would not be able to do it on his or her own though.  The gate's design ensures that little climbers will not be able to get a lift.  We've tried lots of gates and this one is our favorite."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have four different gates in my house, and this, by far, is the most secure and stable. Therefore, it's at the top of my stairs... the most important place. I feel like I could even sit on that gate, and it's no going to budge.When we have guests over, they have trouble opening it, because you have to squeeze really hard, but I like that I have to squeeze really hard... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Our house is a front to back split. We have a lot of stairs. 5 openings to stairs! These gates have been great for my sanity. At first we bought a big playard gate that we opened up to cover two sets of stairs. I had to climb over that at least 100 times a day! Now we have these walk-through stair gates which are easy to use when holding the baby. Before we also had a gate that just expanded to fit the door way and was attached to walls. I was always concerned my daughter would fall down the steps if the gate gave way because she would pull herself up on it. These gates I know they are locked and they are much sturdier. I like that they slide back and forth; it's easier to get through entries.We used wood that matched our stair case so that we didn't have to drill into the post of our railing. I highly recommend this gate."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this set for my 4 year old and he loves it. The dinosaurs are colorful and there are a lot of them to arrange on the little background. I am happy with the number and look of the dionos, trees and volcanoes. However I give it only 3 stars because the background is small and very flimsy, and the set really smells bad. Every time we open the box there is a very strong unpleasant plastic smell coming from inside the box. Not sure if it's the box it's-self or the contents.  I thought I would air it out a bit so I left the lid off over night, but when I entered the room in the morning the whole room smelled terrible from it. I really don't like the idea of my kid inhaling the fumes of some unknown plastic chemicals each time he opens the set so it now stays open and stored in the garage.  We play with them outside and they work fine for that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "As I am wtitng this review my 5 year old son just re-discovered this set, since I had it at the top of the closet. He can play hours with this great quality dinosaurs he got for his b-day. He had a few more, big and small ones that he just added to this set, so it is pretty amazing what he does when he's playing with all of them. The quality of the mat is awful, but you really don't need the mat for this set."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I recieved a similar model to this walker, one without the electronic tray, for my daughter.  My only complaint is the rear wheels are difficult to roll.  Unlike the front wheels, the rear wheels are fixed and therefore can only roll straight forward or backward, not side to side.  This sometimes made for difficult maneuvering for my daughter. Overall, it is not a bad walker and I do plan on using it for my next baby due in January only because I do not want to purchase another one.  I would not recommend it though.  There are better walkers out there."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "How FUN and AWESOME!!! Got this for my grandson and still can't get over how bright and playful this is. Even I want to get in it and play! The built in activities on the side are the best. The squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby...but the other toys are super! It was so so so simple to put up!!! Love the bigger size, while not being overwhelming...those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most..."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I did some research before buying this playard and I am very happy i did.  It is the most colorful out there, easy to assemble and travel with. My baby is very particular, but she loves this playard.  It may to be obvious at first, but each of the walls has a bug with some functions.  for instance, the butterfly has wings that have foil inside to make squishing sound when you touch the,m.  The other bug, when squeezed, makes a sound, the third one, has rattles in its wings, and finally, the sun is a mirror (not a great one though). Given its price and the fact that it is being discontinued, I highly recommend getting one before they are off the market."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I give this a 5 start plus.My 6 month old Grandbaby  was put in this playpen yesterday for his first time.  It was obvious he really liked it by the big smiles and how his mind was preoccupied with the play items on the sides and bottom. It was a difficult first baby shots day and he was hurting on both legs. The graphics and sides toys kept him more focused on fun & he was able to get some temporary relief.  I know as he feels better he is going to enjoy his new & safe play space even more.Thank you Amazon for this colorful playpen choice at the lowest price and your excellent service. I'll positively be back."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this pack n' play.  I bought my son the pack n' play in rise n' shine with a bassinet.  What a waste.  This is the best pack n' play.  My mom bought one for her house and after I saw how much my son liked it I immediately went out and bought one for myself.  He loves the stuff on the sides and stares at the bright colors.  Also, it is a lot bigger than most of the other pack n' plays and will come in really handy for holding toys when my son gets a little older.  I definitely recommend this."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I like this pack n play. The only problem I have is that the middle kind of sinks in so unless your baby is a highly experienced sitter, it is tough for them to balance b/c it's slanted in towards the center. But the colors are pleasing and I didn't know this but the animals/sun embroidered on all 4 sides have little attachements that the baby can play with when their in the pack n play. That was a nice little surprise. My daugter loves the little wings on the bee b/c they have little rattles in them and they make noise when she hits them."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Although this isn't the lightest thing to carry, it is very serviceable! Ever since I purchased this play pen for my grandson, it has been used every weekday. It goes up about 8 a.m. and down about 4:30 p.m. It still looks as new as the first time we used it. I like the netting one the sides and the padding on the floor and rail. Also, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to set it up or take it down. And, it is bigger than the beds that turn into play pens in the Graco line."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "why do I love this play pan?  Very simple:1. Great quality material; sturdy and safe2. Large with lots of space (my grandson crawls around).  Can fit two kids!3. Very easy to assemble!3. Very colorful!  Bright beautiful colors.  My grandson looks at it and want to jump from my arms inside of the pan.4. The colorful patches around it are toys!The toys are:a) A beautiful butterfly with wings that when squeezed it make a dried plastic sound (he loves it)b) A lady bug that makes sounds alsoc) A sun with a mirror (safe for babies)d) A bee with playful wings, which also makes soundsI strongly recommend this play pan!  My daughter has another one, not Graco, that is half of the size.  It is nice but not eye catching like this one.It is worth every single penny!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "As soon as I opened the box, I could tell by the VOC's that this playard was treated with chemicals.  I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants.  In addition, some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl...like the entire face of the sun is PVC.  Why would you let your child play, let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew.  I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard.  It's the same size but quite a bit more expensive. The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants.  Definitely worth it to pay the extra $, knowing my children won't be exposed to harmful chemicals."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Buy this Pack N Play!!  All pros and no cons on this.  It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags. Only three parts, just the frame, the folding padded floor, and the carrying bag.  It is roomy, has plenty of padding, and has 9 legs for a strong and even base.  It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this product in all respects, except for the four paneled padded flooring.The design of it tends to not lay flat, once you put a sheet or a cover on it.This is a real flaw in the design.  AND, it is super important that you follow thedirections for putting this up, and be sure to use the velcro straps to securethe flooring pad in place.  Just get the help of another person to secure thevelcro straps, and you will be all set.  Otherwise, I do like the sturdiness of theside rails, and the bright primary colors.  Not the best for napping, as thebaby will continuously play with the built in side toys.  Some of the toysrattle and crinkle, and once baby finds the party, they will not want to laydown to nap.  But I still love this playyard so much, I bought two of them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am very thankful I chose this particular pack-n-play. I've seen the ones my friends have for their babies and I definitely got the best one!!! It also folds up easily and stores nicely. It is a little heavy, but they all are to me. It is sturdy and I think it will last. Sheets that fit this particular model are pricey, though, as it's not the average rectangular shape. Other than that, it is perfect! My daughter loves it and so do I!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I saw this playpen and thought it was adorable, bright colored, and fun. But I already have another pack and play and I read it was big and cost 100 dollars so I placed it on my private wish list. Well, to my lovely surprise, my mother had also independently seen this playpen on Amazon and bought it for my little baby boy. It is truly awesome and my son loves it! What I love about it? Well.......it's so nicely colored, screams cuteness all over, and it's very easy to set up and take down. I also love how spacious it is and I have fun playing peek-a-boo with my little one too! They say mothers know best..... and in my case.... that was true! Buy it, you won't regret it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I LOVE these because they are really convenient and easy to use. We have it by our pool (baby gated) under the overhang so we can enjoy the pool and sun and yet have LO out there playing or asleep at the same time. It is very convenient. I do not like the cleaning issues. It is hard to clean and though it is billed &#34;PACK N PLAY&#34; like it is the &#34;umbrella stroller&#34; of play yards, it is hardly that easy to just fold and run."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have had this pack n' play for a few weeks now and my son seems to enjoy it.  We use it for quick corralling, not prolonged play time.  He likes the toys on the sides, and I like that it is larger than most of the play yards I've seen, granting that my experience is limited.-It goes up and down VERY easily and quickly.-It is not very heavy for the size and sturdiness.  My parents have a Cosco playyard that they borrowed from a friend for when we visit.  Theirs is about half the size and seems almost as heavy.-The square shape on the TotBloc is nice, too because he can move around a bit in there and actually get somewhere instead of just rolling over once and hitting the end.-There is no listed weight limit on this, only a height limit.  That was a major deciding factor for my big boy!Overall I think it's a great product for the price."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Very big and roomy. Folds and sets up with ease. My only complaint is that although you can remove the bottom pad, the cover on it is not removeable or water proof, so there is no way to wash it and feel like it's \"clean\". There are sheets for this square play yard to purchase separately, but they aren't all that cheap and sheets themselves are not waterproof. So if your baby soils through his diaper onto the mattress, or your toddler has a barf-fest, good luck trying to get that smell out. You can \"spot clean\" with a warm rag, but lets face it. Poop and puke requires the washer. And you're not able to do that with this pad."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When my daughter started rolling, it was time for a little containment -- but Grandma bemoaned the fact that none of the standard play yards had as much space as the playpens of my childhood. (You remember, the massive wooden ones Moms would schlep from house to beach to park?) So looking for roomy containment plus the convenience of a portable play yard, there was only one viable candidate: the Graco PackNPlay Bugs. There's room enough for my 7-month-old and a hundred toys, it folds easily into its shoulder bag, cleans up in a snap and the price is great. Best of all, and unlike most play yards, it's FUN; my girl could spend an hour just batting at the colorful bugs on the walls (all make sounds) and floor or giggling at herself in the built-in mirror. And as a play space, it's a happy medium between a tiny play yard and a huge Superyard."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have this one and love it. My son typically doesn't like a pack and play or even to be in the crib too long. But, it is great for those days when they are small and you want to be outside at an outing and don't want to have to sit and hold your child all day. When my son was a little baby, we pulled out the mat and hooked up the toy dangler and he was amazed for hours. My son is now 14 months old and we recently took a 3 day vacation and took it along. We set it up in the hotel room and it worked perfectly. It also saved us the money of having to rent a crib at the hotel. He likes all the animals on the sides. Not to mention, what a dream to put up and take down. We have an older model pack and play and it is very hard to get the sides up and down. This one is so easy! Highly recommend."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Great set, but you'll need more nipples. At least 2 out of the 5 are Fast Flow, which I didn't use until my baby was 8-9 months old. The nipples are like $4 for a 2pk, so add that to the cost when comparison shopping.Other than that, I love these bottles! I don't have a single complaint about them. I do not use a bottle warmer. They do leak in the diaper bag when not kept upright, but I store mine upright, so that's a non-issue."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got this set at our shower and haven't needed any other bottles. My son started using them at about four weeks old and quickly outgrew the smaller bottles, but the set includes three larger ones, which is great. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that they don't include the medium flow nipples, just fast and slow. My baby was impatient with the slow flow and overwhelmed by the fast, so we had to purchase the medium ones separately. It's also a little irritating to have to keep buying the drop-in inserts, but it does cut down on the dishes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I only used these with my first child, now 7 years old.  I am pregnant with my 2nd and with certainty, will use these again.  Why they are amazing:1.  The liners are so convenient.  You use them then throw them away.  No bottles to clean (build up of disgusting old milk, especially on those long trips outside in the spring/summer), and you don't need a lot of bottles, I had two of each (2 x 4 oz and 2 x 8 oz bottles).2.  After mixing the formula or using expressed breast milk, simply squeeze the liner from the bottom of the open-ended bottle and all the air is out!  This lessens the gas and projectile vomiting.3.  Many options of nipples and they are the only thing you need to wash/rinse/sterilize.A lot of my friends use Dr. Brown and they rave about it, but after I talk about the Platex system, they are sold."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love these bottles and I reccomend them to everyone I know. First off you drop in a liner and that means there is less to clean up, no scrubbing the inside of the bottle. Second after I put the cap on I pinch the nipple open and gently push up on the liner and all the air comes out. That means the bottle won't give the baby gas! I also used the natural action nipple which the baby loved. I was also able to wash the nipple, the bottle and the ring in the top rack of the disheasher in a speacial  nipple rack I bought at walmart for $5. No fuss and minimal clean up."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are by far the BEST burp cloths around.  I got several different kinds at my baby shower.  I ordered these after reading the reviews because the ones I received at the shower were paper thin.  These are fabulous.  I buy them for every baby shower I go to now.  The middle panel is very thick and helps with a newborn that spits up a lot and those breastfeeding blunders that happen to a new mom.  I highly recommend them.  They are worth the money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got 2 of these at my baby shower (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) and I absolutely love them! They steam pretty quick and I like how you can keep pre-measured water on it. When baby's hungry I just grab the bottle from the fridge, grab the little flask of water that's attached, pour it in, and press the button. I've had to warm bottles twice sometimes but it's still faster than warming water on the stove or running the bottle under the faucet. Oh, I only do 2 oz. bottles for now."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been using this product for almost 7 months and yes, its true the little cups DO NOT WORK for warming bottles, I tried them for 1 week until I started using my own cup and I just pour the water in and now I know about how long it will take to warm, works great for me. I never had a problem with scalding my baby's mouth because I always check the milk temperature on my hand BEFORE giving it to the baby. Overall, I live in a two-story house and this warmer is a lifesaver for those early am feedings, I definitely don't want to go downstairs to warm a bottle, the product works consistently if you figure out how much water you need."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong.  I'd read the directions again and try again.  Another, stinking, melted bottle!  And the milk would be scalding hot.  If it didn't melt the bottle, the milk would still be cold.  I also had a problem with my playtex ventaire bottles leaking from the bottom into the warmer.  Then I had the smell of burned formula in the kitchen.  Oh!  And it melted that bottle too!I'm going back to the old fashioned way.  I'm going to heat water in the microwave and let the bottle soak in it.  It is faster, less messy, and lots cheaper.  Don't waste your time and money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is an awesome product!  Once you get used to using this product, it is a huge timesaver.  It took us three tries to get the amount of water right so the bottle would be the right temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  Before going to bed every night, we put two bottles and the ice pack in the cooler section.  When the baby woke up, we transferred one bottle to the warmer.  It was usually done warming before we finished changing a diaper!  You may want to order an additional ice pack so you'll always have one ready in the freezer.  This bottle cooler/warmer makes it easier at night when you want to get back to sleep as soon as possible!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can't speak highly enough about this chiller/warmer.  Every night I know I will not have to go downstairs to get a bottle, warm it, and bring it back up while baby is crying.Now, all I do is take the bottle from the chill compartment (complete with ice pack), and place it, with a capful of premeasured water, in the warming compartment and hit a button.While I change baby's diaper, the bottle is warming, and I am ready to go.  This equipment has been a godsend.  Actually, I can't think of any equipment that I could live without less.No complaints whatsoever about this great bottle warmer."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I use this everyday to heat up bottles.. I like how you can keep the frozen ice pack in with bottles to store and keep cool then just pour a little water into the front part to boil the water.  The directions are a little confusing with how much water to use, so i just have kind of learned how much water we need to use and just keep the bottle in there for 4-5 minutes.. you learn by trial and error.  Or if you want to save your money you can always just boil/microwave water and put the bottle in that.  I got this as a gift at my babyshower and I'm happy with it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If you are pumping breast milk or formula feeding this thing is a lifesaver.  We've used this warmer for 2 of our babies and love it.  It's super convenient to have 2 bottles nice and chilled.  If you read the instructions the warming is pretty much fool-proof but on occasion I've been sleepy and overwarmed a bottle.  As I rule I always test the temperature anyway so it's never been a real problem.  Make sure your lids are off or loosened when you warm the bottles (especially Dr. Brown's) or the milk will come out of the top and make breast milk caramel all over the heating element.  :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this bottle warmer for my second baby because it was a life saver for my daughter.  It stores 2 bottles in the compartment and comes with a small ice pack.  Do not store milk with this ice pack for more than eight hours.  The pack is fairly small and does not cool the milk for long.  I use a freezer pack and store one bottle at a time.  I would add a time chart just to know approximately how much time it takes to heat up a bottle."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The design is convenient, except for the water holding tubes which can be annoying to clip to the sides.  Otherwise, having a cooler right there is nice.  Note that it keeps the bottle COOL, and NOT COLD.  You can order replacement/extra ice pack on Tomy website - we keep 2 extras in the freezer as we constantly were forgetting to refreeze the one we had in preparation for a new night (they were $2 each).  Heating is a bit inconsistent and seems to be slower than the quick pro model by the first years.  Overall, good purchase and the price is great on amazon (you'll pay $30 at BRU)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can honestly say I love this bottle warmer because it is very convenient for those in a 2-story house.  We loved being able to keep the bottle cool and save the trip downstairs in the middle of the night.  Even when my son was sleeping through the night we still kept his morning bottle in his room and used this warmer to keep it cool.  But...I was very disappointed that my Dr. Brown's bottles were too wide for the warmer.  The taller Dr. Brown's bottle fit in the warmer but were too tall to fit in the cooler.  I ended up still using the cooler but storing the Dr. Brown's bottles in there without the nipple and cap on so they would fit.  My only suggestion would be to make the warmer wider so all bottles can fit."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We bought this because I work 2nd shift at a hospital so on the days I work, I don't get home until midnight and my husband has to get up with the baby. We exclusively breastfeed, so it's not like we can just put warm water in a bottle and mix it with formula. Living in a two story house, it's not exactly fun to get up in the middle of the night, go downstairs, warm up the water, then the bottle and go back upstairs to the baby. This system alleviates all of that!! We just put it in our upstairs bathroom with a bottle of breastmilk in the cooler part and when the baby gets hungry, just put water in the wamer and warm the bottle. It's quick and easy, which is always good in the middle of the night!!Some people said they had problems with temperature, but we didn't have any problems. Just read the instructions for the type of bottle system we use and it worked fine!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Our bed rooms are upstairs and I needed to have a second warmer and one which had a cooler.This is the best buy for the same reason.I simply love it and couldnt live without it.I have used it every single day so far .My son is now 5months and it works great I never timed how much time the bottle is in the warmer not I measured the water. I used to do it when I intially bought it but with a screaming infant in hands during night I stopped bothering about the measurements . even with such a rough use it still works great .never had a little problem with itBut I do make sure that I clean it throughly every week.The cooler part is awesome,saved me trips downstairs in the middle of the night.Being a working mom I am all about making things easy for me.This is what I recommend highly"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We had this warmer with our first child, but had parted ways with it by the time we had another child. We got the Tommee Tippee bottle warmer with our second child (because we used the tommee tipped bottles with her). After only a few months, I have gone back to this warmer. I love that it has the auto-off feature (which the TT one did not have). heats the bottles very quickly and you don't have to stand over it checking the temp every minute like with the TT warmer. Overall, I love this warmer."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This pump says it's rated for only occasional use, but I used it every day for six months.  The main thing I like about this pump is the ability to use it in any situation.  My husband and I traveled quite a bit with our son and I was able to pump in the car with the battery pack.  I use it so much that I doubt it will make it to our next child, but it's much better to buy this one twice for $80 than to buy one for $350!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this pump for occasional use since I am a sahm.  As recommended by our lactation consultants, I pump once a day.  I sit in bed with my daughter nursing on one side and me pumping the other.  I am able to get 6-8oz in one sitting.  When I pump w/o nursing at the same time, I am still able to get 4oz in 15-20 mins. Being a sahm, I cannot justify spending the $200 for a double pump when I just don't need that much help.I highly recommend this if you are a sahm and can pump whenever for however long.  I pump once a day and after a week of that I have 2 weeks worth of feedings(if giving once a day)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This pump is decent but wasn't enough for me. I am home with the baby so I didn't think I needed one of the larger double pumps since I am not working. However, I needed to pump to improve my supply in the begining and also while I was healing from a cracked nipple and the single pump just didn't cut it. I ended up purchasing the Medela Pump-in-Style and it works much better. Now I use the double pump to fill an evening bottle for my husband to feed to the baby. It would take twice as long with the single pump. I REALLY hate pumping so it is worth everything to get it done in half the time! I think this pump is only worth it if you will rarely need to pump or to use for just a few minutes before feeding the baby to relieve engorgement."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I received this pump as a gift.  I like it because it is electric.  I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading.  For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis.  However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump.  This works great.  It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples.  Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples.  It is a pretty good buy.  It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it.  :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have the larger, double Pump In Style but I wanted to leave that at work and still have something at home.  I used this to pump in the morning before going to work or if I was unusually full.  It's small and light and perfect for travel.  I'm now onto baby #2 and use this occasionally since I'm now home full time, but this works so well when I need it.  It's efficient and has lasted through 2 babies - Medela is a really great brand!  I wouldn't recommend this if you're pumping often from both sides - get a double pump, but it was a perfect supplemental pump for me."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This gate was perfect for our split-level home with the addition of one 24&#34; extension. It does the job of keeping the baby away from the stairs and the dog out of where she isn't allowed. My husband said it was very easy to install. The stay-open and auto-close features are great. I plan on buying another for the bottom set of stairs.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I do feel like it could be slightly sturdier for the abuse my three-year-old tries to give it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm quite happy with the gate, although I had to spend $250 to make it fit the bottom of my stairs. I removed the left 24\" panel, replaced with an 8\" extension, then inserted 3 more 8\" extensions on the right.  The $30 8\" extensions are way too expensive for what you get I think (and often arrive with scratches and rust due to the extra pole in the box).Like many Kidco gates, the instructions could have been better.  And it would be nice if the mounting hardware were metal instead of plastic.I used a 1/8\" drill bit to create pilot holes before screwing into my banister (rather hard wood).  While it may be obvious to some to do that, others might not know, or might not know what size drill bit to use.  I tried a smaller one at first but the screw was extremely difficult to attach.  Only when I used a 1/8\" drill bit did it go in."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great gate, and one of the few with the flexibility to accommodate non-straight spaces. It's pretty sturdy, the kids shake it sometimes but it hasn't ever opened or torn from the wall. The downside (or upside, depending on perspective) is that the gate is harder to open than the previous version. The magnetic catch is handy for a quiet but easy close. I got the extension, and it still stands pretty sturdy. No regrets on the purchase.BTW, this gate works really well as a separate space for an older child to play. We use it for my 3 year old to have a space on the main floor to play with toys without the baby able to interrupt. It's nice because he feels included with everyone else there, but doesn't get upset by his brother knocking down or taking his legos. Highly recommend for that purpose. Looks ok, good if you have white for trim, but ultimately, its a baby gate and looks like one."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I run an in-home daycare in a townhouse in addition to having my own young children.This gate is by FAR the sturdiest gate I've used and it is my absolute favorite.  I have 4 different baby gates.  We used it in a previous home to surround the fireplace but have it in use for keeping children in the playroom across a large doorway now.The gate is attractive, too!  I don't feel like I'm keeping the children \"trapped\" like with other gates.My only issue is that my oldest daughter figured out how to open the gate at the age of 2.  However, by then she understood and obeyed when I told her WHY she couldn't go through the gate.This gate is also taller than the average baby gate, which I love for my 12 month old climber.  She stacked pillows and climbed over the first gate I installed in that doorway."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have used this gate since our oldest started moving around. Now 3 years and another child later it is still functioning great! It still looks and works as well as on day 1.We picked this for the top of our stairs so we could have a \"landing\" at the top. We did not like other gates where you have to balance on the top stair, with a baby in your arms, to open or close the gate.It is easy to open, but not for little ones. My 3.5 year old still cannot open this on his own.I would buy this same gate in a heartbeat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have been using this system for about two months now.  We have 2.5 walls in what was once our dining room (now play room).  We used 4-5 extensions as well.  We bought this new, and it was easy to set up.  Be sure you install it into the studs - infants will pull up on the railing.  Kidco is pretty easy to work with.  They sent me free \"templates\" for the wall and I bought some screws (for another gate).I LOVE this system.  The quality is great.  I recommend it and would purchase another if needed."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wouldn't rate this as a baby necessity. It was nice to have at times, but our baby was never really addicted to it. I used the sounds as background noise when she was an infant, but not all the time. I was afraid she would get hooked on sleeping with white noise and wouldn't sleep any other way. The light was very helpful. I used that all the time for middle-of-the-night nursing sessions. It is very dim, so it is not bright enough to realy wake up baby (or you!) but you can see enough to avoid fumbling around."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was a little woried about buying a metal crib, but because it was mutch cheeper than the wooden moddles I baught this one. I love it and so does my son. We have had it for over a year. It hs traveled with us, Surved as play pin, and iven was used as the main crib for 3 monthes while we have no room for a big crib. I do wish it were a little easier to fold and ajust, although the litle buttons are stuck in mine it still works and is very safe. Should offer maybe 1 mor hight? I like that the bottom of the ligs are removeable, the description doesn't say that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this because my daughter has hated the pack n play from day one. She is now 13 months old and it was a major battle at each travel destination. When we decided to leave her with grandma for a few nights we knew we needed a crib.  This one is great because it is very sturdy.  The folding locks take a bit of getting used to, but they work well.  The mattress is thin and we purchased a mattress for it for about $20.  I bought portable crib sheets at Babies R Us and they work great.  My daughter sleeps in this like her regular crib and I think we will get a lot of use from it! It does fold nice and flat, but it is still large for the average car. We can put it in our Suburban.  It would be nice if they made one that has sides that fold in half for storage, but no one does! I love this crib."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!) My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal! I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib. And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My husband and I bought this changing table in the \"cherrywood\". It wasn't hard to put together--my husband put it together in a 1/2 hr or so.  It provides ample space for diapers, burp clothes, blankets, and other items you may need on it.  The table comes with a simple foam mattress, which is easily wiped off with a cloth.  We've been using it everyday for nearly 16 months, and still good as new.  No problems encountered at all."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a good solid dressing table.  We received it because my in-laws found it at a consignment shop, so I can't comment about other reviewers' concerns regarding assembly.  The table serves the purpose and is a good value for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on a dressing table.  We didn't feel that we needed a fancy dressing table and instead opted to purchase a more expensive crib, which is really the focal point of the nursery.  The dressing table has two shelves that are quite convenient for holding supplies.  I placed baskets on those shelves to hold diapers, etc."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).  They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket. There was nothing &#34;UltraSoft&#34; or &#34;UltraThick&#34; about this mattress pad, if you could call it that. It's probably the first amazon purchase, after a couple hundred, that really left me disappointed. You're better off putting a thick, soft blanket under your baby's crib sheet if padding is what you're going for. As a mattress protector, it might be good. As a quilted pad to make it softer- it's useless. The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to. My 7 month old wouldn't have even noticed a difference. He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he's older. Guess I'll have to keep looking."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad. I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic. I can't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product, let alone sleep on it! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover. The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking. They are correct! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers, I think there must be a problem with production. Maybe some are leaky, some are not. Fact is, out of ten bottles, five of mine were leaky. I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex. They are half the cost and never leak"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These bottles are a good choice if you're breastfeeding, but have to introduce a bottle. My son has never had a problem going from the breast to this bottle and back to the breast again.Also, after months of frequent use, I have never experienced the leaking problem with these bottles mentioned by some other reviewers. I also know of other moms who have used these for more than a year and no leaks either. I have even taken the tops apart and put them back together and still no leaks."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are the widest bottles that I have seen available.  They are well made and easy to assemble.  I sterilise mine every day and there has been no fading of level markers (a problem with another make I tried.) or discolouration of bottles.  They come with a whole range of accessories like handles and sippy cup teats for older babies and so will go from Day 1 right through to when you no longer need sippy cups.  The best thing for me is the fact that you can get specially designed teats that allow for thicker liquids (my son had rice in his milk at 8 weeks (with Doctors approval) because he is so big (90th Percentile) and was so very hungry.  The Adjustable Flow teat has a slot cut instead of a hole and so the flow depends on the way the teat is lined up with the babies nose.  What a fantastic idea and such a godsend for us.  They also hook up directly to an avent breast pump either the manual or electric."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i have zero complaints about these bottles. wish i had bought them in the first place (i started out with the playtex nurser system). they may be pricy compared to other bottles, but, you don't have to buy liners for these bottles. my daughter found these bottles much easier to hold herself than the playtex ones and these have a bigger selection of nipple flow to choose from (besides slow and fast, where fast for playtex really just means not so slow), so i put them away and got more of these, and my daugher was a much happier baby.what i found with the leaking some people complain about: if there is any liquid in the seal it will leak. this problem can easily be solved by wiping the inside of the ring that holds the nipple and the outside rim of the bottle with a dry rag, and if it squeaks when you screw the lid on, you're not going to have any leaks.hope this helps!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "In 2000 when my first son was born, I bought the Avent bottles to go with my Isis breast pump (which I LOVE) because everyone raved about how they were the best.  The first time my son tried the bottle with a newborn nipple he couldn't get anything to come out.  After trying for awhile, I finally called Avent and they told me to move up to a different size nipple.  These bottles worked out relatively well after that dilemma.  With me second son I assumed I would use the bottles again and tried the newborn nipple with the opposite result.  The flow was way too fast for him and he would choke and spit out half the milk every time I would try to feed him. I finally gave up on Avent bottles and went with the much cheaper and economical Evenflo Classic bottles (on the recommendation of the lactation consultant.)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "In my opinion the Avent bottle system is superior to any other product on the market. The disposable system works great for storing and freezing milk and it's convenient for Mom's on the go. My only mistake was not buying enough bottles in the beginning when my son ate eight times a day. The bottles are designed to reduce gas, and seem to do the job. The one slight annoyance with the system, you have to place the ring on the lids directly on top of the nipples; otherwise the bottle has a tendency to leak.F.Y.I. - I purchased the adjustable flow nipples when my son turned three months old as recommended, but nowhere in the product information does it tell you that you are supposed to line-up the Roman numerals of the nipples directly in line with your baby's nose to adjust the flow. This makes sense of course, but I had to call the 1-800 number to discover this 'little' detail."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These bottles are pretty good.  The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby.  She makes quite a mess while drinking from these.  However, the bottle is nice and durable.  The nipple and caps fit snug.  Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers.  You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage.  I like that.  My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've only tried the 9oz bottles and they leak for me alot. It's really annoying since I spent so much money thinking that they were quality. They also make alot of noise when my son eats. And he doesn't like the nipple, it's too thick for him to get a good suction. One thing that is good is these bottles don't give him gas which I've tried cheap bottles and he gets gassy with them. After trying alot of bottles the only brand I have absolutely no problem with is the Dr.Brown bottles. They are just the best. But they have extra parts to clean which is a pain."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I admit it: I am impressed with Avent bottles! They are easily one of the baby products capable of handling extremes without a blink. Example: microwave sterilize them and after a couple of minutes, pour a stream of recently boiled water; mix with formula and put next to the ice bin in the freezer for five minutes. Do this with your average bottle a few times and be ready to say bye-bye to them, but Avent bottles hold on strong and in the process also happen to offer the best bibs in the market (the ones that best mimic the nipple, thus giving your baby the least gas, if you feed the bottle perpendicular to his/her mouth). No wonder they've been voted among the best baby products for several years in a row!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I understand that some people might have a problem with this bottle type. If you screw the top on crooked at all or too tightly - you may have issues. But if you take a second and make sure that you are screwing on the top properly - you might have a leaking bottle once every 30 or 40 tries. I have used 4 of the other top brands and am very pleased with Avent. The Brownies are really good too - but just too hard to clean on a regular basis. If you only use a bottle once in a while - use browns - but if you use them a lot - get Avent. Only way to go."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Unlike a couple of reviews I read, the only times I've had problems with the Avent bottles leaking is when I screwed the cap on badly or had the nipple in wrong.  Otherwise, they are perfect.  We were told that there may be &quot;nipple confusion&quot; if a baby goes from back and forth from breast to bottle but we haven't had a problem whatsoever.  These nipples are enough like the breast that he does just fine.  (His mouth is open wider than other bottles because he puts the whole nipple in his mouth, like the breast.)  I also use (and love) the Avent breast pump so you can pump right into the bottle and attach a nipple.  It couldn't be easier."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used these bottles with my son and loved them!This bottle system was excellent and my son almost never had any gas with them like he did with some others I tried out.  He took right to them as a newborn and I didn't have to encourage him like I had to with others.The wide mouth is so nice and makes them so much easier to wash.  The nipples and bottles are extremely durable and held up for a very long time.  As my son got older, I had other bottles I would use for him, but he always preferred the Avent ones.I never had problems with leaking like I had read about, so I don't know much about that.  But there was absolutely no leaking here!There is a great range of accessories that go with this bottle as well, including sterilizers and breast pumps.  Everything was compatible with my Avent breast pump and it made it a dream to use.I am pregnant with my second and Avent is all I am going to buy for her."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "these dont require that extra ring to make it leak proof. i had the originals and they work great too but i like the big capacity but not big size of these. they will leak out of the nipple if it is upside down so if your baby feeds themselves, watch that they dont drop it and wedge it somewhere upside downupdated review***** i love avent NATURALLY bottles and trusted that is what i was getting when i looked at all 12 customer photos. well i broke these babies out to use em last night and they are reg avent bottles with the stupid ring on the inside that makes it not leak(something not needed in the other bottle)the plastic used is also completely different. it isnt the hard clear plastic that doesnt cloud or stain, it is the dull non see through plastic that feels pliable. and the oz numbering on these reg bottles is the kind that will scratch and rub off easily. so disappointed that i now have to return these :("}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love these bottles.  My Amelia is hardly every gassy with them.  As for the leaking issue, it is Not the bottle, it's the user!Bottle use de-mystified: you MUST  make sure that the top of the bottle and its threads are DRY and the flange of the nipple on the inside is dry as well.....then when you tightly screw on the cap it should make a soft squeak sound that perfects the seal. If either are wet or have milk on them (like when you open it to re-fill a partially full bottle) you must re-dry the threads and nipple before screwing closed. Motto: \"IF you don't hear a squeak, it's gonna leak\".  Good luck."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.  Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.  The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.  We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.  The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.  Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Avent brand of bottles is an outstanding product.  For those experiencing leaks, it is simply because the bottles are an interlocking system and must be screwed on properly.  I have had no problems using these bottles, and yes I have experienced an occasional leak which I notice while I'm shaking the bottle because I have not screwed the cap on properly.  These are well worth the price paid.  I have tried both Dr. Brown's and Playtex VentAire and find the Avent products to be superior to both of these.  Highly recommended by this mom!Update March 06:  one more great feature about the Avent bottles -- they sell a sippy cap that can replace the nipple, so your investment goes into toddlerhood with no need to buy additional sippy cups!  They are leakproof, and come in a 2 pack just as the replacement nipples do.  I have found them in Toys R Us, since my local Babies R Us does not carry them.  Still a great product in my book!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have to agree with reviewers, the nipple of the Avent bottles is great. It's obvious watching my baby that he latches on similar to the way he does on the breast.The problem is that the bottles leak like crazy. My little guy ends up wearing as much milk as he drinks. I've tried all of the suggestions, but have had no success in making the bottle leak proof. I've had to go out and buy different bottles with nipples I don't like as much just so that I don't have the mess."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great. He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast. We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you. So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been using nothing but these bottles for the first 6 months of my baby's life. Yes they WILL LEAK if you don't pull the nipple all the way through. But that is an easy fix! I never had an issue with my baby falling asleep during a feeding or the flow being too fast. And colic has never been a problem here either.I breastfeed and pump for my baby and I found that she went easily from bottle to breast as early as 2 weeks old. I attribute it to the unique design of the nipple which encourages her to open her mouth wide instead of tucking her lip in to suck on a smaller nipple.Also these can be converted to sippy cups. They are very durable as well and so easy to clean. I threw all the other bottles I got as a shower gift right out in the trash - my baby will not drink from them."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really like this pump.  Works great sort of a pain to clean but easier than having to clean tubing on an electric.  The bottles however are junk.  After one use they leaked from under the plastic disk.  EVERY bottle I have leaks.  In order to stop it is a pain.  I pull up on the nipple and roll it around clockwise to make sure it's in there right, then I use a rubber gripper and tighten the crap out of it so it won't leak.  What a PAIN!  I sold my lot on ebay and replaced them w/ the Playtex vent air.  I did save one bottle so I could pump into it though."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter was in the NICU the first day of her life, and then the special care nursery the next few days, so I had to use the hospitals electric medela dual breast pump to express milk. i returned home and rented the medela for a month and hated it. It HURTS my nipples. My friend got me this Isis breast pump kit and I tried it. I LOVE it! I used it since my daughter was about 2 weeks old. I doesnt hurt my nipples like the electric breast pump does as I can control it with every squeeze. It doesnt hurt my wrist (as one might think.) I only supplement my daughter with one bottle of EBM at night. It takes me 10-15 minutes and I can express 5 ounces with this pump! I LOVE IT!Oh, and it is virtually silent so I can pump one breast as I breast feed my daughter on the other!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It's a great manual pump, but it's just a manual pump after all. Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk. It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day. However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies (like the time I forgot my other pump at home) or for out-of-office meetings (because it's small and discrete). It's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I read all the reviews on this pump but still wasn't convinced about buying this pump. I originally purchased a Gerber pump and it worked until it cracked. I asked a lactation consultant what kind of pump she'd recommend and she recommended Avent and Medela. I needed a pump in my price range so I chose the Avent.I like how the suction mimics a baby's latch but milk gets stuck everywhere and it leaks all over the place. The pump also makes an annoying squeaking noise and sometimes I lose suction. I'd recommend this pump over Gerber though. I will give it credit though, it's a lot easier to take apart and clean."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Although I haven't been using this pump for very long, I've been able to get very good results. Of course, pumping takes practice but this pump works great for beginners. It is very easy to set up and clean...making it easy to take along. I also like that the bottles fit onto the pump-nothing extra to buy (and clean). I also have an electric pump but prefer this pump when I am home during the day. I find that I can more quickly get it ready and am able to pump one side as soon as my baby is finished nursing on the other side. I definitely recommend having a manual pump, even if you plan on or already have an electric."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon, then this is a great pump for you.  I found it to be an incredible nusance, so I borrowed a friend's Medela electric pump.  Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers!  Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to (and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise).  With our next child, I will definitely be buying electric!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Avent pump in this kit is very good. I also like the carrying bag, which is subtle and good for work - it can even be used as a lunch box when you are done breastfeeding.However, the nipples in this kit are very hard and the speed on the slow flow was far too fast for my newborn (when I tested the milk on my wrist, I didn't get a drop - it squirts). There are better bottles out there too, that keep the baby from getting too much air. Instead of the Avent bottles, I have started using the Playtex nurser system - which means I pump into the Avent bottles and pour them into the nurser (the Playtex system sells a kit with a pump adapter - but it does not work with Avent). This has worked fine for me, though if I were not pumping at work I would not pay the extra money to have the kit. Since I pump at work, the insulated bag is helpful."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my \"let down\" and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "After trying a dual electric pump that was very uncomfortable for me I tried the Isis berast pump and never looked back. I could not control the suction with the electric pump and,  however with the Isis I was able to control the pressure and was able to completely empty both breasts in less than 20 minutes total. The cushioning made the pump very comfortable. And my hand never got tired from manually pumping. I used this product years ago with my daughter and I am adding it to my registry for my second child. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to continue breast feeding.Follow-up: My youngest daughter is now six weeks old and I still love this pump. Its a moust-have for breastfeeding mothers."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My friend gave me her pump when she was finished with it, I just boiled all the parts, and then threw them in the dishwasher.  Anyway, the pump is fine for a bottle, I only use it once in the day, but during the pumping time it will lose it's suction or you have to get it on just right before it will really get the milk quantity you want.  It took me about 4 times (4 days) to figure out  how the pump suction needs to be for myself.The other complaint I have with the pump is the parts that screw together to make the pump complete come unscrewed throughout the pump time.  (the bottle, and the other screwed on piece to the pump.)  This is really anoying while you're trying to pump.Overall it's ok, but I think I can find another one."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This a necessary item. I hated to have to cover my coffee table and have my house look baby proof(I even avoided it for a while) but after two big bumps i bought this item.Its easy to install and I like that I could cut it to the size i needed. It came with the corners which is great. The tape it uses is perfect because it really stays put. My baby has tried to pull at it and it doesn't come off.This color is light enough that doesn't call too much attention in my living room."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I needed a solution for a sharp tile step down into my living room- every time I stepped down I envisioned my baby cracking her skull on that :( I was hesitant to buy this, though,  because I was skeptical that it would stick and chocolate seemed like the wrong color to match my tile. It sticks really well- we'll see how it holds up over time- and the color looks great against my taupe tile. It really doesn't look cheesy at all. We're going to use the corner pieces on a table of mine and I've already checked the color there too. Not great against some sort of reddish brown wood, but miles ahead of the hideous Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper. This stuff gives a perfect fit since it's cut to fit. The expandable thing doesn't fit the sizes listed (no way it will work on a 90 inch table) and it looks like a pair of hand-me-down training pants from the 1970s."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Other reviews have said that this product is difficult to cut, but I used a pair of ordinary scissors and didn't have any problem whatsoever. Also, the foam is a bit stretchy, so your measurements don't have to be exact. I cut the foam a bit short and then just stretched it to fit. While it's true that the tape won't last forever, it is also true that it won't leave a mark on your furniture once you want to remove it permanently. Simply apply more double-sided tape when the adhesive breaks down. Easy!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this for the breakfast nook around my marbel countertop.  Since I don't have kids yet (we are adopting) I can't really comment about the durability.  However, they seemed to stay on tight when I applied the tape to the top and bottom on the inside of the foam.  If not I will do what some of the other posters suggested.It wasn't difficult to cut the foam to length.  I just started with one corner edge, measured the long foam piece, and then cut the foam with scissors (just alittle bit longer then what I though I needed.  It cut slightly jagged, but since I cut on the long side adjusting it wasn't a problem.  The finish product doesn't look funny or leave any gaps at all."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this table edge and corner guard to edge a window in my son's playroom. The window was level with the daybed he often played on, and I had visions of him cracking his head. I lined the edges of the windowsill. This works well. My son is a pretty good listener, and I kept telling him not to touch or pull the foam off, it was there for a reason, and it is still there two months later. It will come off very easily if pulled, just a forewarning. But I like this product and would use it again."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Easy to put up, takes a bit of time, but overall fairly easy!  Wasn't too crazy about the type of adhesive that comes with it, but I look at it this way.... I'd rather re-finish my wood coffee tabble than deal with all the boo-boos and broken teeth it(my coffee table) has caused! (I have three kiddos and this coffee table has taken a tooth from two of them before they were 2yrs old)  I'm hoping this protector will prevent that with my third little one! Personally I hate this coffee table, but my husband will not get rid of it... I put this protector on my fire place too, and it looks and feels wonderful.  I like that it streches a bit, and I had plenty of adhesive left over! I rate this product 4 stars, definitely worth the price just know that adhesive is going to be a consern when I remove the product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "You know when you're child free and buy great furniture? You can't fathom the day when you'll have to apply foam to your beautiful wood table so your child doesn't go head first into the sharp corner?  Those days are now a distant memory and you bite the bullet and apply a foam guard.  Then you go to take it off because your child has spilled parmesan cheese and... what...the? The wood came off.  The WOOD came off.  I expected to have to use some Goo-Be-Gone to get off the adhesive but this actually destroyed the table.  Not like a dent that could be sanded.  I piece of wood literally splintered off.  So, while this product will protect your kid's noggin, don't put it on a piece of furniture you like."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These have a nice amount of cushioning to protect my 9 month old daughter as she &#34;cruises&#34; around our coffee table.  They come with a good amount of adhesive tape, which is why I purchased this brand over others.  It is difficult to get them to stay adhered without putting adhesive tape on BOTH sides.  Once I put it on both sides, it works much better.  Because this item is also a bit &#34;stretchy&#34; it was tricky to measure it exactly right.  So, we have small gaps between the pieces which aesthetically isn't great, but it still protects my daughter.  If I had the time and money, I might purchase again and install it better knowing what I know now, but it works fine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child, however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it doesn't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to.  (I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table).Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes (must be completely flat to hold at all)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This product comes with special double-sided sticky tape to attach the guards. It&#699;s easy to apply to the inside of the guards and easy to attach to the corners and surfaces that you want to use. For us we have an extremely sharp edge in our shower and baby crawls around so we didn&#699;t want him to slip and fall on the edge. We put the guard on the edge and it stays even though it gets wet every day as we shower. I used the table corners for the corners of low window sills that are in his play area and it works well to protect him from falling on them and doubles as a teether. lol He loves chewing on it! It&#699;s a very soft, spongy material. Hopefully there&#699;s no BPA in it because it&#699;s constantly in my son&#699;s mouth!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable \"chucks\" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Very convenient - I have a one year old and I babysit a one year old. I'm definitely not going to spend 100 bucks or more on a double stroller, but since I found two umbrella strollers on sale for 10 bucks each, my double stroller was only 30 bucks! It handles well. When you put the connectors on, make sure they're tight, and even so it will seem like there's too much slack for it to really move, but it does work. Just give it a go. :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are easy to put on and take off.  They work well to connect two umbrella strollers.  The rubber inserts do fall out easily, so I can tell these may not last long.  They only work with one thickness of bar so they are not compatible with all strollers.  I use a combination of these for the top connection and a different brand for the bottom that are adjustable since my stroller bars are wider at the base and I connect in 4 places instead of 3 for a sturdier connection."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was a bit hesitant to buy this booster, although it came highly recommended.  I felt like it was overpriced and essentially offered nothing...boy, was I wrong!  I've been using this booster for 2 years now.  It has been used by my 3.5 year old and his 2 year old brother.  Both of them LOVE it.  The seat is comfortable for them to sit on, unlike the hard plastic seat we had before it.  It doesn't slide around on the chair, and it is SO easy to clean.  I also like that it is easy to take along if we're headed to grandma's house.  No extra straps, trays, or pieces to worry about! I don't have a single complaint with this seat after 2 years of use...it is well worth the money!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great booster and is effective for it's job--but there are a few things that could make it an even better seat.  I can't use this booster in my home because it is made out of a rubber substance that my kids LOVE to pull apart!! My young toddler likes to bite and take chunks out of the booster seat.  If you have an aggressive chewer in the house, you may want to think about this--this material is highly attractive to chewers!  Also, the seat does not come equipped with straps.  I had to switch to another booster with straps due to some safety issues associated with this also."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "For the older toddler, this booster seat is more comfortable and spacious than the hard plastic booster seats with trays.  The hard plastic seats slide around on wood chairs and never feel stable, even when strapped around the chair.  The trays don't leave enough room for a bigger child's legs.  However, this booster seats is soft and cushiony.  It feels stable on wood chairs, and it allows the child to sit at the big people's table.  Obviously, it's not as good for the young infant or younger toddler who needs a tray to contain the mess, but it's definitely better for the older toddler who knows how to eat neatly off a plate or bowl.  The older toddler hopefully is also well-trained enough to know not to jump around in the seat because it's not attached to the adult chair."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We love this booster. My 3 year is still using it and I think he started using it around 18 months or so. We have solid oak chairs and didn't have the problem of other reviewers. It sits in the same chair almost all the time and there's no residue. Maybe it has more to do with the chair finishing. Your chair does need to be made of something to \"grip\" this chair, such as a wooden chair. I tried to take it to my dad's house and he has cooshy leather chairs, and it didn't work. It cleans extremely easily, holds him securely, and works better than I could have expected."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great product.  They do what they are supposed to do, at least on my desk.  My desktop/corners consist of a wood laminate, with a very smooth surface, so these things stick very well.  However, I have not attempted to take them off yet, and i'm sure a little 'Goo-Gone' or rubbing alcohol will do the trick when the time comes.  I will be dissapointed if they harm some of the finish, but then again you can't put a price on protecting your precious child from severe injury, which can easily occur when their head hits a table or desk corner!  For this 'peace of mind', I give this product 5 stars.  One more thing... there is NO substitute for proper and constant child supervision."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm not judging anyone else, but I was very surprised when I read how many people wrote about these coming off or being pulled off. I guess my daughter never tried very hard, but they are really stuck tight. I've had one set for about 14 months, and bought a 2nd set for another table about 8 months ago, and they're not going anywhere.  I can't speak to them hurting the finish of the wood, since I've never tried to take them off.  They don't look too bad either, since the dark color matches most of my furniture. I do wish they came in more colors for some of my lighter wood."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I considered this when it was full price, 50 bucks.  When I saw it for 25, I just had to get it.  I took it back the next day because the latches that keep the buttons away from Baby broke and the buttons wouldn't work.This second try has been better.  I found it for 12.50 and decided that it would make a gift for someone else if it didn't work for me (man, I can be cruel :)  This time, it seems to work pretty well.  All the buttons work.I did have a little trouble with the light because when the light is on, the button is pressed in.  I have fingernails, so the button can be a bit tricky until you get the hang of it.I am glad I decided to try this product again, but I wouldn't have paid the 50 bucks for it.  If you can't find it on sale, get a regular CD player: they plug in and are cheaper."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have been using this seat for about 6 months with our toddler boy.  I love how it attaches to the seat easily and securely.  Once it's on, it doesn't budge, but it removes easily.  However, if our son sits down to pee, he gets pee all over the place.  Even with him holding his private part down with his finger.  The cheap \"bob the builder\" toilet seat does a better job of keeping the pee in the toilet while he is sitting.  I wish they would make the seat more compatible with boys."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've tried several different potty seats and this is the best by far:1)  Fairly easy to clean, integrated design.  Love that it wipes clean if it gets messy2)  Built in pee guard for boys...  We had another seat with a snap on attachment, and of course it got lost while our daughter was using it.3)  very sturdy and stable on toilet.  This seat positively sits on the toilet, and my son is comfortable on it for even long periods of timeWe tried the soft plastic ones, and ironically he complained a lot more about those being uncomfortable than this one.  Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I definitely, wholeheartedly recommend the Baby Bjorn toilet seat reducer.This seat is contoured in a way that makes it comfortable to sit on and boy's pee goes into the toilet.There is a kind-of dial thing at the back that you turn to make the seat fit snugly and securely onto your toilet so it does not shift when your little one is on it.The handle at the back means you can hang it on a little hook if you wanted to stick one of those removable 3M hooks to your wall.I also give bonus points for the colour- white without a licensed TV character in sight :-)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've tried a few different brands of potty seats, and this is by far our favorite. It stays in place when kids climb on and off instead of slipping or tipping like some other seats. Unfortunately we changed our toilet seat/lid combo to one of those slow close plastic ones that has the removable hinges for easy cleaning, and the Baby Bjorn training seat doesn't fit it. Also, after about three years (and a couple of kids) the black rubber handle on the back started to break, but I consider that minor wear and tear. Overall, I'd recommend this seat above others on the market. It safe and looks nice."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer to potty train my son.  He likes using it, and the splash guard in the front works.  There is an adjustment wheel located at the back of the seat by the handle to adjust the Toile Trainer to the size of the regular toilet seat.  We have elongated Kohler toilets and the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer adjust to fit snugly.The reason I am rating it 4 stars is the adjustment wheel started slipping after a few removal and reinstallations.  Now if I have to reinstall the seat, I pre-adjust it and then position it onto the regular toilet seat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old, and we've reduced the number of diapers significantly, with very rare #2 diapers, woohoo!!! of course i had to hold the baby, but at 11 months, holding is discouraged. there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip, but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets, though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly. (but then if your kid isn't too young, you probably won't need a trainer for a small toilet.) i even take this to other people's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training, and this product enabled me to accomplish that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter was scared of falling in the toilet when she first started potty training.  She was so scared that she would wait until the very last second to go and she would have accidents because of it.  With this training seat she fit perfectly and her fear was over.  We ended up purchasing 3 of these because they worked so well.I am only giving it four starts though because we did find that she would hurt her booty and &#34;parts&#34; some times when she would try to slide up on it.  I understand why the bump in the front is there (to stop kids from peeing out the front of it) but if it could be made with a softer material (at least on the front) it might make it easier and less painful for kids to get on and off of."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have 3 boys and this is the solution for our needs. I like it is made of hard plastic instead of the foam type seat, easy to clean. It has a nice shape for sitting. As far as a boy doing number 1 while sitting on the potty, he has to lean forward or you will have a mess to clean up. That doesn't seem to be a big deal to the boys. It has a nice loop on the top so we can hang it on the toilet with the potty hook and it is adjustable to fit different potty hole sizes. Seems very durable. I have one in every bathroom."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Love this thing.  Relatively cheap, comes in various colors, has an adjustment knob to 'fit' various toilet sizes, the hooks allows you to hang it (added a tacky hook to bathroom wall) and best of all it doesn't have the creavises other seats have - let me explain.  Had another potty seat that was 'cushioned' -&#62;  not sure why a kid needs a cushioned seat, it is not like they will be sitting reading the newspaper for ten minutes at a time - anyway, it didn't take long for the vinyl cushion to get pee and other 'gunk' stuck between the cushion and the plastic rim - and then you have to look at it each time to put it on the toilet.  This is a better option."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This seat has such great reviews, I didn't think I could go wrong with it. We've had it for over 2 years now, and I'm getting fed up with cleaning up the mess. At first the splash guard wasn't tall enough, and everything ended up on the floor and on my son's clothes. Now, that he knows to tuck it inside and keep his legs closed, the mess is on the regular toilet seat. I have to clean the toilet seat every time I lift the BabyBjorn potty seat. Also, it would have been nice not having to remove the seat every time, and just flip it instead.Anyway, an overpriced item in my opinion. And I can't believe it has such great reviews. Maybe I'll change my mind about it once my daughter is old enough to start using it. But for now, not very impressed."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When we were potty training our daughter, my friend told me that the toilet trainer that goes on toilet might be better to use over the one that sits on the ground because if they get too used to the one on the ground, they may be scared to go on the toilet since it's higher up.  So we bought this one and even if they are still too small, you don't have to worry about them falling into the toilet because of the way it's made.  My son is 11 months and he can sit on the toilet on this and we don't worry about him falling in.  He may try to get off but we just sit there too and bring toys or things for him to do while he sits there and then he doesn't try to climb off."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Haven't had the opportunity to need this yet as we are still utilizing the baby potty seated on the floor as our guy is too little to get on the regular potty yet.  However, wanted to get everything together and ready when we will need it.  This seat is very well made and really like that it is all one piece so there is no need to worry about bacteria collecting around a \"snap on\" deflector (for boys).  Purchased 2 of these, one for myself at my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law at theirs, as they are in the process of potty training our grandson.  It was easy to adjust to fit our regular seats, and I now have it on a hook next to the regular potty when the time comes that we are ready to use it.  I also purchased the stool and potty book...and am ready whenever my kiddies are.  Highly recommend this seat as it very well made."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This lid is great for my petite 3 year old to use. It adjusts to fit most toilet lids- does not fit well on grandma's already contoured seat. This is a hard, but perfectly contoured seat for a little bottom. We have the cushioned one, with little ducks which is nice, but this is really a step up. It has the nice guard in front to help minimize over shoot. I really liked this one enough to purchase a second for trips to grandma's. It is strong, sturdy, easy to clean. It comes in other colors, but I only have white. It is great how it adjusts to fit snugly with my lid underneath. Since my daughter is petite she has a hard time getting high enough to just sit- she has to \"shimmy\" and this snug lid is very safe for her to shimmy onto with out moving. Worth the extra money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this for use while visiting my parents. It is okay for something like that, but I would not use it for much else.I have a very active 2 year old who does not always want to take time to sit on the potty. She can easily scoot accross the floor while seated on it.It might be good if you have a very early potty trainer or one on the (very) smaller side. My daughter is about 35 inches tall and her knees come to her chest while seated on this."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this potty after reading the reviews and trying to decide on the little or big potty.  I didn't think the small one would be a problem, since  my 18-month old son is on the small side.  However, after receiving it, I would only recommend this potty to those who are doing EC or for travel. My son seems to like it, but he looks huge on it and it will not last for long.  It also slides all over the tile floor like someone mentioned.  I really wish I would have bought the Bjorn big potty."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We take this little potty with us everywhere.  I actually purchased online from Amazon specifically to find the one piece BabyBjorn Little Potty (BBLP) after my friends raved about it.It now lives permanently in the back of my car, so that my toddler can have easy access to a potty when we're on the go.  I've also taken this on planes and trips in our carry-on, so that we would have access to a potty ...even if there was not a bathroom available.  With little ones it is so hard for them to wait, and this helps keep them potty-independent.Also, if you do infant pottying or elimination communication, this is one of the &#34;must-have&#34; pottys.  The seat is a little on the smaller side compared to the standard little pottys you'll find at Toys R Us or wherever ...which makes it ideal for little ones (I am talking 1 year or younger)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is perfect for my 20 month old.  She can sit on it on her own.  It is VERY small.  Imagine a gallon of milk cut in half.  My daughter is small for her age and it fits her perfectly.  There is no problem emptying it.  We just add a small amount of water and dump it in the toilet.  Then a quick rinse and dump that in the toilet.  This is much better than seats on the real toilet that she feels uncomfortable on.  She is relaxed on this and that makes all of the difference.  It is perfect for us, but be aware it is small."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a no frills, easy to clean, comfortable potty...just as a potty is supposed to be. I wanted something that would be comfortable for her little bumbum but nothing that would distract her from the job at hand. The price was definitely a plus as well. She is 2 1/2 years old, at 29 lbs and 34 inches and is on her way to becoming fully potty trained. Cleaning is pretty easy, I wipe with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes 4-Pack: 1 Fresh Scent, 2 Lemon Fresh, 1 Orange (78 Wipes Per Canister - 312 Wet Wipes Total), wash with hot water and spray withClorox Anywhere Daily Sanitizing Spray, 22-Fluid Ounce Bottles (Case of 9)and let dry or wipe dry."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We bought this potty chair after much research and also owning another one - a Winnie the Pooh Potty chair with a removable urine shield that pops off too easily and just asks to be lost.  This chair is so much better that it doesn't even compare.  Our son has been using it to go to the bathroom (so far just pee pees :) ) for several months and loves it.  In contrast, he is lukewarm about the other chair.The best things about this chair:1)  Simple two piece design means that it is easy to clean.  The bowl lifts out and rinses easily.  Other potties seem to have 5 or more pieces, just asking for places to trap dirt.  Not a good thing with a potty2)  built in urine shield (into the bowl) works great and our son loves sitting on it.  It is a nightly ritual before his bath.3)  inexpensiveDownside?  We haven't found a downside yet."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I started using this potty with my daughter when she was just able to sit up on her own.  The high back was more helpful then, than it is now, but it's still nice to have the high back.  She likes to lean back and throw her arm over the back.  She thinks she's so cool when she sits on her big girl potty.I like the &#34;handle&#34; on the front shield because my daughter hangs onto it and leans slightly forward when using the potty for #2.I like the design of the bowl and how it fits in the potty.  No leaks.  The potty chair my mom has, if my daughter is at a certain angle somehow it leaks onto the floor.  That has never happened with this potty chair.PROS:- High back to help support baby- No-slip bottom keeps potty from sliding on tile floorCONS:- Haven't thought of any yetI bought a second one of these to leave at day care."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great potty.  The biggest issue to me was cleaning.  This chair has no seems or corners to trap things.  The inner liner lifts off and is easy to wipe clean with a disinfectant cloth.  The boy shield is not too high and is rounded nicely so they won't hurt themselves while getting on.  The base is very solid and sturdy and doesn't move at all.  It also looks comfortable with the arm rests.  My son isn't potty trained yet but we purchased it so he could get used to sitting in it.  He seems very happy and will even sit in it to read a book.  Does what it should and doesn't distract from what they are supposed to be doing with alot of toys and noise."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "we got this chair for our son to learn to use the potty. its sturdy and comfortable for him which is great. i like that the bowl is big enough that there is no spraying on the floor and i can actually see when he goes as opposed to him standing up for me to look. its easy for him to get on and off of by himself which is another big plus. i LOVE how easy it is to clean, much easier than the other potty chair we have which is 3 separate pieces.it may not have any fancy extras but it gets the job done!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We owned our last blue babybjorn potty for over 10 years. It survived 4 children.  Unfortunately, it was accidentally cleaned with a substance that ruined the coating.We decided to go with a bjorn again and we are please with this one.  It is a large potty seat so this will fit a large child.  The white part removes easily so that it can be given a quick rinse.A child can lean back and not fall off the potty. The seat is big enough so a child can sit easily without hurting themselves.Overall, I am please with the purchase."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "First time potty training for our 14 months daughter.  Too many choices available on the market, but trusted all the other reviews on Amazon. This no frills potty chair doesnt look like much, but I really think they did a wonderful job designing it.  Easy to clean, and my toddler isnt uncomfortable sitting on it to go potty.  The high back rest helps alot, because she tends to sit far back to get comfortable.  Its very stable and we dont worry about it tipping over.Good value, nice design, and definitely easy to clean.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can't say enough good about this potty chair.  It's inexpensive (but very well made), SUPER easy to clean, has a very comfortable splash guard for boys and is comfortable (I'm assuming).  I originally bought the Safety 1st Potty Chair/stool.  Don't like it at all.  Tough to clean (lots of spaces for urine to get) and I don't think it's very comfortable as my son refused to sit on it.  Within 20 seconds of sitting on the Baby Bjorn he peed.  Refused for weeks to do that with the Safety 1st.  Great product.  Can't say enough good about it.From a parent's stand point, it's the best b/c it's soooo easy to clean.  I'm not clean freak, but this is a huge benefit with anything in the bathroom.Kudos to Baby Bjorn for a simple product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles.  There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed.  $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up.  In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase.  The simple design is easy to clean.  My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over.  The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits.  Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds.  My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes.  So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We love this potty chair (bought one for each bathroom).  The design is simple.  It is comfortable and easy to use.  My 2 year old son has had no problems with it.  Very portable (we keep it in the back of our vehicle for longer trips).  We also have the BabyBjorn potty seat which is great as well.  I like having both so my son can choose whichever he wants (he likes both equally).  Made in the USA too!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to \"keep it all in\" if you know what I mean! =) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore! We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all. This one is truly THE BEST. Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up. It's also a really good size \"bowl\", some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in. AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "LOVE this potty - it's so easy and comfortable for our son to sit on. Picked this one up after starting out with a Fisher Price potty that didn't have a splash guard (stupid me!), which was frustrating for everyone involved (trying to tell/help a 2-year old to \"point it down\"... yeah, right) - as soon as our son tried this one out for the first time, his motivation level skyrocketed and he quickly became excited about peeing in the potty, instead of dreading it. The design and height are perfect, and the seat is easy to remove and empty (so much better than the ones where you have to slide the potty part out to empty it). Best potty ever!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles, flush noises, music, lights, the works.  Then I thought, wait a minute, the regular potty doesn't have those things.  She wants one like mommies! I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read \"the potty book for girls\" She was immediately  sitting on it without any prompting. Once I finally took her pants off she went right away.  We are still working on going always on the potty, but she loves the potty itself.  It is very basic and sturdy.  My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front.  I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the \"big\" potty."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When I began my research for a potty chair for my son, I had no idea how many things there were to consider! I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the  bowl afterward)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38\" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Got this for my daughter (shes 2).  I like it real well.  She is a smaller child and it fits pretty good.  She can sit on it and on feel like she's going to fall in.  I would recommend this to others.  I also got the step stool. She likes to run over to the sink and wash her hands when she's done....The step is nice too.BabyBjorn Safe Step - White(I got the pink one to match her seat)It stays put and is sturdy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair. If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy. The splash guard is way too short, my son just pees right over the top of it. I do like the separate potty and it's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply doesn't hold in the pee stream. Ugh. I'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair. MESSY."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We are taking a soft approach with potty training our 21 month old. He likes his potty chair and can sit on it comfortably, though isn't really using it much yet. Like the chair, purchased 2 of them in different colors, good size for tall 21 month old and easy to clean. I knock off one star only because I can tell the \"splash control\" on front for a boy isn't going to be perfect, but I think that is likely to be a problem with every potty chair out there...and no big deal since I plan to keep the potty in the bathroom only. If we do decide to take it to another room I will absolutely put something under it to protect the floors."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have this potty in green.  I was lucky enough to find it on clearance at a local store by me for $12!!  If I would have known how much I would love this potty, I would have spent the money on it two years prior when we were potty training our first child.  I love the simple design of this potty and that it only has two parts.  It makes cleaning much easier.  No one enjoys cleaning out a potty, but it's so much easier when you only have two pieces to clean.  Our other potty had several pieces with it and a lot of cracks and crevices.  I just wipe this potty up with a lysol or clorax wipe and I'm done!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This thing is the perfect height for the boys (youngest has been sitting on it since he was 18 months, and the oldest is 4.5) to sit comfortably.  It is really easy to clean and there are no crannies for icky bits to get into.  It's pretty unobtrusive color wise, but it is kind of large. There was one incident where my older son pinched his fingers between the &#34;cup&#34; and the base, but he has since learned and we haven't had any more issues.  There is a band of rubber on the base to keep it from sliding around and it does a good job, but it seems to attract all the dust and hair in the bathroom and they stick to it pretty well, so I have to use a wet rag to rub the stuff off it every couple weeks.  Overall, great product and not too pricey."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is my 5th potty chair and so far the best for a boy that I have found.  The pee still splashes out occasionally, but far less than all the other brands.  It makes me so mad that they don't have boy-specific potty's.  The splash guards are always too small and they leak ( like our defective Thomas potty seat)  So I am happy to have this one as a big improvement.  My son is on the large side he is 34 pounds and 36 inches tall and just turned 2 last month. He fits on it just fine and likes that he can lean back."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Everything I read said to keep the potty as basic as possible.You can't get more basic than this potty and the winning factor for me is that it is so easy to clean.There aren't any cracks or crevices you need to worry about.I bought it long before I knew my child was ready to use it and placed it in the bathroom as someplace she can hang out while Mommy was in the potty.  If your child was like mine, she wanted to follow you everywhere, even the bathroom.She started sitting on her potty to emulate me.After a bit, she asked to take her pants off and that's how we started potty learning.Since the basin is one wrap around tub, I just life it off to clean and put it back.  No need to snap things or worry about cleaning crevices.I also like that it is the right size.  The back helped stabilize her when she was really small and now as an older toddler, it still fits her just fine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Easy to clean.The &#34;lip&#34; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty, but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the &#34;bowl&#34; off to pour the contents in the toilet.  Even my 2 (almost 3) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides. Makes it comfortable for the child, especially when we initially began using the potty."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Overall this is a nice little training potty.  Simple design, high back for comfort and easy to clean.  My son seems to like it just fine but I wish it had a taller splash guard.  My son is 20months old, 3+ ft tall and weighs a little over 30lbs.  He fits on this potty just fine but he ALWAYS tinkles over the splash guard so I have to aim his weewee down for him.  I would not let my son use this by himself at this point (we've only just started potty training) because odds are I will end up with tinkle all over the floor."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have just started potty training my 22-month old, and haven't used this chair very much.  It is sturdy and doesn't look like it will slide on the floor or accidentally tip over.  It is a good size for a toddler and comes in lots of great colors. I bought this because I read many lukewarm reviews on the potty chairs that sing and light up and do fancy things like dispense stickers...we wanted something simple and basic, and this fits the bill. My only complaint is that the inner bowl, while very easy and quick to remove and clean, can be a blessing and a curse: when my daughter sits on it for any length of time, it sticks to her skin, and has almost spilled when she stands up too fast.  That is the only thing to watch out for.  Other than that, it is great!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this because of the excellent reviews, so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive.My son is 3'3\" & 30 pounds. (he is almost 3 yr old) He does fit on this potty, but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes. It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said \"oh mommy my legs!\" It's not great to start potty training with a painful experience. He is now afraid of it.I don't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it's because he is too big for the chair, but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now. I wouldn't recommend this potty for larger children."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I just finished potty training my oldest child and really loved this potty chair.  When we first started potty training, it was a little too big for her- so if you have a small child, it might be hard for him/her to easily get on and off of it alone.  By the time she was 2.5, she had no issues getting on and off.  The splash guard is great and makes it easy to lift out while still keeping your hands clean.  The potty part is also deep enough to hold anything in it if your child decides to bring you the potty to show you their work :)Great little potty!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We actually started with the potty inserts that go right on top of the regular toilet (built in type, portable type, and a cushioned type).  My son was refusing to use that to potty train, and we decided to try this one instead.  It took awhile, but now he's using this exclusively.He likes it because it is just his size, doesn't require help from us, and can be put right in front of the tv (we'll have to change this last one soon!).  He will even wait to pee when we are out so he can use his &#34;small potty&#34; at home instead of public toilets.We like it because he uses it, it is easy to clean with the white part coming right out of the chair, and the splash guard is great for the boys.  There's a smaller version of this chair without the back that we take with us when we are out or on vacation too."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I just received my son's potty chair two days ago and he absolutely loves it.  He sat it in it like a chair for an entire day the first day but when he took a pee in the potty chair, it went all over the floor instead of into the bowl.  The downfall of this chair is that, the front piece that's suppose to block the pee from spilling out, is not high enough.  My son is a 2 year old and he's rather tall for his age but height has nothing to do with the front piece.  It's just not made high enough to block the pee from spilling out.  However, it is easy to clean because the bowl just pulls out easily."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wanted a small potty chair that would be easy for our 18 month old to sit on. We didn't pressure her to use it, but would casually ask. She would run in and sit on it, read on it, and sing songs. Fast forward to when she is 22 months and she now asks to go potty and will actually use it for that purpose!  Still in the potty training process, but this is a great starter tool.  I specifically got the white with splash guard so that it was the same color as the adult toilet in all the bathrooms and also so we could see if she went."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a child sized toilet.  It is attractive looking.  We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house.  Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it.  I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse.  My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that.  I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet.  We are big fans of this."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The seat is the perfect size for toddlers, contoured to be comfortable, and designed to be easy to clean.  Your little one will sit and be situated as i the same body position as an adult on a real toilet.  The raised front of the white part serves as both a pommel/hand rest and a splash guard.  The white bowl is deep enough to prevent most splashes.  The back and arms are high enough to make your little one feel secure and allow him/her to rest against them.  The seat does not slide on tile flooring.  When your baby is done, just lift the white bowl and clean.  Perfect potty training chair.  Fits almost anywhere and is very light."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased these in the hopes they would work for our newborn.  Unfortunately, I haven't even given birth yet and I already know they're not going to hold up to the demands of a newborn wetting even once in them.The pros: inexpensive.The cons: These diapers are horribly rough, even after a washing.  The fabric is fraying and even triple folded, these things do not hold liquid.  Since I'd already washed them I figured I could at least use them for dish towels, but they merely move the water around on whatever surface you're trying to dry, they don't absorb.Save your money and skip these...and buy a higher quality cloth diaper."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These for cloth diapering?  Um, no way.  Way too thin for that.  These for burp cloths?  Absolutely!  While I still periodically reach for the pretty and colorful burp cloths that are specifically made for that use, they are not nearly as absorbent as these Gerber cloth diapers.  My child is not even all that prone to throwing up and the other burp cloths are still not enough... I cannot imagine how often you would have to reach for a 2nd, 3rd and 4th burp cloth if you had a baby who spit up all the time.  These are easily washed and inexpensive... admittedly not as pretty, but most mothers get over \"pretty\" real quick when real life sets in and baby becomes messy all of the time! lol"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "A friend recommended I register for these although she knew I was planning to use disposable diapers.  I accidentally registered for the diapers with the absorbent centerfold, and fortunately,  received these.  They are large -  27\"x 27\" square and are essential for baby care.  I still use them every day and my son is almost a year old.  I used them to line his cradle and changing-table when he was first born and going through many diapers a day.  They work great as burp cloths, and are superb for wiping up other food messes.  Additionally, I found they work as a light blanket during the summer months.  Extremely durable, fold-up rather small for travel, and launder well.  101 uses, I love them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I do not use these as diapers, but I couldn't live w/o them.  When my baby was really little, I used them on the changing pad to keep from having to change the changing pad cover constantly.  These are much easier to change and wash than those covers.  These are also the best burp cloths.  My daughter has really bad acid reflux, and not many burp cloths can stand up to a good spit up.  I go through about 5 a day.  They are VERY absorbant!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was very disappointed in this product. It was highly recommended by the hospital, so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born. After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks, I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple. We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those, either. We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium. She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those. Now she's a pro! (Anyone need my Medela set????)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The bottle quality isn't great for the price.  Dr. Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style.  So you can pump and use, just as you would with these bottles. If you use regular bottles, the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in. Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.99 to pour into other brands of bottles.  I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey, when I use up all of those, I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These bottles are useful for storing milk....they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely.  My baby hates them for feeding, however.  I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles.  I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby...and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast.  Um, no.  Take one look at them and it's pretty clear.  My baby wouldn't even take it in her mouth.  She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples, however.  Much, much better!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right?  Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding.  Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now).  I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage.  I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These bottles are great but are very pricey.  I have a 2 month old and I was producing more more milk than he was drinking allowing me to store some in the freezer.  I was hesitant to use the bags because I was afraid they would leak so I found myself wanting to buy more bottles, but for $18.99 for 6, I needed to find another alternative.  I did some research and found bottles made my Mother's Milkmate (mothersmilkmate.com or on ebay) These bottles are compatible with the Madela breast pump and nipple rings.  The refrigerator storage system is great too, you have to check out the website to understand what I mean.  If you love these bottles, you've love the milkmate ones as well.Hope this helps and saves you money!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got the Medela bottles because I intended on breast feeding my child. Unfortunatly I was unable to do that. But these bottles work wonderfully with formula!My daughter retains much less air with the Medela nipples and she seems to prefer the shape as well. I found that when I sterilize Gerber nipples they become \"gummy\" and \"sticky\", but the Medela brand holds up very well in our sterilizer.I think the Medela bottles stand the test of time, which ends up saving you money in the long run and my baby LOVES them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "What I like about these pads are the way the don't slip around at all when you lay them down on carpet or flannel sheets.  My daughter has started resisting being changed on her changing table, so I use these pads to change her on differnt floors in our house.  And awhile back when she had a particularly upset stomach and lots of diaper blow-outs we kept her on top of these pads all day, whether she was sleeping in her crib or anywhere.  They worked wonderfully.  They come clean easily and I don't mind that the cotton pills up.  That helps to keep it from shifting on carpeted floors."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My wife purchased these from another store for more than twice the price so I decided to bring down the cost average after we found out that they do not leak. There is a small rubber piece that fits in the spout to control the speed that the liquid comes out. After your child gets old enough you can eliminate the rubber piece. I think these are great to use as soon as you stop using bottles. After you stop using, the rubber flow control piece you can use them until your child grows out of sippy cups or you lose them. Great choice. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 1 1/2 year old and have had my fare share of sippy cups to use clean sometimes throw many away. I use to think that using the soft sippy cups  was a great transition from bottles..NOT!! these are the best they are easy to clean they dont leak everywhere and they hold the perfect amount of liquid. I have found that children with teeth chew on the soft tip and it is no longer leek proof which makes night time a big pain, anyways these are awsome and i defiantly recommend them. I got the purple and pink one since they very but i didnt mind its not like having a pink sippy cup makes my son gay or anything so people are so silly"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "While I agree these cups don't leak, they are difficult to get clean. The underside of the lid has crevasses around the mouth bit that are deep and narrow and almost impossible to get really clean.  I have been using ours for awhile and regularly sterilizing in boiling water, but the residue build up in the lid has gotten to the point where I have to toss them and buy new sippy cups. Too bad, as they are great in the no-leak department. I will be buying a kleen kanteen sippy--no leaks, stainless steel and easy to clean."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are very convenient if your child is already using the Avent bottles. If you use a Medela pump, you can get an adapter and pump straight into these containers, eliminating a step in the breastmilk collection chain.I also find that the small sizes are convenient, especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out of one or both breasts.I didn't give this product five stars, though, because, really, these are just four more Avent bottles with a sealing disc. If you have a bunch of bottles anyway, you can just buy a pack of sealing discs for about $4 and use those instead."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had previously purchased another tub because it was a few dollars cheaper but soon regretted it once received. The tub had two pouches to but the soap and shampoo. But the one thing i needed was a drain. The dirty water built up and the only way to get it out is to tilt it up so it can pour out. Such a hassle while washing a 9month old. Not with this one though. I can fill the tub up for him to play and splash and allow it to drain out when its time to wash. Great, so my son don't soak in dirty water which he does pee in."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We used this tub for my baby from about 7 or 8 months old until about 13 months.  It was a great transition from our infant bathtub, giving her more space without using all the water that a full bath would require.  It only took moments to inflate by mouth, and I never needed to add more air.  I liked being able to use the tub in the middle of the big tub so my baby was never in close proximity to the faucet or water controls.  The vinyl is a nice quality, and I ended up using it outdoors as a small wading pool at my mother's house after the baby outgrew it for bath purposes.  Once she started walking it was not long that she learned how to climb out of the sides, but I'm very happy with the job that this tub did for the months we were able to use it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My son outgrew his infant tub so I tried to bath him in a regular tub - wasn't having it!  So I needed something fast that could act as a transition tub.  This fit the bill.  I would recommend buying a hand pump to fill it (just be very careful).  I tried to blow it myself and nearly passed out!  I used the pump from my exercise ball and it was inflated and ready to go in minutes.  Just place the plug in the hole and fill!  I am not sure why people have complained about it being slipper - my son stands up just fan when I have to wash his bottom.  He loves it!  My only complaint is that the bottom leaves...um...rear end stains so make sure you keep it clean or at least pre-clean your babies bottom before putting them in.  I always do so I don't know how it stains but it does!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm very satisfied with this affordable blow up tub.  The bottom part under the baby's butt blows up separately than the sides, which is nice because my 6 month old was unstable sitting on the blown up bottom at first.  She loves the ability to play in the water in here, I just have a hard time keeping her sitting in the tub, she keeps wanting to stand up and climb the bathtub walls. I think that's more an issue with my very active daughter than the tub though :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wanted this to use for the baby while I showered, and for him to play in while I dried off. We have a standard sized tub and this took up so much room that I had to step into it to enter or exit the tub. It would be ok for somebody who was sitting next to the tub while baby bathed, as it would save time and water not having to fill the whole tub.I had some problems with mold, and boy is it tough to get off once it's there. I tried scrubbing with vinegar and baking soda, and some bleach. It mostly came off but was still in the cracks. Honestly, we got more use putting this in the back yard during summertime, and now it's getting tossed out."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this inflatable tub for my son because I wanted to have a portable tub for when I went traveling with him. This tub is great, I even use it at home. I started using this tub when my son was 6 months, he is now 9 months old. Now that he sits up on his own, it's a lot easier to bathe him. I like using this tub better than an infant bath seat because I can wash him more thoroughly, all around instead of having his legs fastened in a tub seat. If you travel, it's a great idea to get an inflatable tub, it's portable, and quite sturdy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My little one outgrew her baby tub around 5 months old. I purchased this item and read the previous reviews. Great item...its cushy for baby and quite large for her and her toys :)  Another great thing is even if the suction cup is wet, it still sticks to the bath tub wall without any problems and doesn't deflate easily (it's been about 2 months and still have not had to inflate the tub since I've purchased the item).Only CON is that as a previous reviewer had mentioned, the tub is slippery. So I bought the Green Spouts bathmat to put in the tub so my daughter does not slip and slide everywhere."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a nice enough tub but nothing special enough to warrant five stars.  I like the Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub better than this one because it is deeper and the bottom plug is cushioned better the SnugTub's.  The SnugTub is slightly longer, though, and that was a key issue.  Why doesn't someone invent a larger toddler tub?  We're trying to postpone having to waste a lot of water filling the entire adult bathtub for our growing toddler's baths.  A vinyl tub that is 9 or 10 inches high and 30 inches long would be perfect and sell well.  There must be lots of other parents looking for a similar transitional tub!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The DEX Pillow is great.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am 21 weeks along.  The pillow is not overly big and fits nicely under the belly.  I tried the fully body boppy pillow, but had trouble sleeping with it and I had trouble with having to adjust it again after turning over.  This pillow is easy to change sides with.  Before pregnancy I slept on my belly.  I find that this pillow has really helped me transition from being a belly sleeper to a side sleeper."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It is a small pillow, most useful underneath another pillow to give you a little elevation. It's really too uncomfortable to lay directly on it, maybe if you just wanted to put it between your legs it'd be okay. I don't think I'd call this a \"pregnancy pillow\" - it's too small. My wife needed full upper body elevation and a pillow 1/4 the size of her back (and only 4\" tall) isn't going to help. However this worked good for just head elevation (with another pillow on top)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think we bought this for $8. I was in the market for a snoogie but couldn't bring myself to pay $60 for a pillow I would only use for a few months. I am 7 months along and I didn't realize that I needed to 'lift' my belly a bit. Works great. A lot more sturdy than I thought. I'm glad it's not memory foam because I need a 'lift' not to sink in. I gave it 4 stars only because I have 2-3 more months to go in my pregnancy.A great buy! A great little size that does the job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This pillow is smaller than a standard sized bed pillow.  It is just enough to wedge under my hip & keep me off of my vena cava (now 7 months along.)  It does not solve all of my comfort issues, but it gives me peace of mind that I'm not laying flat while I sleep (which I find myself doing without it.)  It seems like it will fit perfectly in my bassinet after the baby is here to elevate her head.  And when I'm done using it for that, it will make a perfect knee-separator pillow.  I have already gotten my $10 worth & forsee using it for a long time to come."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help.  However, this didn't really help me sleep better at all, if anything it made it worse.  It was very uncomfortable.  Maybe I'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger.***UPDATE***  Now that I am 33 weeks, I use this support pillow every night.  Once my tummy got bigger, the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much.  Now I can't sleep without it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not for car seats.  However, it doesn't have to do with crash testing issues.  The technician who installed my car seat told me to never ATTACH anything to my car seat (including toys) that didn't come with the seat, and the way these headrests fit, that is considered to be attached.  The reason had to do with how your baby will fit in the seat.  It's the same reason you are not supposed to put your baby in a car seat when he or she is extremely bundled up- you end up securing the clothing more than the baby.  The technician did recommend the rolled blanket idea- the blankets will not cause harm to your baby in a crash, and they do not interfere with how the baby fits in the seat at all.I am using mine in the stroller and his swing.  It works well for these items.  I give it three stars because it is not totally useless."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This headrest is perfect.  Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this.  When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward.  Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy.  At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this.  I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible.  It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car.  For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower.  I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest.  Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat.  Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury.  The product may be a fine one, but I found an &quot;extra&quot; one to be unnecessary."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "At first I really liked this. My 9 month old daughter loved munching on fruit with this. But, when I tried to clean it I realized that it was a bit more work than I expected. You can purchase new netting for it but why spend the extra money when you can buy one by Munchkin at Target for less? The Munchkin brand has a levered top so you don't have a bunch of seperate parts to monkey with. Also - not to be weird but on a taste test the Munchkin brand had no taste while this one seemed to have a little, bitter taste. For $3.00 go with the Munchkin one. You will need to not only run it through the dishwasher but also give it a thorough once over. Sometimes little bits if food gets stuck in the netting (but in this one and the munchkin brand). Whichever you decide to go - this is a great invention!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this product a few months ago despite all the bad reviews and so far I have not had a problem with it. My son loves it. I've had this sitting in the sink (dirty) for days sometimes and I have never once had a problem cleaning it. The best way I figured out on cleaning this product is to just clean it with hot water and dish detergent and clean out the inside really good with the same type of brush that you use to clean out the bottles. Even the bananas come out and who cares if its a little stained as long as you know that its clean. I was in the store the other day and saw a similar version of this item made by Munchkin at less than half the price of this one. I wish I found it before because this baby safe feeder is a little outrageous in price for this kind of item. I would still  definately recommend this product though."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think this is a great idea. I only used it a couple times for foods. At that time she was having trouble mastering how to hold the handle and soon after that she was able to pick up foods on her own and was pretty good at chewing. I LOVE this product for when she is teething. I put a couple ice cubes in it and wet it under the faucet so it doesn't stick to her lips. She gets upset when the ice is gone. My daughter is 11 months and has been teething almost none stop since 3 months...Currently she is cutting her first molars and this helps for her to suck on it and get the cold water back farther than a teething ring would."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion.  I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me.  Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them.  If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up.  Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean.  Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump.  I really didn't like using them with the twist ties.  That didn't make sense to me at all.  I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better.  They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup!I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If I had to freeze breastmilk, this was great because I didn't have to put a lot of plastic containers in the freezer (we could use them to feed the baby instead).  They were easy to dispose of if they outdated (there is a place to label them with the date).  I usually put 3 of them in a freezer bag as a double layer of protection against leaks and freezer burn.  None ever leaked for me.  They thaw easier and faster than in hard plastic or glass containers, too.  Very convenient."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These bags leave a lot to be desired.  They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them.  They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer.  The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on.  And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside.  All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this gadget.  I bought two extra bases for my infant car seat for both my husband's and my mother's car.  Unlike my car, there center seat has a harness strap.  Those are hard to get really tight.  My center seat has just the lap belt and it was easy to secure the base.  With the harness strap it was just too hard to get the seat in tight enough.  With the mighty tight, it was a snap.  You just hooked it in, cranked it, and voula!!!That seat isn't going anywhere.  I love it.  It is easy to use, it makes the seat secure, and it is sturdy.  You must have this if you are trying to secure a seat in a position with a shoulder harness."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Something like this is a great idea, but when I called to ask the fire dept. to inspect my car.  They said not to add any after-market things to car seats or seat belts. The firefighter said this could weaken the seat belt over time and it may break in a crash. They also said that the headrest for the infant seat was dangerous because it adds more room between baby and the seat, which may cause the baby to be injury seriously in an accident.I took both out of my car. The mighty tite is just collecting dust.  I have no plans of using it or giving it away.  If I can't find a use for it, I'll probably throw it away.  The headrest is in the bouncer or the swing. They are great for around-the-house everyday use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We own these sheets and they are great specially for my nephew..they seem \"thin\" but actually they are not to thin...i washed them many times from baby puke...these sheets has saved our travel yard from the evil smell of vomit! and i put a light weight blanket under him (on top of the sheet.) when he was a newborn/1month old...these sheets kept our play yard very clean!! and we love them and will buy more when baby #2 comes! we also have the yellow one and this green one..they both get used daily and washed daily (if puke happens) and we love the easy on and easy off!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have a Baby Trend playyard, and these sheets fit perfectly.  I only use the sheets when we're traveling and my son uses the playyard to sleep in, and I haven't had any problem with the sheets coming off during sleep (and he's pretty active at night!).I will agree that these sheets are lint magnets.  Also, they're not the softest sheet in the world, but that does make them a bit more durable.  However, since we just use them at night, I would have liked a bit softer sheet.  The sheet is also quite thin.The best thing is to not have high expectations for this sheet."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I also almost didn't buy these sheets because of the reviews on this site, but I couldn't find another brand either, so I picked up two of these in navy.The sheets are a bit on the thin side (they are the thinnest sheets we own for him), but since our son has been sleeping in the bassinet in our room since day one, they are the only sheets he's ever slept on. They are okay sheets that are holding up very well, even through numerous washings. Oh, and they aren't elasticized, but it is so tricky to get them on the bassinet, I have no worries that they will come up (we haven't used the play yard feature yet).By the way, we've been using them all through a hot Colorado summer; if this were winter I would definitly be looking for something softer and cozier."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet.  Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality??Also, keep in mind your wash loads.  I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels.  Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry.  Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth. My nipples were raw, sore and a little bloody. Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples.  My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture.  To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts. Ouch! I found the smooth, cool lycra of my bras was better. A waste of money!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they've worked great. They're easy to wash and dry, I just throw them in with my regular clothes. I didn't give it 5 stars because you can't wear these with thin clothes or they show. I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way, but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show. I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use. I bought two packs and might get another one so that I don't have to wash them during the week. Why buy disposables? Seems pretty wasteful to me."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was hoping to find a more eco way of dealing with leakage than using disposables. These work in terms of absorption for me (I should qualify that to mean I leak but generally during feedings or at night and not profusely, but enough to soak 50% of the surface of my bra at a time).Unfortunately, they are so thick they show through my more tailored clothes (flowy, patterned tops seem to remedy much of this problem). The stitching is rough and itchy. Once the pad is washed it's very ripply and won't sit flat (which is the biggest annoyance for me). They're great if you plan on being a slovenly hermit at home, but I wouldn't want to wear them in public."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This nursing stool drastically improved the usefulness of my old-fashioned rocking chair as a place to nurse my newborn. Prior to the stool my lap was slanted in a way that made it difficult to position baby and my back was leaned too far back to be useful. The stool converted my lap into a flat horizontal stretch that could support my baby and improved my posture so I didn't end my sessions with a backache. However, I also found it useful while nursing on the couch or other armchairs (same benefits) and my husband loves to use it when he is getting baby dressed after a bath as it helps him keep his lap horizontal as well. An added bonus is that it is incredibly easy to put together (5-10 minutes tops) and comes with it's own allen wrench tool."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been having horrible back problems since the third trimester of my pregnancy. And things got worse when my son was born. I simply could not get comfortable while breastfeeding, and was having trouble maintaining good posture, so my back was getting worse and worse. I ordered this stool thinking it would help me get comfortable and sit straight. Unfortunately, it has not helped me at all.I think one main problem is that I am very short: 5'1\" and change. When I sit on my couch, my feet don't reach the stool. So it doesn't help me there. While I sit on the miniature recliner in my baby's room, my feet do reach, but the sticky pads on the feet of the stool are not sticky enough. So if I put any weight on the stool at all, it slides away from me in seconds.This is a nice product, and well made. I just wish it worked for me. :("}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I didn't think a stool could really make it more comfortable to nurse, but I was wrong!  I used this with an old rocking chair and found that my legs were much more comfortable when propped up - especially during those long nights of rocking!  The stool is well-built and comes ready to use in the box.  The natural wood color is attractive and goes with nearly any decor (just so happens that my crib and baby armoire are also natural wood color).  I imagine this would be a great stool to use if you were nursing on a chair or couch that was stationary as well."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Once you have this stool, you will use it long after you stop nursing. It is wonderful for just propping your feet up while reading, watching TV, doing needlework, and much more. I have a rocker/glider that I use in my front room and the gliding ottoman is just awkward and bulky. I was using a regular child's step stool but have had to tip it onto two legs and I'm starting to notice some wear on my carpet. It is also easier to pick up and move out of the way than the ottomans or switch to the couch."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for this stool when pregnant, thinking it would be a nice position-helper while breast feeding, and it is, with one drawback: it tips easily if you put any weight on the edges (top edge or either side). So far, this hasn't been a huge problem, except for making a loud THUMP every time I do it, which sometimes startles the baby. I would just suggest that you avoid ever using it as an actual stool and never step or stand on it, and keep any little kiddos away from it too.Other than the potentially dangerous tipping thing, it is a nice wood piece and went together very easily. As stated before, I would not use it in place of a safer flat stool, but it would be absolutely great under a desk to prop up your feet while working."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are great if you have an infant who learned to stand up in their crib and decided it was time to sharpen their new teeth on the rails (which I think almost every infant is!). in other words these are a must. I have only 1 problem with these (hnce 4 stars). no mater how you try to group them, they do not cover the entire rail on any side of my baby's crib (standard size). At least 2 inches on each side are still left bare for her to chew on. The company should change their length in order to be able to provide complete coverage at elast for standard crib sizes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I liked this product because it's a good rubbery material to chew on, but it only fit on the sides of our crib as the front bar is much wider. I had actually gotten these & put them on when my daughter was in the crib, but after being on a few months, they almost looked kind of liquidy underneath and when I went to remove them, they removed some of the wood varnish as well, so I left them on to look better. My daughter actually never did bite on the crib railings but my son does (3yrs later) and prefers chewing on the front bar best, of course. At least the side bars they fit on will not be used when it's converted to a full size bed, but there will still be those teeth marks on the bed footer. Oh well, it's kind of cute. I plan to use one of those wood color markers to cover the teeth marks if it really bothers me."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I like the idea but in reality didn't work for us.  We would have had to order 3 sets to cover the 4 sides of his crib which gets pricey. The length (from top to bottom) is not enough for his crib either - his rails are more like 2 or 3 inches.  So he can get his bottom chompers underneath these and still go to town on the wood. And of course he pulls them off easily and throws them to the floor too (11 months).  I'm going to order some cloth ones that can be safely tied on-not interested in a DIY project when it comes to ties and cribs."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We are fortunate in the design of our computer desk.  A baby safety gate did the trick for us. Instead of installing a power strip safety cover, I purchased an inexpensive tension safety gate (ten bucks) and pushed it way back under the desk against the wall with all the cords and boxes (routers etc.) behind it.  Keeps his little hands out of everything and I still have room for my chair & feet.  Still trying to find the best solution for protection for 2 other strips in our home. Seems like nothing is perfect."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These have worked very well for us.  We have power strips of a couple different sizes in our house, and this fits over all of them.  It is large enough to cover all the bulky plugs we have plugged into the strips as well.  I was surprised to read another reviewer found this too small.  I think the cover should work for most single-wide power strips; it probably wouldn't work for a powerstrip with two rows of outlets.  I found it relatively easy to open and close.  I don't think my baby daughter will be able to open them herself, and she won't be able to reach her fingers in and shock herself.  I now own at least five of these."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is one of the worst products created for child safety. It didn't fit our standard power cord, the front section opened really easily (actually had a hard time getting it to stay closed) and once we opened the back section to plug things in, couldn't get the back section closed again. Also, the opening at the top is huge! Definitely big enough for my 9-month old to stick her fingers in, which is kind of the opposite of its purpose. I sent it back and moved around furniture to hide our power cords instead."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got this for the power strip in our livingroom by our tv.  It does a great job of hiding the strip and the plugs and I like that you can open the part of the on/off switch separate from the section where the plugs are.  But there also lies the problem with this.  The clips on the side are not easy to reattach.  So as long as you don't plan on opening and closing this a lot then it works great.... but if you need a cover over a strip that you need to access a lot, then this one will most likely frustrate you quickly!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It's not flimsy to me at all.  Maybe because the carpeting in our apartment stabalizes it, but it's perfect.  I also think it's very pretty - it brightened up the room.  I just love it.  Makes me want to further decorate the room for the baby.  Perfect height for me as well and plenty of storage room.  I do wish the pad furnished was a bit thicker and softer but it's sufficient.  I like how it's covered in smooth vinyl so we can clean it very easily.  Great table for a great price!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have four of these covers- one blue, two green, and a yellow.  They definitely make the changing pad a more comfortable surface for our baby- he loves just hanging out on them.  We leave a lap pad on the cover which is the first line of defense against accidents during changes.  This somewhat reduces the frequency of cover washings.  Some people have noted that they find these covers unnecessary- I'm sure the changing pad would be adequate by itself, but I just feel like the whole area is cleaner when I can throw the cover and pad into the laundry.Be advised that all our covers did shrink slightly after washing.  They do, however, continue to fit well on the pad.  The colors also faded slightly with washings."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it.  The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric.  The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel.  I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though.  Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad.  You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one.  I never used covers with DD and never had a problem."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have some Dr. B brand bottles. They are awesome. But when I was a first time mom, I hated washing bottles and parts. It didn't take much time, but still it took time. So I switched to Playtex Drop-Ins bottles. Yay! I rinsed tons of nipples and washed them all at once later on the day. Now I have my 2nd child. Playtex Drop-ins is the only one I use.The liners are expendable. It designed for the bottle. It's durable and doesn't have plastic smell like other generic brand I used once.Please note: If you want to use generic brand liners, you fill water to the water lines ON THE LINER instead of the marks on the bottle itself. The water level/volumn is different."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have twins so when purchasing products, it was all about investing money in things that would make our lives simpler.  These Drop-Ins work really well for the bottles. The bag collapses as they consume the contents, which supposedly improves problems with gas but I'm not sure this system accomplishes it better than any others. Because the bag is thin, it also takes a lot less time to warm bottles if that is a consideration. The real savings is the manpower and time necessary for cleaning. I only have 4 bottles per baby, replace the liner and nipple when necessary, and wash everything once a day.  These don't come cheap so I don't think there is any cost savings associated with this versus buying a boat load of bottles."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Couldn't find this in stores around my area. But I've used this before and they're great. It's convenient and it minimizes the need for a lot of bottles and best part is they're disposables. I never had problems with this drop-in liners before although I did read another review that there's another liner that can be used with the drop-in nurser bottles, just as good if not more effective, cheaper and more count. Regardless, this has my stamp of approval and I would recommend this for new parents."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've been using these and absolutely love them! So much easier to clean than other bottle systems. Can easily remove all air to improve gassiness and colic in little one. Just press in the liner from the bottom. We are currently supplementing with formula and only using 2oz per feeding in a 4 oz liner, and it is still easy to remove the air.With the ring and nipple loosely on the bottle we carefully press on the liner from the bottom until the liquid level nears the top of the liner. Then we tighten the lid and continue to press any remaining air out through the hole in the nipple (be careful when pushing up on the liner before tightening the lid as liquid can easily overflow). If your fingers are not long enough, we sometimes use the handles of some of our kitchen serving utensils to aid in removing the air."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We chose to use the Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins system because of convenience and sanitation. I'm so glad we did! We've been using the 4 ounce liners for 4.5 months now and we have never had one leak or break. They're very easy to use and reduce my time doing dishes. I've used the 8-10 ounce liners a few times as well with no issues. For those curious about measurements, it's very close to the measurement on the Medela bottles I pump into and Nuk bags. Sometimes after pouring milk into the liners they will expand just a tad more once the weight of the milk pushes the crinkles out, but it's not a large amount at all. I've used the 4 oz Up and Up Target brand liners as well, but when these are on sale at Babies R Us they are usually cheaper than buying the generic from Target."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love the drop in system bc although you have to buy liners, it's easy, sanitary and really helps reduce air intake. My only issue is when I put the liner in and use the bottle to measure- it's slightly off so I have to pull the liner out and check the (example) 6oz mark and I am using the bottles that are made for expandable liners so something is off and I like to be as precise as possible... It's  not that big a deal but I wish the bottle lines and liner matched perfectly."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When used with the slow flow nipple and the breast pump adapter kit this is the closest to breastfeeding as you can get.I bought the breast pump adapter kit and now i pump in these bags and never have to use a bottle holder at all.no more milk transfer from bottle to bottle, and no more air at all.  you can squeeze all the air out of these liners.take a look at the images to see step by step how i connect this to my pump kit and using the adapter rings and caps store, and feed without the need for the nurser bottle to mimic as close to mommy breastfeeding as possible.  For medical reasons my baby could not latch and this allowed me to bond with my daughter and have gas free feedings and be literally as close to breast as possible.  Check out the images - you will see for yourself this amazing way to nurse your baby."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been using those for months and will keep using them. They are convenient because it is easy to prep a per-sterilized bottle without having to worry about cleaning bottles. I usually rotate with 4 nipples so I always have at least one clean to put on the bottle and it is ready.The bags don't seem to collapse as the milk is drunk. This might be more an issue with the bottle itself than the drop-in.First few times I wasn't careful in positioning the drop in and ending up pouring the most of the milk on baby due to a bad leak. After doing that twice I was more careful in positioning the drop-in.Conclusion it is a great idea, time saver on cleaning."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used these with my first daughter 8 years ago. They are wonderful! You do not have to sit and wash bottles constantly. The baby will also have less gas since there is little to no air to contend with. The only difference with these are that they are expandable. This may make a difference for some using formula in respect to measuring differently with the expansion. I will be using them to store breast milk for when I go from breast to bottle as baby gets older so the expansion won't affect me any. I recommend these liners for everyone."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Playtex system works well with my Medela breast pump - you will need to buy these liners, plus a set ofPlaytex Drop-Ins System Breast Milk Storage KitPlaytex storage rings (which these liners drop into). That kit comes with an adapter that fits on a Medela pump. The whole system is convenient and easy to move from frozen storage to feeding simply by dropping these liners into a bottle, and you can buy either latex or silicone tips for your bottles. The thin plastic allows the milk to heat up easily by submerging in warm water before feeding. Overall, very convenient and in almost 7 months of pumping, I never had a leak! Also, BPA free which is great!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love these and will be buying more.  I like that is made of tissue paper and nothing plastic.  They absorb pretty well--I admit that when my son decides to pee in the middle of a diaper change the sheet does get wet very fast, but 95% of the time it doesn't leak into my changing pad sheet. I usually throw away the wet peewee pad right away so it doesn't have time to leak anyway. These really are a lifesaver and save me from excess washing of the changing pad cover. I only wish that Amazon sold the 108 ct instead of just the 36 ct pack."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This warmer costs more than it's worth.  We have to stand there while it's &quot;warming&quot; a bottle until the light turns off and then when we check the bottle it's still cold.  Having to stand hawk eyed over a bottle warmer with a crying, hungry baby isn't fun...especially when it doesn't warm the first time around.  On the other hand, if the bottle stays in a minute too long, the milk gets so hot that we have to set it in cold water.  There has to be something better out there!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I received this as a gift and was surprised at how quickly this warms bottles.  However, if you don't pay attention, it will overheat the bottle.  It would really be helpful if there was a timer or auto shut-off because the water can become scalding.  I usually use the wide-neck bottles so I don't have the \"floating\" problem but the few times I did use the slim regular bottles and did experience the floating bottle.  The upside is that it does accommodate the wide neck bottles.  It's also an easy-to-clean item."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've had this warmer for 3.5 years, and have used it for both of my boys. It still works, after 3.5 years, as well as it did when I bought it. The only thing I don't like is that you have to add water almost everytime you use it, and that it doesn't have automatic shut-off. I have burnt much milk and formula in my life! (When you're chasing two kids, it's easy to forget you're cooking a bottle!) And, there have been times, too, that I've forgotten to unplug it for hours at a time... my fault, I know, but another reason auto-shut-off would be great."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My sister-in-law told us not to register for this because she couldn't get it to work.  Well, I wanted it and I registered for it anyway.  We got it and I decided to give it a try just to make sure it worked.  I used it the next time my friend came over with her newborn and it worked great.  Just add a little water, throw in the bottle, and in minutes it was perfect.  My only suggestions would be to add an on/off switch and a timer.  But other than that, it's another great product by Avent."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was told that you can warm up water in the microwave or just put it in a bowl full of hot boiling water. But, in the middle of the night after weeks of bad sleep, the last thing you want to do is exactly that!! With the avent express bottle warmer is the easiest way to warm up your bottles with less trouble. The only thing that I dont like of this product is that doesnt have an on/off switch. Otherwise, its great!!! ( avent products are the best out there...)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We started off sterilizing using the old-fashioned, boiling water in a pot...what a mess and waste of time! Standing over the boiling pot and risking steam burns ran out of fun very quickly. After I got over the sticker shock for the sterilizer and got it home, I couldn't see how we survived before! It's quick, easy and efficient. New moms have enough to mess with, don't spend you few, precious moments each day waiting for a pot of water to boil, splurge on this item and you won't regret it!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This sterilizer is GREAT!  My girlfriend boiled her bottles and I can't believe how much easier (and safer) this is!  This only takes minutes and no risk of steam burns!I also sterilized the Avent breast pump and all of its parts in this sterilizer.  It worked great!Another plus:  the two racks with the tiny holes (not the one that the bottles rest on) can be snapped together to form a \"basket\" if you wanted to throw stuff into your dishwasher.  I've never done that...I'd rather sterilize the bottles and nipples and stuff using the steam from the water and not use detergents from a dishwasher...my baby's not even a month old yet...maybe after he's older, I'll use that feature as well.  For now, this sterilizer is EXCELLENT!  Definitely worth the money!  We're very pleased with it.  We also have the Avent food warmer...another great buy!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have a dishwasher and had a full term very healthy child, and still used this product. Lids and nipples tend to turn up in the dishwasher and retain water, and sediment..so what is point if I have to just rewash them?This sterilizer holds 6 bottles, nipples, tops, and pacifiers all at the same time. You can put breast pump parts in it, and anything else that you need to sterilize. I washed everything, filled this with the items and water, and popped it in at 6 minutes in our microwave to have perfectly clean and sterilized bottles, pacifiers, or breast pump parts. I used this everyday until my son was 6 months old, when we stopped sterilizing bottles. Its easy, safe, convenient, and fast."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this a few months ago and after reading a little about it, I thought that I wouldn't use it.  Boy, was I wrong.  I use it for all sorts of things.My niece dropped a sippy cup of juice in my car that wasn't discovered for a week.  I washed the cup.  When I removed the valve...NASTY.  I don't think it's ever been taken apart and washed.  After a second washing, I put all of the parts in this and let the microwave work it's magic.I love the lift out tray because whatever's in there that I'm sterilizing isn't sitting in the water.  It can also hold the Avent Isis breast pump.  The sterilizer is actually a great place to store your pump when it's just been cleaned and not in use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ama clean freak and ws parnoid from day one about germs and my first child. I live in an area with hard water and boiling things was not reassuring because the water left deposits on our nonstick cookware. I would wash her bottles and things , pop them in here and in the time it took me to finish cleaning the kitchen or toss some clothes in the dryer this would be done. I could leave the bottles in there or take them out and prepare for use while sterilizing pacifiers and other items. I use the Avent system and love this!Now that she is about 7 months I only sterilize once a week but this s so simple I do not regret my choice. Being a nurse I worried about my daughter catching something....this was just reassuring.Great as a gift...."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am one of those without a dishwasher, unfortunately.  I use this sterilizer a few times a day for my baby's bottles and parts.  I don't use Avent bottles - works fine with other bottles.  I have to agree about making sure it's shut/snapped properly.  You have to make sure it's just right before you snap -- otherwise, you will break a nail or two.  Also exercise caution when taking it out of the microwave.  I always use an oven mitt to take it out and when opening the lid to avoid steam burns."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It doesn't get any easier than this product.  Boy, am I glad that I got this at my shower.  I have never used anything more in my entire life than I have this guy.  It sterilizes my Avent breast pump as well.  As an aside, don't just rely on your dishwasher to sterilize your bottles and your breast pump.  For some reason, I never felt comfortable anyway just depending on it and put the bottles from the dishwasher into this sterilizer.  Well, I found out later that it was a great thing I was doing that because our dishwasher was not heating the water the way it was supposed to and nothing had been sterilized!  You can't always depend on one thing to do the job and since it's your baby's health involved here, take the extra step and make sure with this item.  I'm glad I did!  Plus, it's just so very easy to use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is such a great item and I can't say enough good things about it!  I use it several times a day for pacifiers, baby bottles, and breast pump bottles.  It couldn't be easier than popping things in the microwave for 5 minutes and knowing that your baby is getting sterilized items.A word of advice- be careful about removing it from the microwave.  The water inside and the steam can scald if you are not cautious.  Let it sit for a few minutes before opening, because the water can splash when opening the lid."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The express steam sterilizer is really the easiest and most efficient way to go if you want to be assured that your baby's bottles are truly clean.  When I first started using bottles I would use the sterilizer between dishwasher uses.  But after repeated cleanings in the dishwasher, the ounce markings on the bottles started to fade away, and the plastic caps to cover the nipples started to change color.  From then on I've used the sterilizer exclusively. It is quick, easy and effective.  I have taken several extended trips with the baby, and it is so easy to travel with and store her clean bottles in. This is one of those products that may not be necessary to have, but I am so glad that I do!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This has been a lifesaver!!! It can sterilize 5 small bottles & nipples 5 minutes at a time!!! Just add the correct amount of water, pop it in the microwave, and go!!! It's saved me so much time and hassle... At first, I didn't think that I wanted to spend the money on a sterilizer when I thought I could boil them myself for free, but this has more than paid for itself in it's first 3 weeks of use... A definate must have for new moms!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We initially bought this sterilizer for use with our first child born in 2005. I loved it then, but I'm even more impressed with some updated details in the version we just bought for our second child. Before, putting on and removing the lid used to be a bit awkward. Now, easy-to-use latches have made doing both completely hassle-free. The inner steam tray also has more slots and spots that make arranging items easier. The older version was very similar but did not have specialized \"compartments\" to such an extent. All in all, it remains an extremely easy product to use because if I had to sit there sterilizing by boiling water and whatnot, it surely would not get done. That the sterilizer comes with bottles is pure bonus. I'd buy the steamer alone."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "What more can you ask for? This is one of those baby products! It's VERY easy to use: so easy to use, you will learn to use it (believe me, this is important) &quot;in your sleep&quot;. It is inexpensive too: just shop around for other sterilizers and you will see this is the best one you can get for this price. Finally, and perhaps most important of all: this is an essential piece of baby gear. Sure, you can boil those bottles and those pacifiers, but let's face it: this is the 21st Century, and you might as well make use of your microwave."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I highly recommend this product whether you are breast or bottle feeding (or sippie cup for that matter). I did not originally register for this item because I didn't think it was necessary, especially since we have a dishwasher. This is a great tool to get all those baby/toddler items germ free. I mainly use mine for sterilizing my breast pump supplies, bottles, and pacifiers. 4 minutes in the microwave and its done. Its not necessary to sterilize all baby products but when something really needs to be, it sure beats having to run the dishwasher. There are just the 3 of us so we only need to run the dishwasher about twice a week. I find that I sterilize more often just because it is so easy to use this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Yet another great product from Avent!  This is so very easy to use and in minutes you have sterilized bottles, pacifiers, toys, pretty much anything that you can fit into the the thing.  We have a dishwasher, but our doctor advised that newborns can be sensitive to the soap the first few months.  Plus with animals in the house, we just like the idea of a little extra peace of mind.  By the way, we started with the electric sterilizer but after reading the directions and seeing it's size we returned it for this one.  This one is easier to store and use and is faster."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My almost 4 month old son is VERY small (24th percentile!) so the doctor recomended me buying a sterelizer, in other cases careful scrubing and just putting the bottles in the dishwasher would do, and it can save you some trouble. but for those people who need or really want a sterelizer, this ones great. Its much less expensive than the other sterelizers that take over all your counter space! It cleans my bottles very well, and I use mostly avent by the way. It can also sterelize my 2 1/2 year olds \"magic cups\" after he gets over a virus or if he had milk (another product by avent). It is fairly simple to use and much less stressful than boiling water, in my opinion. It also comes with 4 bottles, although my house is a bottle factory as it is! This sterelizer can also be used as a drying rack if needed. I love this sterelizer and it has kept my small son very healthy, happy and playful!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have to pump milk for my daughter at my office, and getting my pump parts clean was challenging.  Our sink doesn't put out enough got water for me to feel that my parts were really clean and safe.  Now, I wash the parts and then put them through a steam sterilization in the office microwave, and I pump with the confidence that I'm not adding harmful bacteria to my breastmilk.  It also serves as a nice place to store my pump parts at the office, where I know they will remain clean and untouched."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "On more than one occassion I've had a crying hungry baby on my hands in teh middle of the night or the very early morning, and walked into the kitchen only to find that all of the bottles are in teh sink or in the dishwasher yet to be run.  It's much easier to keep my daughter distracted four the 4 or 5 minutes I need to wash and sterelize in this product than to wait for a load of dishes to run!  If this sounds like somthing that could happen to you . . . buy this product! (Or put it on your registry)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I saw this and just had to get it. It's good to wash and sterilize all bottles and breast pump parts before using them the first time.I own the Avent Isis breastpump and this has grooves for it to click into-very cool! I like to sterilize my pump once or twice a week, and once a week I sterilize the bottles and nipples.I can't ever wait for the washer to run, so instead of waiting, I just throw everything I want sterilized into the microwave for 4 minutes and it's done. It's so easy and simple.And it keeps things sterile for 3 hours unless you pop open the top right away!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "For weeks I boiled my ISIS pump parts and bottles, leaving on my non-stick pot calcium stain. As I was going back to work and my baby had to be bottle fed (thus more things to be sterilized), I found this great product and eagerly bought it. It's such a great invention! Everything (pump parts, nipples, dome caps, bottles etc) has slot of its own on the rack so they won't shift around. And if you keep the lid closed after sterilizing, contents stay sterilized for a day!Be sure to check your microwave power though, since it takes 4 minutes for a 1100watts microwave, longer for less powerful ones. Even though I have a 1350watts one, I do it for 4 minutes just to be sure!  And let it cool for recommended length of time to avoid scorching yourself.Enjoy this product and you won't regret."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was using a basket to hold wipes, lotions, etc and keeping on the changing table.  My daughter is growing and is very long so the basket was in the way.  I looked everywhere for a hanging basket but couldn't find one I liked for a decent price.  This diaper  depot is absolutely perfect.  It hangs perfectly on my changing table.  I did put a piece of fabric under it so the finish doesn't get scratched on the changing table.  I love having everything right there at changing/dressing time without taking up drawer space."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We received the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot for ease of access to diapers. It attaches perfectly to the Gulliver Changing Table we have from IKEA which made me really happy. Accessing newborn diapers is a bit difficult since the diapers are much smaller than those used for older babies but that's fine since we won't be using newborn diapers for long. I'm curious to see how it will work with the cloth diaper inserts since we're planning on cloth diapering when our baby is out of the newborn stage. We haven't received our cloth diapers so I have yet to see. I'll post an update when I get them.I do wish it had a little larger storage for diapering supplies. With the wipers warmer in the caddy, it's difficult to see the supplies on the back side and I can only hold a pump bottle of hand sanitizer or a couple of tubes of diaper cream. Other than that, it's a handy product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have recently started having a problem with my 12 month old kicking everything off of the end of his changing table while I am changing his diaper. His changing table is a dresser than came with a wooden surround that is removable once you are out of the diaper changing stage. This easily slid onto the rail and remedied the problem we had with him kicking the diaper changing supplies to the floor.I like that the little side compartments are removable. DIsposable diapers are so thin now that the slot you pull the diapers out through could be a bit thinner. I do often have two diapers come out instead of one. Even with that issue, this product is well worth the eleven bucks I paid for it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have had this product for 2 years now and it works great! We hang it off the side of the changing table and it keeps everything handy. The plastic is thick and it is very well constructed. The only issue we have with it was keeping the box of wipes from moving about in the space for the wipes. We just use the plastic flip top box the wipes come in and it isn't a wipe warmer so it is smaller. We couldn't take a wipe out of the dispenser using one hand without either lifting the lid off the box or lifting the enitre box. To solve the problem, we just bought industrial strengh velcro and attached it to the bottom of the box and the \"lid\" of the diaper depot. Great product after this minor adjustment!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My son is huge and long for his age.  At 8 months he was way too long for the changing pad and his feet were kicking off the products and wipes at his feet.I ordered this product and it got everything off the changing table so he fits now with leg room to kick away without hitting anything.  Wipes are right there and we put a kleenex box in the diaper dispenser (the diaper dispenser isn't great--I'm not sure how it works w/o you grabbing more than one at a time.  We put the diapers on the shelf right under the table and put products and stuff in the lion heart thing.A MUST HAVE!!  I love this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I borrowed this item from a friend when I had my first child.  I loved it!  It stores a stack of diapers, a case of wipes, diaper cream, lotion, etc.- all within reach.  What I liked best was when friends and family came over to help out with the baby, they could clearly see where everything was to change baby's diaper.  Also, the plastic is clear, unlike a fabric diaper stacker, so you can clearly so how many diapers you have handy.Loved this item, will probably buy it for myself now that I'm pregnant once again!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This model is such a space saver for my small changing table. It's very strong and easy to hook on the sides of the table (make sure that the edge of your changing table is not too wide though and be aware when you want to put  any wipe warmer on the top tray. Most of them don't fit inside the tray. It just fits regular wipe boxes.  And the side containers also don't fit very large bottle of baby powder or lotion). I still highly recommend it though."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic, it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses, I guess it's meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I'm giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the  product itself  is wonderful, it's not cakey, gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections, therefore I highly recommend it :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have mixed feelings about this product. When I first started using it, I can see and feel the difference. It actually started to literally peel the dark skin away. There's a bit of a sting but that's how I know it was working. My skin was lighter in just a couple weeks! However, once I've stopped using it when I reached my desired skin color, it went back to being dark. I applied more and suddenly it was no longer working. It didn't peel or sting. I wonder what went wrong or if it has an expiration date or something. Overall, it works but definitely not consistent."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I haven't been a big fan of Prada's fragrances over the years but absolutely fell in love with the sweetness and candy-like scent of this perfume! This smells like a sweet, decadent caramel with tones of vanilla and I'm not sure what else, but it smells great! Although, I must say that this seller is asking for WAY too high a price for this bottle! You could get the 2.7 oz bottle for around the same price at Neiman Marcus (the 1.7 oz for around $80 if you prefer a smaller bottle)!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "We were pretty disappointed with this shampoo and conditioner. Had high hopes for it, and it did not deliver.The smell was okay.It was harsh and stripping on the hair follicles.Left our hair with that squeaky clean feeling, but not in a good way, more in a removed all the oil from your hair kinda away.Even in using the conditioner, my hair still looked frizzy. And I do not have frizzy hair! Mine is fine, thin, and straight. If anything I usually border on having my hair be too silky and need things to volumize it.Just cannot recommend this product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "So i have been using the Avalon Organics both Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now. I have seen a pretty good result. My hair has definitely gotten a bit thicker and stronger. I notice less hair falling out. I have combined this shampoo/conditioner with also taking Biotin Supplements so i do not know if its solely because of the shampoo/conditioner or a combination between the both, but improvement is there. My only one complain is that the conditioner doesnt give you that soft conditioner feel other conditioners give you.. Its a little rough as oppose to soft. In conclusion, if you have thin hair i recommend both products as well to supplement with a daily Biotin vitamin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have this in our guest bathroom shower and it is perfect.  The bottles hold only about 2/3 of the full size one I have in our master bath, but that is fine since the occasional use it gets doesn't facilitate a lot of refilling.  I loath those wire shelving units for showers so I was so excited to find this and have everything off the floor and kept together for easy use in such a tidy little package.This comes with the silicone adhesive AND a few squares of adhesive foam backing, the idea is you spread the silicone on and the adhesive foam squares hold it in place while it dries.  You have to wait 24 hours before filling the bottles to allow the silicone glue to cure. I have one of these in my master bath for 3 years without budging so it is a very strong hold."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this creme for about 20 years now. It's amazing stuff. It's gotten my hands and forearms (and feet sometimes) through 84 rose bushes, countless tree prunings, landscape rehabbing, etc. I have found that even with cuts and scratches, this lotion never stings. All the herbs probably have an antiseptic effect on injuries, but who knows.The scent is wonderful too, at least I think so. Quite unique and natural, but not overpowering.Since the creme is very concentrated, I DO recommend letting it soak in well before you go driving or touching door knobs, etc. A little goes a LONG way! :0So glad they keep making this great product!PJ"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I first purchased this hand treatment from a garden center - what a favorite it has become. I really does help restore your hands after digging in the garden (or washing dishes in the sink, if you're old-fashioned like me). I have purchased many as gifts for others. This size (100g) is a generous tube and will last a long time. I gave it four stars only because it is more expensive here than at the Crabtree & Evelyn outlet store - or maybe I just got lucky when I visited that store last time. Truth is, I'll buy it wherever I can find it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Best hand cream I've ever used, and I NEVER use hand cream. This year, I got a puppy and with it comes a lot of mess and handwashing. Top if off with my working in the food industry + new York winters and you've got dry, painful hands. I tried many MANY different creams at a drug store one day - 2 hours worth of searching from the least to most expensive creams lead me to this one. It has a light leather smell, so definitely good for men also (I like the smell of leather, so Im a big fan, even as a lady). I put it on after Ive washed my hands and it is thick, rich, and I enjoy massaging it into my knuckles. Once it's on, it doenst leave a sticky or greasy film, just lovely moisture and no dryess. I have a mini tube in my handbag, large pump at the office, an 1in my home. I like the stuff to say the least!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Crabtree & Evelyn Gardener's Hand Therapy has been my favorite lotion for many years.  While I don't have a problem with very dry skin, I still like a good, non-greasy lotion for my hands, arms, feet, and sometimes even my face.  This product is not greasy.  It does not have an annoying fragrance, actually not much at all.  My sister-in-law told me she uses it on her psoriasis and it helps.  It's not a cure, of course.  There really isn't one.  But it helps the skin feel better.  Since she liked it so much, I tried it and have been using it ever since.  It's hard to find in stores---almost impossible---but Amazon.com carries it.  Thanks again, Amazon."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't curl my hair every day so I didn't need to get a high-end curler.  I dropped my old curling iron (10+ years old) and had to buy one from an all-night pharmacy.  I paid twice as much as the Amazon price but was very happy with the curling iron.  What a surprise to save 50% thru Amazon for the exact same product.  Now I have one tucked into my overnight bag for visits to the grandkids.The iron does everything I need it to do.  Heats quickly, evenly, and has an automatic turn-off.  The barrel is the perfect width (you'd be surprised how much this can vary.)  It feels great in my hand without being cumbersome."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The iron heats up quickly and seems to be good quality.  The buttons are well built, easy to understand and use.Like any curling iron, it does take quite a while to cool down, which is frustrating, but true with any product like this one.The cord is probably about 6 feet, which is a nice length to work with.  The cord is a little stiff, so it has curled a little too much now that it has been stretched a lot.Overall good product for the price."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "True to its name, this curling iron heats up fast (literally 1-2 minutes), and a blinking light turns solid when it's at temperature and ready to use. It gets extremely hot -- settings range from 1 to 25 and even a \"5\" is too hot to touch; I've used it at \"13\" for several months now with great results. Its clamp holds hair securely but doesn't snag hairs in the hinge. A sturdy wire foot and a plastic tip keep the hot barrel off the countertop. It has an on/off button and will automatically turn itself off (but not until it's left untouched for about an hour). The iron cools in the usual amount of time (touchable in 5-10 minutes, completely cool in 15+ minutes).I mostly use the 3/4-inch model -- but, with my very short hair, I also use the1/2-inch modelduring the first week or so after I've had a haircut. Highly recommended -- they're the best curling irons I've ever used."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My hair is super straight and thin. It also doesn't take heat very well. What's so great about this curler is the adjustable heat settings. 7 works great for me and I just hold it there for ten seconds. Not only that but the curls actually stay. Most times, they go wavy after the first 30 minutes, no matter how long I hold it on for. But with this it lasted me two hours. I'm so impressed and especially for the price. You cannot beat that."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I absolutely love this conair instant heat curling iron!  I ordered it on amazon because of the great price. It did not come in the packaging I'm used to seeing in stores but figured it may have just changed since my last curling iron purchase (last year).  The first time I used it it worked great.  The second it kept turning off or shorting out on me.  I changed outlets and still the problem continued.I would recommend this curling iron to a friend but perhaps not through the internet.I re-ordered thinking it was just a defective one and the second time, it wouldn't even heat up enough to hold a curl.  I think Conair has changed it's product and I will not buy again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I needed a 1/2 inch curling iron and this one works just fine for my needs.  I have one of the same model in the one inch and I liked it, so ordered the same model in the smaller size.  I like that it turns itself off after a certain period of time because I often forget to do so.  I also like that you can adjust the heat or strength of curl.  I have had many Conair products over the years and have been satisfied with all of them."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I wanted to be blown away by this concealer, but sadly I wasn't; don't get me wrong this concealer is good, I gave it 3 stars because first and foremost it's real sticky creamy consistency, after I applied it, it kept this wet sticky texture, I like the ones that don't stay wet like and sticky, plus it made me have a few pimples,  if your looking for a concealer that stays kinda damp then you will love this one, because all of us girls like different things, and one thing may work perfect for one of us may not work at all for someone else, ya know!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "this is my second time getting this i use it on my problem areas before i put on my foundation then i put on a different concealer afterwards, very close to my skin tone it is a bit to dark but once i blend it it looks fine. if you have dry skin this will accentuate that area. i used this when i had no primer and when i did have primer. i would say use primer, it will go on smoother and be easier to blend, with out it it did kind of look chalky. if you leave this in the heat it will break! happened to me with both of mine because my bathroom heater is on 24/7."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have had one tube of this for a couple of years now and JUST ran out. I am feeling very yucky without it.I only gave it 4 stars because the consistency could be a SMIDGE more creamy, but it has decent staying power.For those who say that it doesn't cover the dark circles under the eyes, you will need to 1st use a concealer that is a shade lighter than your face's skin color first (or closer to a salmon color) and then lightly add this to the top. Watch some videos on YouTube about 'highlighting' and you will find that this color is perfect for those highlighting areas on top of your base/ foundation and normal concealer.Maybe there are better versions of this in the 'fancier' brands, but I am returning to buy this one because I know it works and takes off 10 years when used under my eyes."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm no expert at beauty, so this is just one regular user's experience. However, I put it on and it stayed green, which had me worried. I blended it, and could see the blemish (red) peeking through, while the green remained stubbornly green. Given that it's a stick of concealer, it's a little insulting to think I did it wrong. Nevertheless, I removed it and tried again. Same result.So I went ahead and did my usual powder foundation/settling veil powder routine, and lo and behold - I could still see the blemish AND the green through my makeup.I'm not really sure what's going on. Perhaps I'm using the wrong color concealer? Either way, it really didn't behave or perform the way I expected or hoped it would. Good thing it was cheap because it has been sitting, unused in a drawer since day 1."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very fair, translucent skin and have always had issues with dark circles under my eyes.  I've used every concealer out there, but most only further exaggerate the dark circles and worsen the appearance of bags.  The good thing about this concealer is that it's extremely affordable and the yellow really does help neutralize the appearance of blue and purple veins under the eyes.  The bad news is that it appears cakey when applied under powdered mineral makeup, giving a chalk-like appearance.  This occurs even when the concealer is applied VERY lightly.  If you use a liquid makeup, this will probably not be an issue.  With other forms of makeup, it might not blend as well as you would like.  I still find it does a better job than the other concealers, so I still use a small amount of this and take some considerable time blending it with my foundation."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Im a WOC and I always wanted a yellow concealer for my under eye circles and I read the reviews and bought this one. The concealer by itself is really good quality, creamy texture, long stay,, good coverage plus in a convenient stick so u can just point n put. But honestly I gave it a number of tries and it just looked too pale on me, as in, less yellow more cream-white so it would show through even after blending and blending with my colour foundation. DOES NOT look good on me at all. I guess I'll have to find a proper yellow one in my country local brands, which cater to our skin colours. But that said, its a good product. I still use it for spot concealing."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Oily, and makes makeup slip off without having to apply pressure on the cotton pad. A little goes a long way. Cuts through heavy duty mascara, liner, shadow, you name it (I've used it on stubborn lip stains). You will have to wipe/clean the oil off your lids and lashes if you want to reapply makeup after using this. If you DO need to reapply after using remover, you should consider a water-based makeup remover that will evaporate so you don't have to worry about oil residue causing your makeup to slip off. Usually I remove my makeup at the end of the day before bathing and don't reapply makeup until the next day, so the oil doesn't bother me. Will repurchase."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If you are looking for a makeup remover that removes waterproof mascara this works great. It is oily so you only need a tiny amount on a cotton ball or pad. After wiping off all the mascara I recommend that you wash your face and areas around your eyes with a liquid soap you'd use to clean your face normally. Then splash a lot of water around your eyes especially so there is no oily residue left. If you don't do this the oil can be slightly irritating and may make your eyes feel itchy. So make sure to remove the remover and you should have less problems.~The Rebecca Review"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This was the first waterproof liquid eyeliner that I used. When I first started using it, I loved it. However, I had nothing to compare it to. Since, I've used different drug store brands of liquid eyeliner and this one sort of fails in comparison. Don't get me wrong, it isn't horrible, but there are others out there that are better. It is waterproof, but it isn't air proof. It dries, cracks an then flakes off throughout the day. As it dries, it feels as if it tightens and shrinks (which causes the cracking). While it does this, IT ITCHES SOMETHING FIERCE! After a while, the brush starts to get weird and application gets messy. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Simply put, there is nothing on this earth that removes rough skin for my feet.  My skin is baby smooth after use.  This product is rather messy; therefore I would suggest using the product outside.  Otherwise you are left with white skin bits on your floors that are rather unappealing and difficult to clean.  You will be astonished by how much new skin is revealed after using this product.  I also use it on my hands, knees and elbows.  My skin is highly sensitive and there are no adverse reactions to this product. I've been using this for over 10 years and wouldn't use anything else."}

Buying the largest size on Amazon let's you fill smaller bottles at home if you are self conscious others seeing it, or just leave the big bottle in your shower caddy. I've been using T-Gel for 30 years and I wear black shirts all the time. Every time I drift off to some sort of natural shampoo or expensive quality shampoo.....flakes come back and I go back to T-Gel!"}

I havent had any problems since I started using it. I use it 1-2 times a week now. I forgot to mention that it stinks... It does consist of coal tar so you can expect to smell like tar. I will use this and then a fragrant shampoo after to try to lessen the smell.I also have color treated hair and it has not caused any problems with that."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm on accutane which has caused me to get some dandruff (I normally never have it). After freaking out and doing research, I bought this. It seems to have lessened the severity of my dandruff after just one use, but the smell is SO AWFUL! It's like I dipped my head into a freakin tank of gas! I have long hair and to try to get that smell off is  impossible. I have to put really potent anti-frizz serum in it, then spray some of my strong perfume DIRECTLY on my hair in order to TRY to mask up the smell. Even then it still stinks.If you like the smell of tar and gas, this is for you. If not, try to get the \"clean scent\". I haven't tried it, so I don't know if it's realyl different. Honestly, I'm thinking I'd rather have dandruff than stinky hair."}

This product isn't even marketed towards hair loss but I gave it a try...and it actually works!  I started with the extra strength shampoo but switched to regular (less stinky, still effective).  My hair loss stopped completely and even started growing back!  The shampoo does smell awful, but it works!  I just rinse really well and use a lot of shampoo.  It leaves my hair soft, clean, and shiny.  I will definitely keep using this product!"}

After months and months of trying to find a solution I decided to give this a try even though I thought it was quite expensive and yes, it did start to get better right away. However, it wasn't as quick of a process as I wanted it to be so I decided to buy Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength and use it combined with this and this combination REALLY solved it in a matter of days. Since I've done that I haven't had any problems, my scalp is super clear and I couldn't be any more please. I never really stopped using this product and I don't plan on doing it but just keep in mind that this product by itself didn't really do too much. In terms of the smell I don't really like it, but it's nothing intolerable or disgusting."}

Yay!There's also no smell! I've tried head and shoulders, tar shampoo and hated the smell.This stuff is fragrance free. I love it :)Btw, haven't tried the conditioner but I use my ACV/Water spray as a conditioner after this shampoo. Works wonders, super soft curly hair with clean scalp :)"}

I found it at a local store more expensive than online, so I purchased it here.Wow o wow is my hair happy. My hair has a shine that wasn't there before, my hair seems stronger with the weekly use of the VO5 hot oil treatment and I'm having less issues with our humidity creating flyaways. My hair is noticeably softer to the touch, and easier to manage when I straighten. I'm no longer having to use the flat iron as long.Love love love this product.

I usually do ALL my shopping at Amazon.com because I am a prime member and the products work out to be cheaper than me going 20 miles one-way to the nearest store and then paying sales tax. However, this is the first product that is overpriced on Amazon. Walmat has this product for $13.  So I will buy there instead of here. My review should be that if you suffer from constipation, then this is a great working fiber that is almost taste free."}

One leg I shaved dry and one I used this stuff.This stuff works great, I had a much closer, smoother shave than without it. But, it made me smell like an old man. It has a very potent 'classic aftershave' smell that is just not my cup of tea, as a lady who doesn't want to smell like a great uncle, or for someone I would consider getting close enough to to smell their face.Now I understand why it says 'rinse after using'. That being said, it's still a great product, and I'd buy it again."}

I've never been a huge fan of electric razors, because I haven't found any brand that gives me as good a shave as I get from even a cheap blade. Its been my personal experience that most electric shavers leave lots of stuble and it's hard to get a clean shave under the chin and throat area. For me, it usually requires more time to get a clean shave with an electric razor than is required when using a disposable razor. Williams Lectric Shave allows me to get a smoother shave when using an electric, but its smell, while not offensive, is almost overpowering.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The regular version of these Pufs is way too rough, can't imagine using them on anything but elbows and heels. This extra gentle version is better for facial skin, exfoliates nicely. I use it with Neutrogena Facial Bar, rinse it well, and air dry it on end on a soap tray between uses. It does begin to pill slightly after a couple  months but lasts a good long time as long as you carefully rinse it and prop it up to dry out. This is the most cost effective exfoliating treatment available. Too bad its only available online."}

For the first few uses, I suggest using a very light hand, as it can be a little harsh."}

I couldn't believe the difference!  Still as powerful in cleaning but not as harshly abrasive.  I get compliments on my skin all the time.

They last very well and I usually use one pad for about 6 months or so if I only use them on my face.  Also use them on my arms and legs before the use of artificial tanning products to exfoliate my skin, they are awesome for that!

I have a problem with acne, and haven't noticed any improvement on it because of this product, but it definitely doesn't make it worse and really makes me feel fresh after I've used it.This is now my favorite nighttime cleanser because it's gentle, yet does an amazing job of getting my face clean and makeup-free at the end of the day.

I finally had figured out what worked for my skin and had a semi clear face with a pimple or two here and there (that time of the month, stress) but I needed just a bit more of moisture so I decided to try this moisturizer--BIG mistake. I usually brake out on my chin/jaw and in between my eyebrows/forehead so when I woke up the next day I had so many little white in those exact spots. I cannot tell you how upset I was and how itchy my face was.

I washed my face like normal twice a day and covered the pimple with this. After a day, it was gone! It wasn't red and puffy anymore, and with a little make-up was nonexistant!I don't think you should slather this all over you face though, it does really dry out your skin and leaves it feeling kind of stiff and like you have dry soap on it... but overall, I think it's great!"}

When I turned 25 I imagined my skin would clear up, but it never did.  Then came 30, 33, 36...and the acne was still there, not as bad, certainly, but still an issue.  Then I found this, and my life changed!  This product WORKS...and I won't be without it.  As I said, the only thing that could make it better is if I had it with me the week before the PROM!If your teenager suffers from acne, they just don't need to.

{"label": 4, "raw": "As someone who has battled acne in the past and still gets occasional breakouts, I learned over time that the beauty companies will keep coming out with their new facial cleaners that are supposed to do some new thing that all the other previous facial cleansers didn't do. The cleansers that were advertised as for acne always made my acne worse, especially if they had salicylic acid. This is a basic facial cleanser that does everything you need. Personally I don't want to wash my face every single day with a cleanser full of chemicals. The 6 ounce bar of this is a great value and lasts a long time. The only thing to be careful about with this bar is that it can be a little drying. Make sure you don't use too much, and I always use a moisturizer. I use once a day before bed."}

I see fewer lines and my face is soft and much smoother.  For the price, it is a bargain that lasts far longer than expensive products of a similar nature.  I have found a product in Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme, Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant that I will purchase again and again."}

It does burn/sting when you first put it on, I have sensitive skin and definitely felt the prickles the first time I have used this - nothing intense or painful, but you should be aware.Value - I have found a very small amount of this cream goes  a LONG way, which is nice. A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it's great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time. One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am 45 and this stuff works.  I have used a lot of different products since my teens.  I have NEVER been disappointed with Alpha products.  Simply they work.  Alpha product lines tend to fly low in an already over stimulated market of commercials and new product wonders that appear in constantly in an ever changing money making industry devoted to our own vanity (present company included).  But these products work!  I can testify to that.  The best thing is they are high in concentrate and low in price that is an A+++ in my book."}

I wanted a product with AHAs and think the company's name is deceiving on such a product.  I thought they only sold products with AHAs.  Perhaps they aren't doing this intentionally, but it is confusing and I wanted to let everyone know in case you were fooled too."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this instead of the moisturizer by mistake, and thought I'd give it a try.It works better than most other cleansers I've tried for my more mature, slightly acne prone, sensitive skin. It's gentle, but effective and my skin feels really smooth and great after I use it. I've noticed that it seems to make the Alpha Hydrox Moisturizer more effective. Definitely a plus. The size of the container is ample, and I use about a quarter's worth for my whole face and decolletage, so it will go a long way."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel with good success for the last year.  I decided to try Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash based on good reviews (see beautypedia dot com) and a sale price.The first time I washed I used way too much and took awhile to wash it all off.  After that I switched to pea-sized squirts and it foams up and cleans great.  My skin is dry to normal and I haven't had any of the problems reported by the low reviews.I'll continue to alternate the three products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I wanted a good face wash that doesn't sting my eyes and leave them bright red with irritation.  I read another reviewers comments that this face wash was non irritating to your eyes & decided to give it a try. It does the job and doesn't irritate my eyes unless I intentionally open them while I'm washing my face. Stupid, I know, but I kind of wanted to see if it would burn? So here's the report: not too much. It did burn but not nearly as much as some others I've tried AND it washed out instantly & didn't leave my eyes scarlet with irritation.My personal favorite face wash is by Philosophy - but that's a huge bottle and really pricey. This is a great size, doesn't take up too much real estate on my bathroom counter & does the job.  I'll definitely order again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this to help get rid of the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and legs. The lotion did not help smooth out the little bumps and I found something better instead. Since I still had the whole bottle, I decided to use this as my night time moisturizer. I'm in my 20's so I have minimal wrinkles so I can't attest to how well it helps with those. My skin does feel tighter after using this though. Sometimes I use another moisturizer alongside this one because it can be drying. I wouldn't use it by itself if your skin is on the dry side. My skin has been smoother since I've been using this moisturizer and I haven't had a breakout in a while. I'm not 100% behind this product, but I think it is doing what it is supposed to for my face."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't think my skin is overly sensitive or anything but this product caused my neck to start burning and itching, I had to wash the product off of my neck immediately.It also caused my face to break out, I gave it a few tries to see if my skin just needed to get used to it but my skin was not happy.For me this was a waste of money. It also has this chemical smell that even my fiance noticed after I put it on.I would not recommend this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had done a lot of reading on treating cellulite and stretch marks and found a recommendation to try glycolic acid and AHA. I did a search on Amazon and stumbled upon the Alpha Hydrox which had some good reviews so I decided to give it a try.I've been using it for about a week now, twice a day and I am actually seeing a reduction in the appearance of cellulite! I've been using on my hips/thighs/booty in conjunction with zone-specific exercises (which in the past by itself hasn't produced results like these). I was never overweight or large, so there was never a lot of cellulite, but enough to make me self-conscious in a swimsuit.I would say that the appearance of stretch marks is still the same, but for the price of the bottle this is definitely worth it for combating cellulite!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm ordering this for the 3rd time. I've used it for about a year and it really helps. I'm 56, a natural redhead, with deep wrinkles and age spots on my face. It has softend the depth of a lot of my wrinkles, and faded my darkest age spots.They're not gone completely, but definitely less noticeable. My skin tone is much more even. I use it morning and night. My skin is very sensitive and every other AHA lotion I've used has caused breakouts. I get none with this stuff. My skin is very dry however and after letting this absorb for 5-10 minutes, I use Cetaphil moisturizer... cream at night and the lighter Cetaphil lotion in the morning. Very happy with this product, which is 1/2 the price of drug store stuff and 1/4 the price of department store stuff with all it's fancy advertising."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Let me start my \"story\" by saying I\"m a black woman, age 47 and have always had great skin. . most people think I\"m 35. So I decided to \"invest\" in my skin now that I\"m getting older by trying a product that helps preserve your youthful looks.  I read all the reviews on this before I ordered it as I do with most things I order from Amazon, and was overall impressed.  So, when this arrived I couldn't wait to try it to see if I noticed any difference.  Within a week I did but not before my skin had it's little reaction to it.  Yes it stung, yes I had a few little bumps pop up, couple red blotches, . .perhaps it was some \"junk\" working its way out -- because after that my skin looked more even, more radiant, little lines were less noticeable. . I really like this and will be sticking with it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I received this last night and washed first with a mild soap then a Glytone Body wash with a loofah.  After, I applied this and when I woke up this morning, I noticed a change in my skin already.  *I have KP (Keratosis Pilaris) on my back and small areas of my thighs* Don't expect a miracle overnight, but expect to notice a change in the way your skin feels instantly.  You don't need to apply much of this product.  A small, less than a dime sized amount, is more than enough to work with.  On the box it says that if application does not dry within a minute or less, you've used too much.  It's true.  I think this is a steal for the price and the thickness of this product.  I look forward to more results after a week, two weeks, a month, etc. and will be back for a second review.  7/24/13"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If you want to live your life like a vampire...this is the right product for you! Why? Well, I found out the hard way, Glycolic Acid increases your skins sensitivity to the sun. A warning was issued on the lable, but silly me didn't think it would be that big of a deal. I burnt horribly the next day from 20 min. of sun exposure! YIKES! Not worth it.It does, however, improve the look of the skin, the price is great, and there is no fragrance(YAY). BUT, like most beauty products, it has dimethicone, which is an acne irritant. If you have horrible acne like me, dimethicone is TERRIBLE for you! Find something with out it! If you don't, than this might work nicely for you. Dimethicone is bad no matter what, but it wont hurt your skin appearance if you have no acne."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was really excited to try this because of the wonderful reviews.  I put it on right before going to bed. The 1st through 4th days were wonderful. It did exactly like it promised. My face looked much brighter and clear.  However on day 5, I woke up with red itchy pimples all over my face and neck.  After a series of expensive test and research, my derm said it was contact dermatitis from using this product. She said that it had the preservative Diazolidinyl Urea in it.  She went on say that a lot of companies are moving away from this preservative because it causes problems with a lot of people. Keep in mind, I do not have sensitive skin. That being said, if they would discontinue using DIAZOLIDINYL UREA in their product, I would definately try it again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "As a retired hairdresser I have some training in skin care and the Alpha Hydrox line is effective and modestly priced. It works better than the designer products at triple the price. Don't waste your time or money on any product with less than 8% glycolic acid, and don't be suckered into buying brands that promise more than 14%. The FDA mandates no more than 14%, and those products that claim higher concentrations are \"fudging\" their formulations. One thing to remember? When you try a new product give it 6 weeks of use before deciding whether or not it works for you. It takes 6 weeks for skin cells to go through their \"life\" cycle. It's only after a full cycle that you will see full and true results. I love this whole line of skin care and have been using it for several years. I just turned 50, and people are constantly asking what skin care products I use. You simply cannot beat the Alpha Hydrox line for effectivness and cost!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I recently purchased this from a local store, I have to admit I only bought it because it was reduced price.  But I have be using it twice a day for two weeks and the difference in my skin is very apparent.  I am a black 46 yr. old, since using this my skin glows, my cheeks are naturally rosy, my skin tone is evening out and my pores look better.  And my skin is so soft like a baby's.  I will be definitely be using this for quite some time, and the amount you get 6oz. is quite a lot of product.  In addition to my face and neck, I have be using it on hands and they are smoother and less wrinkled.  I wish I could bath in this stuff.  I would highly recommend it and there was little to no smell from the product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't know what it is about AHA products but they all make me break out insanely. I thought maybe it was just the face wash so I tried the lotion because of all the amazing reviews but it was horrible. First, it doesn't blend well into the skin. Within two days of using it I have acne all over my face, blackheads and huge cysts. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has acne. There are waaayy better products, like Bliss No Zit Sherlock.Edit: I had 2 people say this review was \"unhelpful\" so maybe I should clarify. I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all, I've never had a rash or any type of allergic reaction to a face product before. Maybe this is an allergic reaction, there's a first time for everything! Personally, I just think this product is not good for people who have acne, but it could just be me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "so i've been using this product for around 5+ months. it stung a lot in the beginning and became a little better once I started using it regularly. the cream isn't very moisturizing and to me doesn't have a velvet-ey texture that some of my other moisturizers have.i guess it did seem to work but only after a few months. my skin's texture feels somewhat softer but i'm not sure if it's entirely because of this. in the past couple of months i've improved my diet and also incorporated gym trips.i recently switched my cleansers from the PINK loreal 360 to the apricot scrub also by Loreal 360 and since the scrub dries out my face, i used this and it STUNG SO MUCH. i don't have sensitive skin and i have normal/dry skini have a little product left but i am not repurchasing and i'm switching to st. ivers elastic collagen? cream."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts. The worst part are the red marks that hang around for weeks even after the blemish is gone. This product is not only keeping my skin clearer, thus avoiding more red marks, it's also fading the red marks that were already there. My face hasn't been this clear in a long, long time. I use it once in the morning and once at night. It goes on nice and light under makeup - I can't even tell it's there. I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this product based on the rave reviews about using it as a treatment for acne. I currently have a strict regimen I stick to every morning and every night that is the only thing that works for me. I added the Alpha in and have seen no significant difference. It's on par with using 2% salicylic acid, which doesn't do much. I won't be repurchasing this as I don't feel it's worth the money.My products:Morning- 15% Benzoyl Peroxide face wash, 1% clindamycin lotion (prescription)Afternoon - 1% Clindamycin lotionNight - 10% Benzoyl peroxide creamI tried using this in the morning before applying my clindamycin lotion and then again in the afternoon after washing my make up off. It's better than using nothing but barely."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am using this in tandem (switching nights) with other products that provide chemical exfoliation for my horrible skin, so it is hard for me to speak about its effectiveness specifically. That said, I do know that I have had no problems with this product. I was concerned that it would irritate my skin, as I am certainly prone to irritation and redness,  but I have had no such issues at all. It seems to be the gentlest of the products that I use. My skin is looking (relatively) fantastic lately, and this probably has something to do with it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I didn't expect to like this cream as much as I do.  It's an excellent value and I don't plan to be without it in the future.  Cetaphil now sits on my bathroom vanity and is used as a routine moisturizer for my face, elbows, arms and any other moisturizing needs.The scent is clean and very minimal so it doesn't iterfere or offend.It hasn't caused any breakouts and seems to hold moisture longer than many of the high-end moisturizers I've tried.Excellent product and a terrific value.The glowing reviews here were my reason for trying it and I'm very glad I did."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I buy this sat Costco when it is on sale and went on Amazon to do a comparison price check.  I do not use this as my everyday body cr&egrave;me, even though my dermatologist wishes I would.  This is non scented and I tend to use it at night after showering before I go to bed as it very rich.  I turned on a friend to this as she has very dry skin and now she uses it every day.  Important to note:  scoop a small amount onto your hands and rub your hands together to 'melt it down' before applying to the body."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love this.  My dermatologist has always told me to use cetaphil because I have acne.  I was actually using the cetaphil facial moisturizer for a while until I tried this.  I like it a lot better because it moisturizes my face a lot better than the other.I use it on my face and neck every time I wash my face (morning and night).  It doesn't feel too thick, but it helps moisturize.  It Doesn't feel greasy, oily, or sticky either.  Another plus is that it lasts forever if you use it for mainly your face.  I'm guilty for using in on the dry patches on my arms though!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This stuff is a miracle. I have incredibly dry skin from eczema and allergies. Winter is pretty awful for me. My skin, especially my legs, get very dry and itchy. Then I scratch and they hurt. Then I put lotion on and they sting. And I've tried everything, having particular luck with colloidal oatmeal lotions, but they weren't perfect.But this has been a godsend.Even though I use Cetaphil face wash, I would have never thought to try this out but received it in a package of products from Allure called the Allure Beauty Box. After my first use I was in love.It's thick, feels nice going on, doesn't burn, and kept my skin unbelievably healthy. I haven't scratched my legs once all winter for the first time in 25 years. Seriously unbelievable.I can't recommend this enough. Really does what it says!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I use this as an all over (head to toe) moisturizer year round. In the summers, I put my go-to sunscreen over it and it's not too much. I'm a bit of a product junkie, so in the past I've deviated from this to try other lotions and creams, but always came back to Cetaphil. I'm not budging again. It's economical, it doesn't contribute to breakouts (the skin on my face has an attitude), it moisturizes and keeps my skin that way throughout the day, and it seriously softens everything it touches. It's not greasy, soaks in quickly and well, doesn't interfere with any make up I use (that said, I only use a gel blush and maybe some powder) and it has a good ranking on the Environmental Working Group site (I think a 2 or 3) and contains no parabens. Sold."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Ok, so I'm anal.  I pour over reviews for hours before making a purchase.  It was so well worth the effort in finding the Cetaphil cream!  This cream is light weight, but works wonderfully.  I really don't understand the few reviewers who said this cream was heavy or greasy.  At 52 and still prone to acne from moisturizers, this cream is fabulous!  I purchased a chemical peel that recommended this product for use after treatment and I am so glad I did.  No breakouts, hydrated skin and a steal compared to the other \"miracle\" creams out there.  Also, my hands and legs have never been so smooth and soft.  No more oily/greasy feeling on my hands and legs as with other moisturizers.  Plain and simple, this product works!Thank you Amazon.  Your review system, lightening fast shipping and unlimited selection of products keeps me coming back again and again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a very good moisturizer but it does take a while to sink in and stays kinda greasy so you have to blot. I have been using bp which is drying and this does help but it has no spf and is a little too thick for daytime so I am switching to something formulated for just that. Good moisturizer for nighttime. I def recommend just not for me at the moment. Good luck!EDIT- i now use this around my eyes in the morning because my morning moisturizer has sunscreen in it (the kind you cant apply in that area) and also at night on my upper eye area, i use vitamin e oil as my nighttime under eye serum lol. It keeps it moist and supple! And when my back is dry from using bp. Anyone could use this even for something as simple as hand lotion its good"}

I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn't cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.I'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads).The only downside is that it won't remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This 4 oz side is perfect to throw in your gym bag or overnight suitcase."}

{"label": 4, "raw": "The texture of the cleanser takes some getting used to; it does not spread over the skin like soap so I can't get away with a couple of squirts on a washcloth to wash my whole body. I have dry, sensitive skin and mild adult acne that gets worse with exercise and the hot weather. In the month I used this (only lasted me that long) I realized I wasn't breaking out the way I used to. When I ran out I tried another, less expensive product that was also supposed to be dermatologist recommended. I broke out the next day and had itching in areas that weren't itchy using Cetaphil. I'm going back to Cetaphil but to make it last longer I'm just using it on my face and sensitive areas. I think it's worth it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Hi,I've been using Cetaphil for years now.  I first bought after reading reviews in Allure magazine and I wasn't disappointed one bit!! It's the best, non drying and non-abrasive cleanser I've ever used... and while it is a bit pricey (I'm pretty cheap lol) it's worth it and the bottle (used by my eldest daughter and myself) lasts us 6 months!  And you can use it without water if you needed too!  It's amazing!Honestly, I will use this stuff forever.  :)LOVE it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a fine skin cream , it reduced pore size, improved my complexion's color and uniformity , didn't irritate it and didn't induce acne. I wear it daily prior going to bed and at afternoon if I am not going out ..definately improved my skin overall.Edit : after using this cream for more than 3 weeks now on daily basis I can say it has no effect on my age spots however, it does improve drastically pore sizes and makes my skin looks smooth and soft. will definately re-order"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I can't find this is ANY stores.  Neutrogena makes something similar in a pump, but I hear that it's pretty harsh on the skin.  I got this due to rave reviews -- and Thank You Amazon for carrying it --- and I absolutely love it.  I wear it almost nightly under my moisturizer.  My skin is smoother and appears fresher in the morning.  It did make my nose peel a little bit, but that's when I take a night off.  I really like this and hopefully can continue to buy this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this product for 3 weeks and have had great results. I have dry, sensitive, blemish prone skin. I'm in my late 20's with severe environmental allergies and mild acne. I cannot use Benzoyl Peroxide as it's too irritating and actually makes my skin swell.  Retinol, AHA and BHA are the only OTC products I can use without breaking out. This product is not hard on my skin and I've noticed my acne clearing since I've started using it. In the morning, I can see my blemishes have healed some compared to the night before. I have also noticed old blemish spots fading significantly.  I also like that it comes in a tube rather than a jar. The antioxidants and other ingredients won't spoil that way. Good for Neutrogena for coming out with this product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Blemish Cleanser several weeks ago from Ulta for $6.95 shipped.  I LOVE this face cleanser.  I use it with theClarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, Whiteand have seen fabulous results (no miracles ... but definitely a clearer, smoother complexion).  I only use this cleanser every 2-3 days.  I alternate it with other Neutrogena cleansers so that I do not overdry my skin (especially as we are approaching winter).  So far, my skin looks much clearer and smoother.  I get those occasional blemishes in the T-zone area and this clears it up.  I have even noticed that my pores and those fine lines are less visible.  It even has a nice smell.  Overall, I'm very happy!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried nearly all of the major anti-aging creams out there. I've tried all the big drugstore brands (olay, Roc, etc), I've tried department store brands (clinique, origins, etc), and I keep coming back to this one every time. I love that it does not have a fragrance (the overpowering scent of perfume is what turned me off from Roc). I love that it's not greasy, but yet it gives me just the right amount of moisture before bed. Most of all, I love that this 30-something girl still gets carded regularly when I buy a bottle of wine at the grocery store. Really, what more can a girl ask for from a wrinkle cream?"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using the night cream from this line for a few months and quite like it -- so I decided to buy the corresponding day SPF 15 cream.Overall, it's a nice product. Moisturizes well, and have good enough SPF. I like the fact that it has retinol and comes in a tin tube (so sun can't decay the retinol). I haven't noticed any improvements in my fine lines or wrinkles, but I'm using it more as a preventative measure (I'm 34 currently).However, I have noticed that the texture of the product is a bit chalky and less nice and soothing as the night version. I attribute this to the SPF, so that's fine. I like this product enough to continue buying it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is an amazing night cream. I wanted to try a mild retinol product to see how it affected my acne prone skin and I am happy to say that there are only two products in the world that do not make me break out after using it and this is one of them. I noticed my skin was much smoother after just the first application and only improved afterwards. No tingling or burning as with other retinol products and I even applied it around my eyes without any negative reactions. There wasn't any significant improvement with the fine wrinkles that I have on my forehead due to sun exposure but it is still a wonderful night cream. Overall, I definitely recommend this product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this product in despair after Neutrogena discontinued Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment. But I found I liked this product better. True I am older and it is time to switch to a more intense moisturizing regime, but this product really worked. I know Neutrogena has put Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment back on the market but I am sticking with this Anti-wrinkle stuff from now on. I highly recommend this to anyone over the age of 25 who has the intelligence to wash their face before bedtime. Use this, it may not get rid of wrinkles but it really does keep your face softer and prevents peeling and helps heal sun damage. I speak from experience. This stuff is not a miracle (most products are not) but it really does a good job and the price is very reasonable."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is my favorite thing on the planet! I have been using this body oil for years and years (15+ years). I use after shower before drying off, then my regular body lotion, makes my skin super soft and leaves a nice scent behind (if you like the smell that is, also comes unscented). I recommend to everyone and I know a lot of women who use it that also love this body oil. It is a little uncomfortable to get out of towels (also leave scent behind on them) but soaking in detergent for a few hours does the trick. Just leaves a silky soft finish on your skin, not on your clothes, great for dry winter skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It does not smell like sesame oil at all, which is good. Not like the smell of food. It actually has a very pleasant smell.  Oil is not too thick.  Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing. Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter.  It helps you to stay a little bit warm.  Helps your skin to keep it from drying.  Not bad to use for massage, but kinda expensive for that purpose."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Having used this fragrance free oil for years, I was saddened to find it had disappeared from my local stores.  Only the scented one is available locally, and after trying it, I vowed never to use it again.  How delighted I was to find my old favorite on Amazon.  It works best if applied to wet skin after bathing, then towel dry gently.  It is a very light oil, and is absorbed quickly. Regular use will restore dry skin to a soft, supple condition. Very highly recommended.  Thank you, Amazon! (And, of course, thank you Neutrogena, for developing the product in the first place!)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This goes on soooooo easily and absorbs quickly into my skin.  There is a very slight shimmer upon application.  NOT greasy at all!!!!  Since this product is fragrance-free, I've also used it in my hair, and it works as well as the Fekkai hair oil I use.  It's thin so it would be hard to overdo it like lotion.  The only thing is that when I'm in a rush, some oil droplets find their way to the floor or my counter.  Easy peasy to clean though."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Neutrogena Body Oil is an added extra....something good especially through this exceptionally brutal winter. However, for me, it doesn't work as well in the shower as I expected it to.  I love Neutrogena products and decided to try this.  It works just OK during the shower.  I even do as instructed...use on damp skin w/o rubbing off. I must say though, I find it works much better when I use it in the bath.  Maybe it's the fact that it has more time to penetrate into the skin.I have sensitive skin &amp; therefore I'm really comfortable w/Neutrogena's light products.  I may have to get something a little stronger for the shower but for my baths...it's good!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have oily skin to the point where I avoided using moisturizer as every one that I tried in the past made by skin even oilier. It was embarrassing! I decided to give this one a try because of what it says it does and because I somehow developed small patches of dry skin on my face that needed to be treated, even though I was still oily. This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My skin feels so smooth after application with no greasy after feel and I am totally shocked to see how well it has kept my makeup in place. I did not have to blot once during the day while at work. It's been 12 hours since I applied it today and my face still looks great. This product really works!!! I am overjoyed that I decided to give it a try and highly recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used to use the Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, but decided to try this since my skin does tend to be oily. The lotion itself is very thin. Instead of my normal one application, with this lotion I need to apply twice, otherwise my face is dry and flaky--once after getting out of the shower, and another time before putting on my make up. The 2 stars is for the fact that my skin does look and feel good using this lotion, but there are plenty others that do just as good a job with just half the amount."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had meant to order the SPF version, which comes out of the pump a white color.  This is a creamy-whitish.  Nothing wrong with that, but I need the SPF coverage and I actually use it to lighten up my light tinted moisturizer...I'm kinda pale, so I will stick with the SPF next time.  That said, I still use this sometimes at night or if I know I will be bumming around the house all day with no fun-in-the-sun.  It is lightweight and, like all Neutrogena products, of high quality."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have 30 years old, white female. Had acne all thru my 20s, it's clearing up the older Im getting but this moisturizer has been a LIFE saver. I have tried so many other products out there, Simple, Clinique, Coconut Oil, Oil of Olay, etc... and nothing worked. They were too greasy, too smelly and caused breakouts or over drying and made my skin feel tight. Read many reviews on this, purchased this at my local Walmart and have been IN LOVE with this ever since. I use before my makeup every morning. 1 pump is plenty- apply to face, let dry (5 mins or so) and then apply makeup. I use a Neutrogena Night cream as a night moisturizer, but this would work fine too! So happy with this. No break outs, leaves my skin feeling wonderful and just enough moisture to NOT be oily! Deff reccommend this as a try! : )"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "im 13 and i love neutrogena products. i bought this from target and it was $10. i have been using it only for a little while but i noticed it made my skin super soft!! and spf in a moisturizer is awesome, and the fact that it is no comedogenic (srry idk how to spell that??) i would totally recommed this, i have sort of oily skin and i think i just need to buy some blotting wipes or something like that, elf ahve some 150 for $3!! but i think that theres nothing that will stop the oil from coming out through the moisturizer or your makeup. if that makes sense. hope this helped :) good luck"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For years I have struggled with dry, acne-prone skin, and all moisturizers I tried caused me to break out, left my face feeling oily, or would wear-off and would need to be re-applied throughout the day. This is the first moisturizer I have tried that works for my sensitive skin without any of those problems.This product dissolves quickly without oily residue and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day (until I wash my face my again).  I use this product twice a day (morning and night) after I wash my face, and I love it!  If you are struggling to find a good facial moisturizer, I would definitely recommend this product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I chose tiis moisturizer because it did not have SPF in it and it was advertised as not to clog the pore on my face.  I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay.  I have always used a moisturizer after shaving, it does a far better job of soothing the skin thanalcohol based products P.S. after about 1/2 of the bottle the pump no longer will pump and you are left with 1/2 bottle that you have to beat out with your hand to get it.... I won't make this mistake again of ordering this... Shame of them..."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This creme is super heavy duty, but tends to disappear as it soaks in.  Great for hands and feet. Being in Arizona, I am always having to apply some kind of creme to my heels and hands to combat dryness. I've run through about a dozen, high-end and low-end, but nothing works quite like the Norwegian Formula. Must be all the glycerin?I wouldn't use it on my face, obviously, but anywhere you have itchy, cracked or super dry skin, go for it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First of all, thank you to all the other reviewers who persuaded me to give the Norwegian Formula Hand Cream a try! I can't remember the last time my hands were this soft... if ever.It took a little less than 7 days of regular use to smooth my rough, winter skin and now my hands are soft all the time and that includes after washing dishes.  There is no scent so the men in the household also did not mind giving it a try. I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from chronically dry, rough hands and probably will never buy another brand of hand cream again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have trouble with hand creams because my hands sweat more than the average person's. As a result, I find this lotion to be somewhat slow absorbing. It almost feels like a thicker version of aquaphor - very rich and emoliant, maybe even a bit greasy. However, I notice that my cuticles are very well moisturized when I use this and the effects last several hours. I suggest using it sparingly. It won't be my holy grail hand cream, but I will definitely use it in conjunction with a more fast absorbing and lighter lotion."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This stuff really does work. The hype is real. I have been using Crabtree & Evelyn's gardner's hand therapy for years and have really liked it, but this stuff just plain works better. The other stuff is good though, if you need an alternative, but it's more expensive and frankly isn't as good.I live in the Pacific Northwest, which typically doesn't have a very dry climate. But we are having a very cold spell right now with no moisture in the air and my skin is drying up something awful. And, this stuff has saved my hands and, believe it or not, my face! I use argan & maracuja oils on my face typically and they do wonders, but this magic potion is taking care of a pesky dry spot on my face as we speak.This stuff is fragrance free too, so any of you sensitive folks will have no problem. And a little goes a long way as it is very concentrated."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm absolutely in love with this hand cream. Since it's winter my hands have been cracking a lot and feeling really dry. If it isn't the weather, it's washing my hands too often, but this cream has completely healed my hands. After one or two uses (overnight) my hands feel and look better! You need only a small amount to get this result too (:It does feel a little tacky after you apply it, but give a minute or two and it'll sink into your skin. It'll be like it's not even there!I totally recommend this product. No doubt in my mind."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My mom started using this product and has been \"addicted\" to it ever since. She uses it when her hands are dry any time of the year. I was a little skeptical of this \"miracle cure\" (as said by my mom), but when I tried it out I must say that I was pretty impressed. My dry skin went from being rough and ,well, dry to smooth and moist (but not too moist . .just enough to feel nice). The only problem I had with this hand cream was that it was very thick and it made my hands very sticky/slippery for quite some time . .a longer time than most lotions/hand creams. . .But, after it dried out some, everything was cool . .."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Neutrogena hand cream is just about the best heavy-duty hand lotion out there.  It isn't nearly as greasy as many of the hand creams on the market.  It is quick and easy to apply because it rubs into your skin fairy quickly, yet its effects are long lasting.  Using this cream a couple of times a day really helps my chapped hands.The only drawback of this product as far as I'm concerned is its packaging.  The old version of this product used to have a flip-top cap which was much easier to use and less messy than the screw-on cap which the new version has."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this hand cream for nearly 20 years and is perfect. I have has issues with my hands cracking and bleeding during the winter months, I worked at a hospital and a nurse told me about trying this and it almost seemed impossible to have hands that could feel so soft and not bleed. I have dry skin to start with then the winters have made them almost impossible to keep them from hurting and this stuff has made them feel almost normal. I gave some to my grandma that had very dry skin like mine and this is all she uses and was so thankful for the product. I would recommend this to anyone who has any issue with dryness on the body. You will thank yourself for giving this a try."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Let me tell you, I'm a veteran at moisturizer and i've been thru it all , divorced break up to make upwith all these products.. lol... this is my dovoted one.. what it says it delivers wit seriously magnificent results.you dont need much, just have a good cleanser.. and use a lil bit rub it gently around your face.. drink plenty of wateruse this day and night.... give it about one month, and watch this baby go to work.. im not Lying I spent hundereds of dollarsand waisted them all... what i realize for best skin products come from not expensive over hyped adds.. but the names thathave great establishment and history like Olay..  and this perticular one complete all day for sensitve skin is the best for sensetive skin so dont deviate from it if u have sensitive skin this is your best chance to control your oil and have even skin tone.."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I will readily admit that the ingredients are not great. That's why I gave 4 out 5 stars. But... It works. I've got dry skin specially because I live in a dry climate. After washing my face, it would be greasy looking in less than an hour. I realized my skin was too dry and it was overcompensating. The area around my eyes has drastically improved and my skin isn't as greasy looking.Since using this product for a few months, it does clog my skin. I now only use it around my eyes, cleaning gently with a washcloth.  I have seen a big difference in keeping the area around my eyes moisterized."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a basic make-up remover.  I forgot how thick it is.  It does a good job at removing my make-up.  You need to wipe it off with a face cloth or wet wipe to remove.  It will not come off with just a water splash.  It leaves my skin soft and dewey.  I would recommend to you if you like the extra removal step.  You wil need to follow with a toner to completely remove the residue from your skin.  Nice scent."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This does have the extra ingredients that some people on here are unhappy about, but it does not sting or burn me whatsoever. It feels very mild and nice on my face. Everybody was raving about the smell, so I was surprised when I opened it and realized that the smell is kind of like a grandmother's perfume. It's not a bad smell at all, though. The cream takes my make-up off nicely, even tough liquid liner. I was really surprised by how small the jar actually is, but after using it I realized that this stuff will last me forever. You only need a very small amount to do the trick. Overall, I'd recommend this to anybody!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I never taken care of my face as I should so I ordered a jar of this to start the process. Turning 30 is boring and hard. so far this has been a really, really great choice!! I have very sensitive skin and I get little to no breakouts and this lotion has been a perfect balance to keep that consistent. I've tried other lotions that claimed to be amazing (I'm looking at you Lush) and have either broken out of the ingredients have dried my skin out drastically.I will buy this again and continue to use it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Thank you Amazon for finding an importer for this makeup.  When Max Factor stopped selling in the US, I was devastated.  I then found it at another place online, but they stopped carrying it too.  I hope this vendor will continue the relationship with Amazon.This makeup is creamy, covers well, and comes in a variety of shades to blend with almost any skin tone.  And it is a lasting makeup.  I get several month's use from each tube.  I also love this makeup, because I no longer have to worry about spills when I travel.  It's not magic, but it will cover those flaws and blemishes, of which I have far too many.  It doesn't cake or look garish.  What else can you say?  It works!It is expensive, since it has to be imported, but it is worth the cost to me to.  I love using it that much."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have two other foundations that I mainly use but this comes a close second to them.  Great coverage.  Stays put.  Easy to use.  What more could you ask for?  Maybe make it easier to find.  I've been so surprised at how many stores have dropped this product. I really love Max Factor and hope it doesn't get discontinued.  That would be a real shame for such a good brand.  Their mascara, 2000 Calories, is one of the best I've used too.  Went looking for it the other day in the store but no luck.  Thank goodness we can still get it here. :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the stuff. And as pointed out by another reviewer, SPF 25 would definitely be a better precaution than 15 but this moisturiser is so good otherwise I can overlook it for now. The main aspect of it that appeals to me is that the product actually stays on the skin and keeps moisturising all day. On a face as dry as mine is that is a rare accomplishment. Other creams bite the dust in a few hours on me.A reliable product that does what it claims to do at an especially good price."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I tried this product while looking for a replacement for the Neutrogena Visibly Firm lotion that has now apparently been discontinued.  I am NOT impressed.  It reeks of \"that sunscreen smell\" and leaves my face feeling greasy for hours.  It does not work well under makeup - the face ends up with a somewhat smeary look, similar to the look you get on a hot day when you've been sweating buckets.  Additionally, it causes a very uncomfortable burning sensation if you get even the tiniest bit in an eye.I now only apply this product on my neck and d&eacute;colletage. While it does seem to work pretty well as a moisturizer, I will not be purchasing any more when the two-pack has been used up.Disappointing."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'd been using the regular Neutrogena bar soap on my face for years, but I just decided to grab this one day while shopping.  I could not be more pleased!  I always thought my skin looked ok, but with this I actually love my skin!  Not to sound vain, but I look in the mirror and just think about how good my skin looks now and I don't even wear coverup!  IMO I think it makes me look younger too, but that could be wishful thinking!  This does not have the consistency of a cleanser, it does seem more like a lotion, but don't let that dissaude you, it is really great on the skin!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've found this cleanser does a great job of removing light to moderate oil/dirt from the skin without overdrying.  It is a cream based cleanser with no abrasives in it, so it's very gentle on the skin as well.I usually rub a little bit on my skin with my hands, then wash it off with water.  This is good for when you just need a light cleansing.  You can put a little on a wash rag, then rub your skin with the rag if you need a more robust cleaning.Overall a great product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "When they say deep clean they mean it.  I have sensitive skin and don't normally use astringent products like this but right after I had my baby I was only getting the chance to wash my face about twice a week.  My normal cleanser (which I typically used every day) wasn't getting my face clean when used so infrequently so I tried this and it was a great find.  I understand why some people felt it was too harsh and I would never use it every day, but if you have oily skin and are only getting the chance to wash every few days this is a great way to go.  One problem was that it did dry out my lips if it ran over my mouth when I rinsed my face, so I spread a little petroleum on them first and that did the trick."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this cleanser for years and I love it.  It does a good job cleaning your skin, while also leaving it soft.A few months ago I switched over to Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser.  In comparing the two products, the Biore does a much better job cleansing your skin.  When I am wearing make-up, the Neutrogena Deep Clean always left a little reside behind.  The Biore, however, never did.But, after using Biore for 3 months, I decided to go back to Neutrogena for daily use.  The Biore was just too drying.  I never had a problem with dry skin with Neutrogena.  So, back to what I used for years before.  I'll still use the Biore for the few times a week that I wear make-up...but, for every other day, I am going to use Neutrogena.My husband also uses this and loves it as well."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Men...if you have large pores that get clogged up this is for you.  I started using this two months ago.  It will keep your pores clean and open.  After just one month I found that the pores on my nose were staying open and actually seemed to be slowly diminishing in size.  I have this as one of my many subscribe and save items... so I know it will be a good price and I know it will arrive with all my other sub/saves on the 1st of every month."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't use this often but when I do it feels great to my skin.  It cleans well, removes oil and dirt.  I like how does not cause that overdrying feeling once it dries.  It also seems to have a cooling aid too so if I happen to clean to harshly I won't tell.  For those who wear makeup from my understanding it's a good at removing it before bedtime.  This does cost a few bucks more than its competition Noxzema -- I don't see a big difference besides you paying for the name.  Nevertheless pretty good facial cleaner."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My wife likes this mascara as it thickens and lengthens without clumping. She has a favorite mascara and this one is as good as it is. She also likes that it is washable and easily removed.She doesn't care for the brush as much as others she has tried but she can live with it. One issue that frustrates her though is that the brush is short and it cannot reach the bottom of the tube and she feels that you cannot use all of the mascara that is available.She rates this at 5 stars and would buy it again. I have posted a photo for your information."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Almay make-up remover towelette like  wipes are much better than these Almay pads.

Boy was that a big mistake.  Stay-away from these pads."}

So i decided to try this after all of the tutorials Ive watched.Long story short, I think this look is okay.....Its definitely looks better with your hair curled, like a light wavy....But thats just my opinion....Its a very nice product, everything you need is right there in the box.You can achieve any look with this.i will say my first time, my hair did turn brassy copper color.But i bought a second box by accident and re did my color, and its a nice honey blonde....."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I rarely see copper colors in the drugstores so I was happy to find this on Amazon. I've been coloring my hair red for years but I have found that the coppery reds are much more flattering. And as I tend to leave the mixture on longer than required as i usually get distracted, this does not leave reddish- purply tones. When I colored my hair today I left in on for an hour and it looks rich and gorgeous. Feria colors don't seem to fade as fast either. Great product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This did lift my medium brown hair to a yellow blonde. Which I toned down with a purple toner and now it is a lovely blonde.I left it in for 40 minutes after applying it to my hair. It took me about 20-25 minutes to complete the application so some areas of my hair had  60 minutes of contact with the product. That hair came out completely blonde. Next time I will leave it on a little longer.Left my hair in great condition in comparison to other brands I have tried."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This color is so bold and edgy, it is fantastically vampy. The color has blue undertones, which I learned after dying it over a few errant bleached blonde strands. This color does fade very quickly, and it should be noted that there is nothing natural looking about this color. L'Oreal Paris Feria has several natural looking shades of black--but this is NOT one of them. This color is simply too shiny and far too stark to be considered \"au natural\". Fortunately for me I was craving something more dramatic and quasi scene-looking. I'd recommend this for anyone desiring an edgy look. For those just wanting to touch up on dark strands--seek another product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Bought this product at walmart for $10...  waste of money!!  I am mosltly platinum and had a few yellow tones and brassy streaks that I wanted toned out..  I've used feria before but just the darker brown colors.  It did tone out the yellow.. not so much the brass though....  the damage is horrid!!  It feels like it did the first day a bleached it from black..  save your money and your hair and go to sally's and get a quality lightening cream."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My hair was already platinum and I was simply trying to get the last of the extremely faint neon-ish banana yellow out, as my toners were not doing the trick and I did not want to bleach again.  I thought for sure this would do it, as it was really only ONE LEVEL to lift and this dye promises seven.  My hair STILL came out with yellow in it.  It's a VERY THICK substance and even with my extremely short and thin hair, I think it may have worked better if I had purchased 3-4...however at that point I may as well go to a salon or just bleach it again, it'd be cheaper and end in better results.  Basically, unless you are already an extreme platinum, this dye will not make your hair the colour on the box.  Furthermore, my dark blonde roots turned out neon orange."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love the L'oreal Feria color line and this is proof why I do. Every color I have used by them has been wonderful! I had Honey Brown hair and wanted a change. I didn't want a black with a blue base tone or a violet base tone, I just wanted black. My hair now is very black, shiny, healthy looking, and vibrant. It is kind of messy with the application (but what hair color process isn't?) I knew what to expect though since I use Feria quite often but someone who is trying it out for the first time might be surprised. My only advice is, use a towel. Fabulous product and the results are what I wanted."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't like spending a lot of money and I don't like going to get my hair done. Over the years I try to save money by buying the cheaper boxes but my hair never turns out the way I want it to. When I use Feria it comes out exactly how I want it each time. I also love that it's pretty much the only box that gives out true highlights. It's amazing. Other plus about Feria is that it comes with a lot of actual product. Meaning if you have long hair you only need to buy one box! In the end it's just better to spend a couple more dollars to make yourself look great. I've never had a problem with any Feria hair colors. I love it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I can't find this dye anywhere, firstly. Secondly. IF you're like me and you have dark, dark, brown hair, maybe you should look elsewhere. I actually came to this shade because I wanted a reddish tent to my hair.Anyway, this stuff actually shimmers, though my hair is no where near copper it is shimmering. I actually had shiny stuff all over my pillow for a week, so, just a heads up. I love the results I got. I closer to a copper chestnut than a sultry copper, but, like I said, copper was never my intention."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Don't bother! What a waste of time. On the side of the box it states what color your hair will turn out based on the color of your hair. My hair is dark brown/ black.  The turnout color would be a bright intense red, exactly what I wanted. What color did my hair come out? Dark brown/ black with a hint of red in the sunlight. Nothing like it states on the side of the box.  I pursed this product over another based on the color chart and spent extra to get it.  Won't ever buy from L'Oreal again!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have used conditioning sprays by dove, loreal (costs $9 a bottle!) and frizz ease. This stuff is by far the best and only $3 a bottle at the store. I haven't gotten my hair cut since FEB and it is now NOV and I dont' have any split ends. I use it on my son too because he gets \"crib head\" or whatever it is called where their hair is all nappy in the back from how they lay on it, even though he is 2. This is the best priced and best working spray. I use sulfate free shampoo, skip the conditioner and just use this. I have naturally curly hair if that makes a difference, it is a tiny bit coarse, it isn't thick or thin. This stuff doesn't weigh my hair down either or make it oily, I still only wash my hair every other day."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "In my quest to find the best products for my hair, I purchased this leave-in on a whim, thinking the spray bottle would add convenience to my overall hair regimen. I was so wrong. This product left my hair extremely dry and difficult to manage. I expected it to work like other leave-ins and provide moisture, but all it did was suck the moisture out and leave behind something resembling a helmet. lol The bottle states that the product contains silk protein, but I think there is more protein than moisturizing ingredients, hence the hard hair. I will not be purchasing this again in the future and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love this leave-in conditioner and it's so hard to find! Glad to get it in an &#34;add-on&#34; deal. I'm a lap swimmer and have colored and highlighted hair but don't like wearing swim caps. Instead, I wet my hair and spritz this into it, so my hair is saturated and the chlorinated water rolls off. At least, I'm hoping that's what happens! My hair stylist suggested I do this and my color seems to last as long as it should."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I ADORE this leave-in conditioner! It smells nice, it works great, and it doesn't leave a nasty feeling residue in my hair! I have very curly hair, and live in a humid climate. This stuff was GREAT for humid days. I use it EVERY day after showering, before I put in any other products, and it helps keep my hair from damage due to styling products. If I use just the conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and less frizzy. It's WONDERFUL stuff, and Amazon has a GREAT price!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo is great for removing build up.  I use it weekly because my dandruff shampoo builds up after a while; my friend uses it daily because the many styling products she uses leave her hair looking dull.The bottle says for \"normal to oily\" hair, but my hair is dry and I've never had an issue with it drying out my scalp.This has to be the best bargain shampoo in the world.  If I didn't suffer from dandruff I would use it only a daily basis."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price.  It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this, I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless.  When I got home, I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product.  I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original, almost-odorless formula."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This shampoo does not smell like strawberry. It smells like Jolly Rancher or Starburst strawberry flavored candy. Perhaps a bit like Marie Callender's frozen strawberry pie.  It is sweet and artificial, but not too strong. Nevertheless, I love it. It takes me back to junior high almost instantly  (when I was 12, I purchased any personal care product based on the way it smelled...bonus points for fruity). It lathers well and removes any conditioner product you might have used the prior day/week/year. If you have dry hair and are looking for conditioning shampoo, look elsewhere. This is a shampoo for stripping your hair of excess product. It is not organic, it is not eco-friendly, and it is not really natural. I use it when I need to clarify my hair (and take a nostalgic return to 9th grade)."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I got this shampoo hoping that it would help my dried out winter hair. Well, it made it worse! I looked like Broomhilda afterwards; it stripped my hair of anything that it had left and I looked as if I'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket wet.

Save your money for a professional brand - they definitely overshot the marketing on these!"}

I have been using it for about a week now and it does not to seem to control the shine any better than all the other face powders I have tried.  I put my makeup on around 7:30 and around 9 am the shine is already coming through on my T-zone.  If I apply it every hour I suppose it would keep the shine down but the whole purpose was something I did not have to keep applying.  Also I got Golden and it is a bit light.  It is a nice feeling powder and I do like the case and the puff unfortunately it does not control the shine like I hoped."}

No itchiness, no irritation, no blurred vision (obvs don't rub it into your eyeballs) and i always rinse it off. its also convenient which is the No.1 thing for me. I love Maybelline so yeah, not bad"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Recommended.I have used this to set my L'oreal True Match liquid makeup for years. I have fairly pale skin, and this is the only powder I've found to match my skin tone. Most powders have a tendency to run pink, and I have decidedly warm undertones, so I was pleasantly pleased to find a powder that won't turn my face orange. I have also used CoverGirl's similar powder foundation, which runs slightly more pink than this (though I'd probably classify it more neutral...), and I have a tendency to buy whichever one's cheaper at the drug store. I do not, however, like the powder puff that comes with this product. It's the thin, flat, cloth-type thing that might work better for some people but cakes the powder over my foundation. Whenever I purchase this powder, I use my own face brush to apply it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Lies lies lies. I shouldn't have believed these positive reviews!!

Oh yes it's waterproof so it gets a one star, thats the only good thing about it....it definitely isn't pretty!!!! And NO IT DOES NOT ADD ANY VOLUME. Wasted my money thank u very much! Sigh. I want my money backkkkkkkkkk!! Grrrrrrrr and I bought this for my wedding!!! D:&lt;I should've gotten l'oreal voluminous waterproof mascara instead......"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I guess the coverage is ok, but I don't like the texture.  It doesn't feel creamy and glide on like I want it to.  It has a dry feel to it during application, but your skin doesn't look dry after you apply it.  As I'm applying it, it dries up too quickly, and then I have to get more from the bottle.  A little does not go a long way and I have to really rub to get it on.  It also looks streaky after I'm done.  It's hard to explain, but I just don't like it.  I prefer cover girl."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this for my mom who loves the color. She wants me to get a couple more because she's wants backups.I tried it several times and I would say the formula is VERY good for a lipstick at this price point. It doesn't last amazingly long and isn't as AMAZING as some of the more expensive lipsticks I own (Estee Lauder, Mac). But the difference in price is HUGE. And if you're okay with several touch ups in the day, it makes a good every day lipstick."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First, other reviewers are correct that what is pictured is not what you'll receive. The shape is different, the handles aren't the same shape, the pads are silicon rather than the rubber we're used to, etc. It threw me for a moment... but then I used the curlers. I have used Revlon lash curlers for as long as I can remember and love them. This actually curls my lashes better than all the ones I've previously owned so I don't care that they aren't what is pictured. I don't know if it's the slightly bent shape, the larger head, the silicone pads, or what, but my lashes are completely curled - nice sweep-up effect - and the curl seems to stay much longer. I highly recommend them."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have tried almost every conditioner on the market and found that most are too rich and weigh my hair down or they don't moisturize enough and left a rat's nest out of my hair.  Of course the superexpensive (Fekkai) ones work great but I get tired of paying that much money all the time. I was very pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked PERFECT. My hair felt conditioned but it was not weighed down and it had some body. This has a very light, pleasant scent. I highly recommend this to anyone just to try and see and at this price its not an investment."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "YUCK!!!Too bad there's no option for zero star reviews, 'cause this soap deserves one.After three uses, I have broken out in one of the nastiest cases of contact dermatitis that I've had in years.  If you're even slightly sensitive, I've avoid this one like the Plague.Two Weeks Later:  I still have remnants of the rash on my extremities.  I fully expect another week to pass before it all goes away.I contacted Kiss My Face customer service.  Here's their response:Thank for taking the time to write and for your feedback.  Sorry that you are less than pleased with this KISS product. I'll definitely pass your feedback on to our product development team. We love hearing from our customers even when it is less than stellar, and we absolutely do take your input into consideration when developing new products or when tweaking our current line of products.

{"label": 4, "raw": "I feel the need to write a review of this product mainly because of all the reviews saying its caustic.First let me say I am a soap maker and run a very successful business making cold process soap. Sometimes I don't get a batch made for myself and I have to buy some,so this was convenient and I bought it even after reading some of the terrible reviews. I have several means of testing soap for caustics I used every single one on this bar before using it on my skin,this soap is in NO way caustic! It's a pretty nice basic soap, a large bar, and came at a good price.When I neglect to have soap made for personal use I will definately purchase this product again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've bought this before at the drugstore and used it until it was gone.  The smell is light, the formula is light; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.Problem is, either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch.  Now, even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face, using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser, I get this weird greasy feeling all over.  Shortly after that is what I call \"the water stage,\" where as if by magic, my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top.  I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel, because it looks like I've worked up a sincere sweat.  I don't know what's wrong with this product, and I'm holding onto it to try in the dry winter months, but I'm not optimistic.  At this point, I would not order it again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is more thin than I thought it would be. I guess I was expecting Pond's thickness, but I didn't want to buy Ponds which is a little greasy for me. Hydra Renewal smells so nice and feels good going on. It doesn't go on oily and soaks into my skin well. I have no problems using it on my face, around my eyes and neck area. I have had no problems applying sunscreen directly after and didn't end up with a greasy mess on my face.  I like the price, too, which is affordable. This product is available at Walmart, as well."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Love the smell and texture of this creme, a very small amount goes a very very long way. The smell is simply clean and makes you feel good, and I am very sensitive towards fragrances in lotions especially on my face.I did try this out under my make up, when i wear my Mac Studio Fix, I prefer to use Mac's prep and prime , as with only the moisturizer it seems to make my make up just a bit uneven, not badly, but i saw a bit of a difference.Might try it under the Prep and Prime as I am not sure if the Prep and Prime will give my dry prone face enough moisture.But i do love using this moisturizer to use with my cinema secrets creme foundation pallet, (must try ladies, and amazing beauty product)Overall I love the creme, will definitely re order, and for my break out sensitive prone skin, no issue either. Definitely recommend"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've only been using the product for a week morning and night and can say that it works for its intended purpose that I got it for. Within two days I saw drastically reduced puffiness and after four the dark circles were diminished enough that I felt okay without makeup to cover my severe dark circles.Granted, they are still there a little, but it has only been a week. All in all, I say it works pretty well considering I didn't really have high expectations at all. I'll wait and see if it holds up over time.I don't have any wrinkles around my eyes yet so I can't speak for that part, but maybe it'll help keep them away."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this for a few months now and this just moisturizes. For reference, I have normal, slightly oily lids. My eye area is incredibly sensitive to retinol. I have really dark circles, mostly due to genetics.Pros:-my skin has not reacted negatively to this product-first ingredient is water, making this a good starter moisturizer for beginners-does not sting or bother my eyes much if I accidentally get some in-affordableCons:-does not get rid of dark circles. There is white shimmer in this gel, which will reflect light making it seem like your dark circles are lighter.-does not get rid/fill in fine lines.-dries tacky. I've varied the amount I put on and there's still a tacky residue through out the day. Might be good for those who use makeup.Although I wouldn't buy this again, I would definitely recommend this product to those just starting out with eye creams. Also, this seems like it will last me a long time. I do use this twice a day."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I know there are some very long reviews about these. Here are my suggestions:1) watch the Youtube video and read other blogs/reviews on how to put them in. I had success my first time using and I think the extra research helped.2) I do feel pressure; it isn't true for me that you don't feel anything. I don't seem to have any extra cramping or discomfort other then feeling pressure in my lower, lower abdominal area though.3) I suggest taking these out in the shower if you can or follow the directions about using a medical glove so you have something to put it in to throw it away.I bought these mainly to use for intimacy during that time of the month and for that purpose these have worked great. I don't use these exclusively and still use tampons/pads as well. My partner has been thrilled with the results."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I saw this and figure I would give them a try. When I finally got to use them I read the directions and scanned the square and watched the video. It took a few tries before I got it in place.( I have a injured back so there's not a whole lot I can do. ) I would stay in place for about three hours and then I would have to push it back in place. I still think it would be better if them did come in different sizes because I do feel it is to big. It might just be me cause I haven't had any kids."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm prone to yeast infections, so I try to avoid tampons, which can be irritating.  I've tried two different brands of menstrual cups, both of which were a challenge to remove!  With Softcup, they're super easy to insert and remove.  And while they're not reusable like menstrual cups, they hold just as much and, frankly, I don't want to bother having to wash one.  The fact that they're disposable make them really convenient.  Once they're in, I can't feel them at all, and they don't press on my urethra like menstrual cups do, so it's no problem to pee with them in.  I've worn these on an off for years and have never had any problems with leaking either."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "waaaaay awesome that you can use during intercourse. the boyfriend doesn't like it so much for his purposes, but other lovers haven't seemed to notice or mind. easy to clean and toss... i feel a bit guilty about the waste, but mother nature can suck it. we gotta deal with this bleeding, she can deal with my polluting. i make up for it in every other way anyway; i don't even use makeup remover wipes! no bleached cotton growing bacteria all day, no changing every 4 hours, no drippy pee string, no dirty silicone cup to boil, no feeling it at all, no fuss at all, really."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had been using the DivaCup for a while and had a lot of success with it, but when I lost it a friend  gave me a pack of the softcups she had used once and didn't like. I thought since I had liked the other brand this would be much the same way... it wasn't I don't know how many times I tried to readjust things and try different angles or higher/lower inside the vaginal walls, I couldn't stop the cup from leaking. It wasn't horrible, but it was enough to ruin a couple of pairs of panties which ensured that I wasn't saving money on this alternative item and that I won't be using the brand again. It was an utter disappointment... I'd say try another brand instead like DivaCup or Lunette, I had good experiences with both."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this cleanser since my late teens. It is one of the best OTC acne medicines available, and slightly cheaper than other drugstore cleansers like Neutrogena. When used twice a day, the Clean and Clear greatly reduces the number of pimples I get. Also, it contains menthol, so it feels pleasantly tingly on skin (but do not get it into your eyes; it burns like the flames of he11!). There are only two drawbacks to this product: 1) It will dry out your skin, so wear a lotion and 2) The active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is a bleaching agent, so it will bleach fabric. I recommend using old wash cloths to wash your face and be very careful not to get it on your clothes."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "it is way to strong for my face, i had use a dime size all over my wet face and then rinse,after i look in the mirror my face was red all over.it went straight in the garbage,but what i do like is clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,it smell really good and leaves my face super soft,so i will continue to use clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,as for the clean and clear continuous control acne cleanser never again will i put that crap on my face."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I will admit -- I do feel this product was helping reduce my acne. However, I developed a really nasty yeast infection about two weeks in (sorry to be gross but want to give an honest review) and I also noticed a weird stinging sensation in my lower abdomen. I did some online searching and noticed some people say they develop gastro issues with this product. I didn't add anything else new to my routine and haven't had a yeast infection in years. May be totally un-related but once I stopped the product, my stomach issues stopped. I think this is a good product, but for me, the side effects were not worth it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It's whatever.Been using the whole month but see no difference, maybe it's just me?Anyways, it shouldn't take more than 2 weeks to clear up your acne and maybe 2 months to completely rid of the scars. The pills didn't do much as far as I can see, but the cream helped a bit. But you have to mix it with moisturizer or you get SO DRY!And don't even think about putting make-up on over it because you'll get cakey as as a burnt biscuit.idk, guess some ppl had success? It's cheap so you have a 50-50 chance of it working, it may be worth a shot. but didn't work for me =/"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "this is one of my all time favorite products. It really evens out your skin tone and makes your skin glow! I use it at night before I go to bed and when I go to apply my makeup in the morning after my shower you can really see how even this stuff has made my skin appear. I'm 34 with no wrinkles and a few fine lines and I guess I had uneven skin tone because this stuff will make your skin looking absolutely amazing! fast absorbent, no smell - great results!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've only recently started incorporating toner into my facial cleansing program, but this is my favorite that I've tried so far. This toner leaves my face feeling very clean, yet soft (not tight or itchy), plus it has the benefits of an Alpha and Beta hydroxy. It really does help keep my pores cleaner, and therefore smaller over time. I find it to be perfect for my combination/oily skin, but for those with dry or sensitive skin the alcohol might be irritating or overly drying."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this after reading reviews on multiple sites and seeing this toner ranked as one of the best when it comes to drug store brands.I've been using this every night for three weeks (I've skipped it by accident roughly 4 times) and my skin is noticeably clearer. Within a few days I noticed some of my trouble areas looked better and while the clearing process has been slow its noticeable and the progress steady. I also haven't seen a \"new\" blemish since adding this to my regimen.It hasn't done much for blackheads so a few days ago I purchased an exfoliant to address that issue around my nose.Overall I am very happy and will likely repurchase this when it runs out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I use this approximately every other day due to the drying it causes but after a week or so, my pores were visibly reduced, not gone just not as noticeable. Just a splash on a cotton square and I go in upwards motions after my morning face wash and before I moisturize. I will continue to use but will not use everyday as my skin is prone to dryness. It worked in all areas of my face, my nose and forehead were most noticeable to me and now they are much smaller. Recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to reduce size of large pores."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My skin is pretty oily and the pores are larger than I'd like. After using this cleanser for 3 months or so, I do notice a difference.Texture was what I picked up on the first time I used it. It is pretty thick, and the beads are definitely micro. It didn't feel real grainy, which I liked. A little goes a long way, and since this tube is so big it should last a while. I haven't even used a quarter of mine yet.I use this along with Origins Zero Oil Moisturizer and Origins Clear Improvements Charcoal Mask. I found them to be pretty effective at making my pores look smaller, cleaner and less overall oil production. It has a really good price point. Many a department store cleansers can cost 3-4X as much.It does work over time, so don't expect to see much difference in the beginning. I will buy it again and continue my routine. I've seen good improvement in the last few months."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have oily, acne-prone skin that is also sensitive and prone to redness when trying new products. Since Neutrogena's whole advertising campaign from pretty much day one has been all about how gentle their products are, I decided to try this stuff. Well... my face didn't like it. I used it nightly for 3 days, and on day 4 noticed red, dry patches on my face. By day 5 the patches began to flake, and I stopped using it.Since I didn't use this toner long enough to see whether it made a difference in my pore size, I can't speak as to its effectiveness. But if you're like me and have tried many acne products on your face, and have developed sensitive skin as a result, this is not the product for you."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am prone to breakouts and have tried Proactiv - which does work but it is too expensive for me to keep using, especially since my problem is hormonal/occasional. This product fits my needs perfectly. Whenever I see or feel a pimple coming on, I just take a Q-tip immersed in this astringent and clean that area - and that area only. I try not to wipe my whole face with it because it is drying. Last month my whole upper chest/neck area broke out for some reason. That was when I diligently wiped that area 2x a day, morning & night. Took care of the problem immediately."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful about what products I use when I have breakouts on my body (notably my shoulders and back).  My dermatologists recommended that I try the Neutrogrena Body Clear Body Wash, Pink Grapefruit for when I broke out.  She was adamant that I did not use it on a daily basis because my sensitive skin and she is right! This body wash is great for when you breakout during the summer months- the salicylic acid treats your pimples.  It does so quickly and without much irritation to my sensitive skin.  However, I thought because it was rather gentle when I did breakout that I could use it on a daily basis- WRONG.  After using it for about 5 days in a row, my skin was extremely irritated and very dry.  I would recommend that sensitive skin people only use this product when they breakout or KNOW they are going to breakout, otherwise it will dry out your skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have had a really  hard time finding an acne cleaning body wash that I like. They either smell terrible or leave my skin feeling filmy. For me this is the second best smelling one out there. It could, however, do without the silly little pink beads in the soap.I prefer Neutrogena's Stress Control Body Wash for scent but I have a hard time finding it. It seems to be gentler as well. This, however, is really the only substitution if you can't find the Stress one."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this product for several years, and I love it. It smalles wonderful, it rinses clean, unlike some other body washes that I've used that leave residue. It's also not too drying, which is good, because my skin dries out really easily.During the summer, though, I tend to get blemishes on my shoulders and chest, and I've switched to the Neutrogena Body Scrub, which I find deals with acne a little better. It comes in an identical bottle to this, and has some exfoliating beads in it as well. If you don't have to wory about bodily acne, this is a great product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this wash for years since I have sensitive skins and my back breaks out bad.  I use to use the regular wash but when the grapefruit scent came out, I've been hooked.  I love the fresh scent of grapefruit which is a great smell to help wake you up in the shower in the morning.  Also, as I've been using Neutrogena since I was a teenager (like 15 years now)...I am a huge fan of this wash and works great!  I rarely break out and I attribute it to Neutrogena.  The price on Amazon is comparatively priced to my local box stores but I have Prime so it's a nice now to able to buy and have shipped directly to my house without having to make a special trip to the boxed stores.  Thanks Amazon!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product does what it's supposed to.  I don't have a huge acne problem and haven't tried a lot of other products for comparison, but anytime I have occasional break outs this is easy to use and clears it up pretty quickly.  Unfortunately it smells pretty bad.  I can deal with it though because it's effective and I don't have to use it all the time.  I have been wanting to try the pink grapefruit scent but any time I have ever gone into any drugstore anywhere ever it is always sold out.  So..maybe one day when they actually start keeping up with the demand I might get to try it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this product a while ago, and I was so happy with the outcome. After a couple weeks of using it my scalp was no longer itchy (at all) and the flakes went away. It also has a very nice scent. Although it does leave my hair a bit dry, you just need to use a good conditioner and you're all set. I ran out and I had some head & shoulders stored so I used that. Head & Shoulders really sucks compared to the Jason brand. Once my Head & Shoulders is all gone I am going to go back to Jason and stick with it! It works so great."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've found this shampoo in Mom's grocery stores, but they are almost always cheaper online.  It has a gentler formula than let's say selsun blue.  It also has a &#34;fresh&#34; smell.  It does not smell like tea or mint.  However, it is a little on the &#34;runny&#34; side for shampoo and may leave a little &#34;dustiness&#34; to your hair.  I'm not sure if it just makes my hair attract dust, if it's shampoo residue.  It's not noticeable unless you examine your hair under a microscope - which i do."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My husband and I both use this shampoo - he for light dandruff control, and me just because I like the way it cleans my fine hair.  It is paraben-free, and does not contain sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates.  The scent is not as refreshing as the scent of Jason Natural Cosmetics - Satin Shower Body Wash/Tea Tree Oil 30 fl oz Gel, which is a fabulous body wash, but it is not a bad scent.  You do need to watch that it doesn't get in your eyes, since tea tree oil can sting a bit."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My favorite wish is for Jason to make a bigger, less expensive bottle.  This is my favorite shampoo but I rarely buy it because of the cost.  If you have fine, wispy hair this will do wonders for the texture and feel of your hair!  It smells great and, as an added bonus, does great things for your scalp too!  Simply adore it.  Wether it actually THICKENS your hair... I don't know about that, BUT my superfine hair certainly FEELS more lush and lustrous after using this shampoo and conditioner... I just wish I could afford to use it exclusively, but for me this will have to remain a special occasion shampoo.  :(Note:  This stuff is THICK.  I mean it.  Almost like honey."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have problems with thinning hair.  I have been using this product for about a month.  I do believe that it has helped to make my very thin hair a bit thicker.  I don't expect miracles from a shampoo, but I'm happy with the results I've gotten from this product.  I like the fact that it's natural and leaves my hair feeling clean.  The scent is a bit medicinal, but by the time I use my other styling products I don't really notice it anymore. If you have a problem with thinning hair I'd give this product a try."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Jason's natural products are exceptional. I love the body wash and this product tends to be more expensive in stores so that's why I purchase on amazon. If you like the smell of  lavender, this product  will tickle your fancy.  Very nice during shower time.  The soap feels great on your skin and nourishes because it contians Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5 and aloe vera. Jason's body washes are known for no or low sulfides which is good for sensitive skins and the main reason I purchase.  I think what I love the most about this product is the bottle dispenser.  It's so easy to use in the shower and never had a problem with clogging.  It despenses down to the bottom of the bottle.This is a prime product which is a plus too.  Multiple purchase customer and I'll be back again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have used Jason products for many years, mainly because they do not test on animals. I believe that is very important to many people. This body wash lasts a  long time, just one pump onto my fluffy wash thing, (I never know what they call those little round net things we have so many of), anyway, one pump is enough to supply a ton of foaming suds that make you feel so clean and it rinses off so easily. Leaves my skin soft and not dry. I am a great fan of this body wash because I do like tea tree oil for it's antiseptic properties,  and  I also buy the lavender one, for it's soothing effect. I alternate between the two of them.  It is a great bargin for the price considering how much body wash we use.  I think it would be good for a large family of kids because the Koala bear is just too cute."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this for my boyfriend, he loves it. I ended up taking a shine to it as well so now we use it all the time. Tea Tree oil is great for oily skin and this particular wash smells great. We use it as a face wash and have had less break outs since we started using it. Best thing about Jason products is that they are organic, all natural, not tested on animals and contain no animal ingredients. Perfect for vegans or those who just care about what they use on their skin and bodies."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "In the past I've purchased a ton of LUSH beauty products because they make them with lots of essential oils. What I've realized is that I can make some scented liquid soaps myself by using essential oils and this Jason's Body Wash. Simply put a combination of oils in a small plastic bottle and add in some body wash. Shake and use. Some of my favorite combinations are sweet orange, neroli and rose. I've also tried Ylang Ylang, Patchouli, Lotus and Sandalwood. I'm looking forward to trying out new combinations as I have a big collection of essential oils. I also like Balsam Fir Needle which is refreshing. I find the body wash works well with a body brush.~The Rebecca Review"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I started using it only a few weeks ago. I have combination skin. I recommend using a moisturizer with it because I noticed my skin started peeling. Although, my skin looks clearer, some of my old freckles seem to be fading, and I just really notice a difference in my skin. I also feel it helps my vitamin C moisturizer absorb better. I used to use Retin-A and Retin-A micro, but I feel this stuff works just as well, plus it has other ingredients that help improve your skin."}

{"label": 4, "raw": "The first time I used Avalon's Vitamin C eye cream, my eyes began to sting so badly that I was uncomfortable for 24 hours.  I thought that maybe I had used too much, so I tried again several days later with only a tiny amount, being careful to keep it away from my lashes.  My eyes still became uncomfortable. This is the exact opposite of what an eye cream should do.  The whole point of eye cream is to be thick enough not to melt and get into your eyes and, if it does, it should not sting. That's why eye cream is different than face cream. This one fails. I won't be using it again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have used this product for years. I have a dermatological condition called keratosis pilaris which consists of small raised bumps that appear on one side of my forehead and on my arms. This rich cream is actually more effective in minimizing these bumps than the prescription lotion that I have used. I was extremely distressed to read that this company has been purchased by health food giant Hains and that other product formulas have been changed and are no longer effective for whatever they were supposed to do. When I purchased this bottle there was only one left and it is not a new product nor is it manufactured by Hains so I guess I was lucky. If this information is correct then I assume Amazon will be restocking another facial cream that is ineffective. Apart from my particular condition, this cream is a wonderful eye cream. It softens and smooths this area just as you should expect. Can't really recommend it if the formula is being manufactured by another company."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Aside from my standard Olay ORIGINAL moisturizer which I use faithfully every day -- this seems to be the ONLY other product that helps the &#34;vertical&#34; lines that are appearing on the top of my eyelids.  I'm 67 and have tried a lot of products - found most to be rather useless for the money except for the Olay ORIGINAL mositurizer which I have used all my life and now this.  Nice touch before bed as well.  Smell is faint but good.  Very creamy.  Use just a tiny dab -- and the pump is nice in that it only puts out a very small amount - just what you need for the small eye space -- so no waste of product.I have also tried the facial cream from Avalon Organics Vit C  - like it, but this Revitalizing Eye Creme is the one that makes a visible difference on my lines above my eye with repeated daily use."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm only 5 months pregnant but I have no stretchmarks (so far), no itchy belly, and it's kept dryness to a minimum in this cold weather. I use it once a day after the shower, all over. I've been using it since I was 3 months pregnant. I took off one star because it's a big oilier than I'd like, but I did try another (more expensive, lighter oil, mamma mio) product and I started seeing dryness, so I switched back to this Mother's Special Blend. The initial smell is nice (chocolately!) but it goes away in a few minutes."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I recently had a bad case of hives from an allergic reaction to a medicine.This product helped a lot in the short run, which was worth quite a bit. Cooling and soothing. However, I found that after a couple of applications over the course of half a day or so, the product buildup became an irritant in itself, and I had to shower and remove it, which I didn't necessarily feel well enough to want to do. I didn't have that problem with aloe vera gel.However, this product contains a mild local anesthetic, so it may be more helpful for some things. I didn't think of the aloe vera gel until the hives had improved somewhat, so it may not have compared as well in the beginning.I'd buy this again, but I sure hope I don't need to."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this based on the good reviews I read, and had confidence that it would live up to them. It didn't. This mascara smudges and smears very easily. It's allergy season, so my eyes tear a little... but just from that it streaked under my eyes! Other mascaras don't do this at all. The mascara goes on nicely and separates your lashes well, but I can't give it a three-star rating because I can't use it and had to throw it in the trash."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Why haven't I been singing the praises of this little beauty of a mascara?!  I get courted away by $30+ mascaras that flake or never wash off!  Even the drugstore brands lured me away with their fancy brushes and promises of butterfly lashes.  No more!  This stuff doesn't flake, is inky and black, but can be removed w gentle soap and water.  My lashes actually feel conditioned after using this for a few days.  Do yourself a favor and buy this!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "As far as drugstore mascaras go, I have loved Full N Soft for years. Drugstore mascara is inexpensive, so I have often experimented with other brands/formulas - Maybelline, Revlon, L'Oreal, etc., but Full N Soft is the one I come back to. It is great in a single coat and also builds well. If building, I recommend using a clean mascara brush to separate between coats. If during the day your lashes get bent (this happens to me with sun and prescription glasses), use your finger to apply pressure and curve lashes back in place. The flexible formula will re-mold. No flakes, no mess.The brownish-black is natural and minky-coloured. The super black is dramatically black!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "it doesn't wear well under make-up. It's just a little oily. Other than that...I love this product. I use it mainly on my neck and chest (and on my face on my days off) and it has evened out my skin tone and faded my sun-spots ALOT. Especially on my chest...HUGE difference from a few years ago! It really is a great All-in-One Product- I've been using it for years and haven't found a better one yet. I'll keep on buying it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one. It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft. I also love the way you just pump the top and the moisturizer comes out....you don't have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what's left in it. All creams and lotions and such should be this way...I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I've left any germs in the remaining cream. I recommend this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "this is one of my tried and true beauty products; it never fails me. The other night, after using a different (and much more expensive) cream for over a month, I reverted back to using this, and my gosh, I fell in love all over again! I highly recommend this product. It's rich and gives the right amount of moisture without a greasy feel or look. Due to it not having SPF, I use this at night, and use a BB cream during the day."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Olay Total Effect's facial lotion is an excellent everyday lotion.  It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  It has no fragrance and absorbs quickly.  The one issue I have is that it leaves me looking a bit shiny.The bottle that it comes in is small and travels well.  It's easy to pump out the exact amount that you need.I have combination sensitive skin and I've not noticed and issues or breakouts.  I've been using it for about a month now with good results."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I just got Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free this week. I was worried because some reviewers said that they had bad reactions, and that it's not good if you have sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any bad reaction to this.I think the key is not to get the one with SPF. The people who had bad reactions bought the one with SPF. This fragrance free variety without SPF has not given me any problem so far. I am not happy that the product contains parabens though, so I won't buy it again for that reason.So, if you want to try Olay Total Effects, get the one that is fragrance free and does not have the SPF."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I applied this item as directed and it worked great everywhere -- except my cheeks, where it caused burning, irritation, and a very visible rash. My skin is not super sensitive and I've never once had a reaction to a moisturizer/sun screen before. I would STRONGLY suggest testing on a small area unless you're okay with risking walking around with a nasty rash for a couple of days. I have tried it again and it always burns in the same area but is fine everywhere else, not sure why.I understand that reactions vary by individuals, so I didn't think it would be fair to give this item one star. I don't believe it's the product's fault that my skin couldn't handle it, and like I said, it did work well everywhere else. I ordered other Olay products at the same time as this and have used them without incident."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I hate it when my moisturizer slithers of my face like an oil slick, or is so thick you almost have to add water to spread it onto your face. Just one pump of this covers my face, neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute;. Makeup application is smooth, and seems to stay put longer than usual when I use this. I haven't noticed any major changes in the appearance of my fine lines, etcBut I do like he way my skin feels when I use this.  I'd order it again for sure."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I first bought this Olay moisturizer cream because it's unscented.  (Hurrah, if I want perfume, I prefer what I use!)  I've been very happy with it ever since. It's not messy, is easy to apply and has sunscreen in it.  If you wear make-up it'll go over the moisturizer with no problem. The anti-aging must work as I get a lot of comments that I don't look my age! (85) I don't wear make-up except for eyes and mouth, so what people see is what's there, wrinkles and all.Recommend highly."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am almost 33 but people says i look 20 something... They also thought I am still single but I told them I even have a 2 year old daughter! I used this product for 4 years already and until now I am amazed by how it works in my skin. It became smoother, tight and pore less. I love this with spf 15, not only it hydrates the skin but protects as well. This is really my beauty secret for looking young... I eat food so much, drink soda more than water but my skin still radiates plus the help of vitamins i take...So i really thank  olay total effects so much!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried many different brands of moisturizer for my very sensitive skin and found this to be completely non-irritating and it moisturizes well. I don't know what \"anti-aging\" means. I wouldn't say that I look any younger as a result of using it. I like that the same amount comes out each time with one press on the pump--it helps prevent accidentally squirting out too much. And I sure wouldn't want to do that because this stuff costs a whole lot per ounce for those of us on a limited budget. The best deal around is to buy a two-pack on Amazon. That cost will beat a retail purchase by several dollars."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product is amazing. I am 33 years old with combination skin and have always struggled with breakouts. I was looking for something that would prevent aging and reduce the impact of smoking on my skin without causing acne. Olay Total Effects moisturizer has meant incredibly smooth, soft skin and no more breakouts! Plus, it is SPF 15 so there is some sun protection included.Also, unlike most other moisturizers I have used, this absorbs well and does not cause unsightly beads of sweat to form on my forehead after application. The only thing I did not like was the scented version as the smell is insanely oppressive, but there is an unscented version available so that problem is easily solved.I highly reccommend this product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First of all let me say that I have dry skin so I need something that is really going to help me with that and this just didn't do that for me. It didn't break me out or cause irritation but it didn't help with my problem areas either! I have large pores around my nose, chin and forhead, This didn't help tighten those. I have dry cheeks and oily in T-Zone and it didn't help with the dryness AT ALL. If you have perfect skin and you just need a face cream then this is for you. But as an Anti-Ager and all the other stuff it's supposed to do not so much. It didn't brighten my complexion or help even out my skin. So I went back to my Boots No 7 Regimen (See My Review) and I couldn't be happier."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried many different moisturizers.  I've been looking for something that helps with the fine lines, but doesn't make my face greasy or clog my pores.  I love this moisturizer!  It feels like velvet, absorbs quickly, and doesn't cause my face to break out.  The description says it's unscented, but it does have a very, very light fragrance.  It's not perfumey, just fresh and clean.  I'm on my second bottle and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It's hard to know how to review this. I've been using it for a few months and while i haven't noticed any radical changes in my skin (my fine lines are still there), it is still my favorite moisturizer. I decided on this product based on the review at beautypedia.com, it seems to be a reliable product. It goes on very smoothly and dries quickly, you don't need to use too much. It does smell slightly like sunscreen lotion, but I don't mind. I like the pump design, and if you have read up on moisturizers you might have heard that you shouldn't use any product in a jar because it is constantly being exposed to air and bacteria. The packaging, spf, and anti aging aspects are unbeatable at this price (mine was $14 on Amazon at the time)."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Everything has a smell. When Aveeno says that it is fragrance free that means they did not add any external fragrances to the product which can be irritating to some people. This product smells like cooked plain oats when initially applied, but that will go away after it absorbs.Now that that's out of the way, the reason I rated this product 3 stars is because Aveeno seems to have changed its ingredients around from when I first bought this lotion. Oat Flour (Avena Sativa) use to be its FIRST(most abundant) ingredient. Now it's the 7th, and the first ingredient is water, which I think has caused this lotion to be less effective than it used to be for me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I liked that this was light and hydrating for my hands. As an artist, I work with a lot of mediums that require me to wash my hands afterward (i.e. paints, oil pastels), so one can imagine that my hands are prone to dryness. However, after two weeks of use, I got an allergic reaction from the lotion in the form of tiny, non-itchy bumps on the backs of my hands. I gave the rest to my friend who does like Aveeno, but I'll have to search for another hand lotion."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "While I'm not overly enthusiastic about the scent of this unscented product that is easily remedied by the addition of any essential oil I want to add before slathering this on my skin. The main ingredient seems to be Oat Kernel Flour and that is the main reason I buy this product.The skin calming and healing qualities of oatmeal are almost immediately apparent. Within a few days of using this product you will notice a difference in your skin.This lotion absorbs easily, it is smooth, healing and a creamy comforting addition to your day. If you enjoy scented lotions, try the Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion. I also enjoy using the Aveeno Body Wash and Soaps.If you want to scent this product, buy some rose oiland add a few drops. Rose oil helps to balance your emotionsand that in itself will help your skin.~The Rebecca Review"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a nice alternative to the oily sunblocks out there on the market. Sure, it doesn't have the scent of coconut oil, but some of us are allergic to that anyway.So, this is a nice sunblock for us sensitive skin types and it is oil-free and non-irritating, not to mention non-comedogenic. Basically, you can use this on your face and it won't block your pores.This cream seems really rich and creamy and then suddenly it just disappears into your skin and feels very light and not oily.Highly recommended for when you are out and about in the sun this summer!~The Rebecca Review"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I basically lived in the isles of Rite Aid before I found this thing.If you combine it with a sacylic acid cream is it amazing.at night when I have a zit, I clean the area with alochol and apply the cream in the morning wash it off and its shrunk.I repeat everynight until it is completely gone. of course I rub my face in shea butter every morning~ and sometimes bio oil.But, this product is amazing and the price is a lot less than clearisil and others. it really isnt a bad product it is the SAME as clearisiljust less money. (SAME INGREDIENTS) don't be fooled by impaitent and oblivious people. this product works!! :)and if you apply it during day time be sure to rub it in good and apply a moisturizer over it lightly~ hope this helps!!this dosent cure dark spots but it will have yuor face smooth within weeks~ (for me 1 week... for you; mabye more (3weeks?))"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I still got stretchmarks even with religious use of this product. After asking my doctor and reading books and online articles, I'm not sure if stretchmarks is something you can avoid by rubbing in some cream. I think genetics and your body shape plays a factor, too. I mean I have friends who just used plain old olive oil and coconut oil and didn't get stretchmarks. I had friends who didn't do anything and didn't get stretchmarks. Then there are gals that tried everything and still got stretchmarks.I still give it 4 stars because it's inexpensive enough that if you want to try it, it's very affordable. Plus it smells great and has a great texture. Rubs in easily and is a nice way to relax and bond with you baby in utero while giving yourself a little R&R; time and a belly massage. And this cream is very hydrating. I sometimes apply to hands and feet as well and it works great.If you want to try, go for it. Can't hurt!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been wanting to purchase a body oil ever since I received one as a sample. I went to Target one day & unexpectedly found this with the rest of the Palmer's stuff. I didn't even know they had a body oil! I saw the price & quickly put it in my basket. This stuff works so well! Ever since using this after every shower my boyfriend now says all the time how soft my skin is ( he doesn't even know I use body oil!). 4 reasons you should purchase this: Palmer's doesn't test on animals, low price, smells so good, & it works!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I&#8217;m a fan of a lot of Palmers&#8217; products and was looking for a good body oil so I really thought I would like this. Having used baby oil in the past, I was shocked at how quickly this was used up. The baby oil would last easily through the winter and beyond, but this barely lasted a month. The consistency was quite thin and runny, so a lot of it was lost in the process of trying to apply. Then &#8211; possibly because of thinness? -  I felt like I needed more. I have used sweet almond oil in the past and it has a similar consistency. On the bright side, it smelled good and felt good, but because of the above issues I won&#8217;t be buying again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have had a few of these and I love it!!!  I ordered their newer model and ended up giving it to a friend.  I have very thick hair and it tends to be puffy and on the wavy side.  After I blow dry my hair, I use this and it smooths out my hair beautifully.  I can also flip my sides back and the bottom length under.  I hope that this isn't going to be discontinued.  It works way better than their newer model!  Please keep making these.  I recently ordered another because it works so well!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product is not at all good for short hair.  The barrel is huge!  I know the description gives the 1-1/2\" measurement but nowhere does it say anything about hair length recommendations.  I have to wrap my hair around half the brush and hold it there with my hand (hot!) because it doesn't even begin to wrap enough to stay on there.  Slightly better luck with the curling iron attachment.  This will be a fine product if you have at least shoulder length hair.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.  Now I am hoping mine burns up so I can return it at Amazon's expense instead of mine."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It's a great product. I have had two before and my last one, of three years, died finally so I went to buy a replacement but could not find one anywhere. This Hot Air curling iron is a great price and it works great for my hair, which is on the thicker side and wavy. I can do anything from baby-doll curls with this thing to soft shiny waves or use it to shine my hair and give it some shape after straightening. It's a good multipurpose tool.The shipment on this thing was crazy fast. I ordered it and the third day it came to me. I did a test just now to see if it works and it does. Nothing was wrong with the packaging or the product. When I need one again I will defiantly buy from this person/business again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "There are those of us, of a certain age, who never managed the technique of holding a hair dryer and a round brush at the same time.  We grew up in the era of long natural straight hair.  Now we live at a time when more styling devices are required.  This is a great tool for getting curl or body into hair while holding only one object.  Be sure to have your hair damp-dry before you start, or styling will take forever.  The motor is small, and doesn't &#34;blow&#34; very strongly.  Get the majority of the water out of hair first, and you will be ok."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've had a conair facial sauna for years (and it was still working fine when I lost/misplced it) so I had to try another Conair.Well, this is perfect, even better than the first one I got. Why? It's got that safety timer, it tells you when it's ready, it comes with two cones to choose from. Plus, it comes with this free exfoliating brush and sponge. So nice. I used it last night and now my skin's glowing beautifully, like it got a polishing. It's a nice way to pamper yourself.Great price too!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This didn't put out much steam, and wasn't very hot. Maybe it's because I'm in the mountains and water produces steam at a lower temp. up here. Anyway, I had a better facial with a pot of boiling water, and had to return this. UPDATE 2011: Want steam??? Use a \"My little steamer\" mini clothing steamer!!! CAUTION: Keep at least 12-15 inches away from your face.  I used distilled water, and this thing really puts out steam, and in less than a minute too! Remember...do not put it too close to your face!!! It generates VERY HOT STEAM!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this product to alleviate symptoms from seasonal allergies. Every spring  my eyes itch and I'm constantly sneezing. Most allergy medications are too expensive and/or ineffective or cause drowiness. After researching the benefits of steam treatements for people like me I purchased the Conair Facial Sauna. I realize this product is designed for cosmetic reasons but it does the same thing the more expensive allergy/sinus steam machines do for a third of the price. I used it at night for 5 minutes and my eyes stop itching and I get restful sleep. I don't know if this product makes the skin glow as some other reviewers have claimed but it couldn't hurt. I would purchase again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love this machine. Could I say anymore...I will. I like to keep my face clean, and steam is the easiest, safest and more effective way to do this. It really clears the pores and gets all the gunk out, while adding moisture to the skin, then I rinse with cool water and put on a mask and my skin is happy and clean. You can use it every day, or night and the results will be amazing.It works well for your sinuses too. I put this on my counter and lean over it, just don't wiggle it or hit it while it is on. It has been safe for me and heats up fast. I really love my machine.The brush was great, it worked well to cleanse before the steam, but it isn't waterproof and eventually broke."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this system at a \"Bed, Bath, and Beyond\" store. I used it, and I really did like the whole Facial Sauna System. However, not too long after using the system, problems did occur. The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down & eventually fell apart...And there's really no way to order a replacement. The other problem was that the actual Facial Tool eventually stopped working. I thought perhaps I needed to replace the batteries, although when I put new batteries in, it still did not work. So the only thing left that still works is the Facial Steamer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For those of you that really wants a great facial steam, this product doesn't neccessarily perform the greatest. Its good but it doesn't cover the entire face. With a facial steam, you want to be able to cover the entire face --- in this case, I would suggest going to the gym where they have a STEAM ROOM. But again, this product is not a bad buy... i just don't use it much after 1-2 uses.. because i don't think the effect is really great."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this steamer for the last 9 years.  My first lasted about 8 years, but got a little crusty by the end of it.  The timer option is great so  I don't have to keep track of time.  This one includes a convenient measuring cup.  I wasn't crazy about the exfoliation tool (prefer to use a combo of Cetaphil and baking soda), but I guess it does the job.  I use the steamer about 2x a week for blackheads."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't use too much makeup, maybe concealer sometimes, but my skin is super duper oily. So even if I use a sunblock, after a few hours, my skin will be very oily. So I use this sheets to remove the oil from my face. Its very easy to use- just take a sheet from the package and press it against your skin and that's it! The sheet will turn transparent as soon as it absorbs the oil from your skin. It saves so much time since applying powder foundation to your skin after every 2-3 hours is such a hassle."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used this during the day for a couple months in conjunction with the Q10 night cream and it seemed to help soften the wrinkles I had started to notice.  Doesn't aggravate my acne prone skin and I like this lotion better than the night cream since the consistency is light and absorbs well and the smell is very minimal (plain suntan/lotion smell).  Works fine under my makeup.  Would be great if they offered it with a slightly higher spf to last just a bit longer (since I don't reapply over my makeup)."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For me the lotion is too greasy for my face so I use it for hand lotion.  I also purchased the 2-pack of Eucerin Q10 Cream which is really good for the back of the hands and I will certainly use it for that.  However, the Q10 Anit-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion is just too greasy for my face which is already oily.  I suppose for ladies with \"dry\" skin it would be a good thing.  But as I've said I will use it as a hand lotion"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this lotion for quite some time - probably about 9 months now, and I absolutely love it. It's lightweight and oil free and it makes a great base under foundation too. I love that it contains SPF too. A nice feature this product has is that it doesn't leave that whitened look on your skin after application as a lot of lotions with sunscreen do. As far as the wrinkle prevention Q10 is concerned I haven't noticed any lessening of my lines of my face, but I also haven't noticed any new ones either so maybe it's preventing new wrinkles? Anyhow, this is a very nice lightweight SPF that feels nice on your face and won't break you out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This curling iron is pretty good, but it does not have a strong enough spring to keep hair in place when curling. I have learned to correct this by hair-spraying the strands of hair I am about to curl. Then I clamp the hair under the metal clip about an inch or two up from the end of the strand. If you try to clamp your hair at the tip--it will not hold. You have to start an inch or two up from the edge to get it to hold. But if you do that, and if you hair spray it first--this curler can make some excellent spirals. I give this item 4 stars because it was basically the cheapest ringlet curler I could find. And this product does give me the curl I want, it just takes a little bit of finesse. But if you want something stronger and easier to use, look elsewhere."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Doesn't heat up enough.  I had it on my hair for 20 seconds without it feeling hot to the touch, on the highest setting.The on/off buttons are in the way and I turned it off by mistake at least 3 times just trying to curl the front of my hair, before I gave up and used another iron.I did get a cute curl once, but it went away by the time I did the next strand.  I knew I hated Revlon curlers, but this was the biggest one I could find at the store.  Hopefully the store will take the curling iron back unwrapped."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Okay, so I'm a guy... but yes, once a week I scrub my face with St Ives Swiss Formula Apricot Scrub.  I have gone through this ritual for about 20 years now.  I'm not crazy about the new scent, but this brand name item is the best out there.  (I've used the generic).  I'm 45 years old while writing this review... but I look at least 10 years younger.  Is it because of St Ives or is it genetic?  I'll never know... but I'm going to continue to use this product until I die.  Keeps my face smooth (makes it easier to shave with an electric) and keeps my pores open.  That's about all I ever wanted to use this for and I believe it serves it's purpose."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The first time I used this product (over a year ago), I almost cried. A hypoallergenic moisturizer that was hydrating AND brightening AND from a brand that is organic and eco-friendly?? Heck yes! It worked wonders for my dry, hypersensitive skin.However, this is the second time I've purchased this and something seems&#8230; different. It's less hydrating (I have to apply at least two layer for any moisture benefits) and almost feels itchy (although that may be due to the lack of moisturizing powers it has, not the formula itself). However, it still brightens and smells nice. I just use it in combination with another hypoallergenic moisturizer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very sensitive facial skin.  The slightest fragrance or unassuming offending chemical can cause rashes, stinging and all sorts of unpleasantness.I have tried many, many products. From high end premium brands to drugstore brands. I have found some high end brands that are truly great, but also very expensive.So based on reviews her on Amazon, and the reasonable price,  I decided to try Eucerin Q10. I have been using it for five days, and I love it. It is a thick, rich cream  goes on smoothly and is absorbed rapidly. Skin feels really moisturized after application. I use it in the morning before makeup application and again at night before bed. Smooth skin and no irritations!I can't say if it will deliver on promise to reduce facial line. I'll let you know in six months.For those who are paraben sensitive, this creme does contain parabens. The creme is also a yellow color, which the box describes as being the intended color (result of natural ingredients)."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm a cashier at Rite aid, and this guy came to my check stand and bought 2 of the Eucerin Q10 cremes. I asked him if it worked well, and his answer was pretty much \"it's amazing and only rite aid sells it!\"So since it was buy one get the second one 50 % off I decided to get the Q10 and the night creme.I get very dry skin, def when the whether is cold. It gets peely and red and it's awful to deal with. Also, I tend to break out with this whether. I opened the container and I was happy that is was truly fragrance free (my skin will break out with fragrances). The yellow color is from all the natural ingredients, it's not bad at all. It's a thicker cream, but when I apply it in the morning I can put make up over it and work all day and everything is good! My dry, red skin is gone too. This creme is amazing. :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Used for about 2 months.  Did seem to help soften the wrinkles that I had started to notice.  Product absorbs quite well and isn't overly greasy although consistency is rather thick.  I have acne prone skin and dry skin areas and while it did not aggravate my acne it didn't really help the dry areas either (surprising considering the consistency).  I hate strong perfume-y night cream on my face when I'm trying to sleep (which is one of the reasons I don't care for olay products) and this product could pass exactly for a tub of margarine or butter for color, smell, and texture.  It was better than perfume but I didn't exactly love it, either."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a lot like the Nivea Visage Q10 that stopped coming to the US and you can buy online still (made by the same company, Beiersdorf, in their factory in Poland). It's impressively cheap, it moisturizes really well, you can use it morning or night, it has no fragrance or dye, so you can use it around your eyes without them getting red or swollen.Negatives - it doesn't have the immediate effectiveness that retinol products do, then again you can't use those during the day. Also, an sunscnreen would make this more useful. I'm not a fan of using many different lotions, so I'm unlikely to buy this again, as it's neither an ideal night nor day lotion, even if it is a great value and a solid product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Better late than never! This cream is amazing, it's rich without being super greasy and has vitamins (A, C, E), no oils, no parabens, fragrance free it's very gentle yet effective. I love it and its now a staple for me. I don't know why Eucerin dosent advertise this face cream especally since it has vitamin C and E which is all the rage in anti-aging face products.My only gripe is that it needs to be in a tube not a jar because of the vitamins.Ingrediants: Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotine, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this product for almost a year now and as with all Eucerin products it is the best. There are products on the market that are selling for 5 times what this cost and this is every bit as good. I'm 70 years old and look 10 to 20 years younger. This product makes my facial skin soft and moist looking. The first few times I applied it I could feel my skin tightening particularly around the eyes. I use about a jar a month as I apply it morning and evening."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First off, I do have slightly oily skin, so people with normal or dry skin would probably have a better time with this product.I got this pretty cheap, so for the price I can't complain much. I wanted to try it and now I have, and for me at least, it was just 'okay'.I found the cream a little too thick, and it felt a little greasy after use. It was okay for using at night, but I want a cream I can use before I put my makeup on too.However, I will say that it is indeed good for sensitive skin. I never experienced any redness or itchiness like with some products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've come to the conclusion if the product is advertised as Anti-Wrinkle it ain't going to work and more than likelydo nothing but lay on your skin like a mast.Olay Regenerist  is the same way it actually feels like heat on your skin.  This one doesnt feel like that, it just feels like you are wearing a mask and the pores in your face are clogged.After seeing the horrors of plastic surgery and the Contour debacle where threads are inserted into your skin to pull the face up... frankly just face the fact your never going to look like your were even in your 40's.Time and nature will have their way with you.  Matter of a fact if wrinkles are all you have got, be glad there are so many ills and deseases to confront you as you make this short journey in your life, just be yourself."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I like this mask a lot. I wanted something a little less drying than my purifying mint mask and since this has avocado in it I thought it would be a nice alternative. It's very nice and applies easily and my skin feels softer after I use it without feeling like it's stripped me of all moisture. Don't get me wrong, it's not the same effect as using a moisturizer or anything - you're still going to lose some moisture - but it's not nearly as drying as some masks I've used before."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "i went to the drugstore looking for queen helene's mint julep mask, but i couldn't find it, so i picked this up instead. i really like this mask as well, it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it's very easy to rinse off. i have sensitive skin and i haven't had any breakouts or adverse reactions to it after using it. the only things i don't like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them, and it's a little itchy when it dries."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have struggled with acne, blackheads, and scars since age 11. I have tried lots of products and seen dermatologists with little help. Now, about to turn 30 and still dealing with these issues, I tried this product after all of the reviews. I cannot tell you how amazing this is. It's so affordable, too. Admittedly, I use it 1 to 2 times a day for my best results. My pores are much clearer and squeezing the blackheads on the nose, which my esthetician used to do, (the only place I would squeeze d/t scarring), has become much easier and I have to do it less frequently with regular use. For the price, I would recommend everyone try it until the product is gone and see how it goes for you!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I use the Freeman Cucumber Facial Mask religiously, once a week, followed by Queen Helene's Mint Julep mud mask. After exfoliating I apply this mask for fifteen minutes - it's kind of fun marching around the house looking like a burn victim (the mask goes on clear and shiny, and dries clear and shiny) - before peeling it off and applying the mud mask for fifteen minutes. The mud mask is excellent for standing in clear view by your front window as the neighbor mows his lawn or answering the door for the FedEx guy so you can sign for a package. It's such a conversation starter.Anyhow, after moisturizing my skin is good to go for the week, and it's consistently clear and fresh thanks to this mask."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "this one happens to be my least favorite. it has an extremely pungent alcohol smell to the point that it will have your eyes watering. applying it to the skin is like applying very, very thick honey. on the plus side, it is EXTREMELY cooling and invigorating as it is drying. i also enjoy peeling it off and find that the majority of it does come off in one piece, but some glue-like remnants sometimes get stuck to my eyebrows and that is not fun to scrape off. i most likely will not be buying this product again. i recommend sticking to the clay masks that freeman has to offer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If you are looking for a peeling mask this one is pretty good.  It dries fast and you can get a good peel with it - all in one sheet. It seems to help to control my sons acne a little.I made the mistake of after the mask, using a blackhead tool and clearing out anything that came to the surface --- well everything came out easily but he was left with a face full of red marks and scabs for like a week, so I felt terrible. It draws everything to the surface and leaves the skin extra soft and sensitive and more easy to tear and damage.So I'd recommend just using the mask - and not picking after! I've used it several times without picking and it's been fine."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a fun product to buy and it actually works well. If you are going to use this I would suggest applying the product liberally so that you do not have a thin layer but a nice thick one. I also suggest leaving this product on for longer than 10 minutes, maybe around 15 so that it really gets to dry. Before you apply the product pull back your hair because it can get a little annoying when the product gets stuck to your hair. I would also be mindful not to get any on your eyebrows cause it can get inbetween the little hairs.Once you remove the mask you'll find that your skin is nice and soft and less oily. It does remove dead skin but do not anticipate removal of blackheads. It also leaves you with a nice soothing/cooling sensation afterwards."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First of all, it does pull out stuff from your pores, bet very little bit. Just to explain: if you use strips on your nose (I think most of the girls know what strips I talk about), then you pull it out, you see some pore stuff left on the strip, but most of pores still not cleaned. So this mask working much less than strips for nose. It takes some stuff out, but its nothing, doesn't make sense to use.I couldn't find some good pore cleaner, until I try proactiv. Even if you have no pimples, try to buy just a cleanser from proactiv (the first one from regular kit), it's like a scrub, but it's first scrub in my life that really clean pores instead of scratching skin. So, put the scrab on DRY face, scrab it all for minute, especially your nose. After 2-3 use your pores will be clean. I promise."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This won't take off blackheads or renew your skin overnight, but for what you pay for its ok. It does make my skin softer, reduce some redness, and has a calming smell. I mainly use this with my younger sisters when I visit from College. It breaks a bit when you peel unless you are very slow about it. When applying to your face you might want to make sure you have water on the side to start washing your hands off, its very sticky and needs a bit of soap to get off! Imagine applying it then turning the water on, you'll get the handle nasty. If that happens just wait to peel it off when it dries, but kinda annoying if you have OCD!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This really is a good hair dryer, it gets very hot which I love and dries the hair quickly.  I have long hair and it didn't take me long at all to dry it.  The dryer itself is pretty heavy but that was not a problem for me, to others it may be though.  The reason I gave this product a 3 is because I bought it on Sept 4 2010 and finally just had to replace it about 2 months ago because it started to make the most god awful noise when I would use it, I can only describe the noise as slowly murdering a cat behind the engine of a plane.  I do like conair products and it was definitely a good dryer and lasted me for quite a while."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have long wavy hair and I bought this because it came with a diffuser attachment. It clicks in no problem (as well as the concentrator but I've only used it once) and you can easily take it off. The cord is longer so if you have a larger bathroom, it helps. It also has a hook on the base of the handle, you can kind of see it in the picture, which helps with storage if you choose to hang it up. I use it on the hot heat, low setting and I don't see a lot of frizz even without product. It dries my hair quickly without it being noisy. But if you use it on the high setting, it gets noisy. Overall, I love this dryer. So far. I'll post another review if anything bad happens to the dryer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this hair dryer after my old one seemed to be taking a long time to dry my very long hair. I also had just bought another ionic hair drying tool and I loved how it helped prevent my hair from getting frizzy. I went to the store and tried out a bunch of hair dryers ranging up to $200 and this one seemed to be just as powerful as some of these very expensive dryers. I also loved that it was ionic. It does a great job at drying my hair and the attachments are really great too. I also paid double in the store for what it is listed at here."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This hair dryer is heavy. And pretty huge. Also, it's hard to hold it by the handle because the rocker switches for power and heat are in the way of your fingers, so you have to practice in order to not change the settings during use. When set on hot/high, the velocity of the air is very good, but it's not hot at all -- the air is barely warm -- which is fine for drying, but certainly not good for styling. It did minimize my static flyaway hair, but since I had to use my old &#34;hot&#34; dryer to style, I lost that benefit and had to add leave-in conditioner to de-electrify my hair. The price was good, hence the two stars, but I don't recommend. Probably better for short hair."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "With below the shoulder hair, I found this to dry it quickly and without burning.  I have fine, thick hair so usually it takes 10 minutes or more to dry ... and other dryers run so hot that they burn if focused in one spot for more than a moment (to set a wave, for instance).  This gets just hot enough to be safe and pleasant to use.The finger-attachment might be useful if someone else is styling your hair, but my arms (I'm 5'9\") aren't long enough to make its use practicable.Two speeds, two heat settings (plus cold-shot button) actually give a very usable range for drying efficiently.  Took me less time than with my previous dryer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't have any particular scars but I wanted my skin tone to even out so I didn't have to bother with makeup. This stuff doesn't smell great nor is the texture wonderful but I do like the way my skin looks. I usually wear it at night and in the morning I use a Vita C lotion (which smells and feels great) and a simple face lotion with sunscreen. This doesn't make me break out and isn't drying. I am a lucky adult with acne so some lotions are trouble. I also have the skin tone evening face mask by palmers, which I notice more impact from than the face cream. My skin always looks fantastic after I use it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used Alba See Moss Moisturizer daily religiously for over a year - no problems and you can't beat the price. I apply after morning wash, before applying foundation. I don't use the coordinating wash all the time. Most of Alba's products have impressed me for the price, this line is formulated especially for malasma, which is what drew me to it in the first place. I use the Alba Sea Moss night cream also with a hyaluronic acid gel from Reviva Labs to help with tone and discoloration. My skin looks great and I always get compliments on how nice my skin looks. Definitely recommend for women who are 35+ and have skin discoloration from too much sun or hormonal changes. So until this causes problems or Alba discontinues it, I'll keep doing what I'm doing."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this for about 2 weeks now. I got this product hoping it would be a huge turn around for my overly dry skin. And while sadly my skin is still dry, it is less harsh than regular body washes out there and leaves me feeling very moisturized after a shower. However, the relief only seems to last mere minutes. I'm still having to use lotion all over my body on a daily basis. Maybe my results will change with the season as right now its winter and the air is fairly dry, but I'm not so sure.  The smell isn't horrible, but its also not great. And when I received the package body wash had leaked all per inside the box and all over the bottle. That Was something I was most definitely not happy with. I will probably, however, continue to use the product as organic stuff is still healthier for your skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The smell is fantastic but I wished it was stronger and lasted longer; though maybe this would be good for someone who wants scented body wash but who are sensitive to overpowering scents. My husband even loves the smell. I was happy that there is a good amount of lather since most shampoos that are sulfate free do not have any lather. I even used it as a shampoo and it did not dry my hair out at all! I have since tried the tropical scent of this body wash and I prefer it more over the honey mango."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've already have this product and ordered it in January. I decided to come online and write about how well its working and I plan to order more soon! I am a dark skinned african american women and have had discoloration on my face for years until I began to use this product. I only use this product, suncreen, along with carbolic soap and have seen a DRASTIC improvement. I was scared this would burn my skin or make me itch because I suffer from eczema and tend to have sensitive skin but no problems whatsoever! :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I really think if your skin is like leather this is for you.  Otherwise, stay away.  I followed the directions and then started cutting back when I noticed it was turning into red splotches.  I finally quit after a week or so.  I was so embarrassed to go out of the house.  All I wanted was to get rid of the red spots that were left after pimples came and left.  I am a strawberry blonde with fair skin.  The alpha hydroxy is the culprit.  I had high hopes.  This product deserves zero stars."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I couldn't wait to get this eye pillow. I read the reviews and was hoping that the scent wasn't too overpowering. Well it came last night, I opened the box expecting a beautiful scent of lavender and I can BARELY smell the scent. I don't know if I just received one that was older or what, but when I used it last night the lavender was so faint that even holding it up to my nose didn't work. I love the fabric and it's very well made, just doesn't smell...is there something you can do?"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Years ago someone gave me one of this type eye pillow and I have loved it.  The fragrance was very soothing and really aided my relief from migraines.  The company that manufactured it has since been sold and I was looking for a replacement.  DreamTime is the perfect replacement.  It has the exact aroma and is well made as was the first one.  I also have ordered one for my daughter and she enjoys hers as well.  I recommend to these to everyone I know who has migraines."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "YUCK! I am really starting to think many of these rave reviews are fake, because go on over to Makeupalley and everyone else hates this product as well. I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product, until this one. It was literally unusable. It made my face look muddy, not natural at all. And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face, even though I didn't use that much! It just looked so bad, I didn't feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all. Buy at your own risk"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My lashes are long, thick but unfortunately straight  I only use the mascara to highlight them and keep them curled after using the curler on them.I have been using Estee Lauder&iexcl;s product for but a friend insisted this is just as good. Estee&iexcl;s mascara is $20+ for a new tube. I figured I have only $5 to lose if this works just as well.I&iexcl;m impressed. I really like this product. I now own both the regular and waterproof. No clumping or flaking.Cannot believe I&iexcl;ve been paying for Estee Lauder all these years when this works just as well for me. The only negative is I really dislike the tiny, hard brush and prefer Estee&iexcl;s brush but for this price I can definitely get past that."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product gives you good coverage without looking heavy or leaving a line of demarcation at your neckline. It doesn't have a chalky or powdery look, and has an added bonus of sunscreen. I usually prefer a cream matte foundation, but this Maybelline Purestay Powder & Foundation gives me excellent results as well. If you find that you need a little extra coverage for whatever reason, this powder also goes on looking natural on top of other cosmetics -- just use a light touch in applying.This makeup has excellent staying power, and that's what really counts. Who has time to keep checking in a mirror and retouching your face all day long? I never once felt the need to do my face again during the day!This is a good value at a fair price. Recommended!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the best foundation I have ever used.  It is easy to apply, completely covers and evens the skin tone, and stays on all day without clumping up.  Like the other reviewers, I appreciate that it dries matte.  I tried it because I have lupus and live at a high altitude, so I need extra UV protection.  So far so good.  The ability to lighten and darken the tone is great, although I do wish there were a way to add cooler/pink tones, since it is a tad yellowish.  That being said, I get lots of compliments about my skin when I wear this and, hey, I feel pretty!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This sunblock provides great physical sun protection.  It is good for people who have normal or combination to oily skin.  It feels a little heavy on your face but not as gross or greasy as regular sunblock or sunscreen.  It actually provides decent coverage and evens out your skin tone quite nicely.  The concept of being able to adjust the color of the foundation is pretty cool.  I wish cosmetic companies would provide regular foundations with this concept.  The color is pretty neutral, neither warm nor cool toned.  I could see, however, that on darker skin tones it could possibly be a little ashy due to the mineral sunblock content."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have trouble with sunscreen causing breakouts and this almost never causes blemishes.  I also have come to hate the smell of typical sunscreen and this doesn't have that smell.  I have light to medium tone Caucasian skin with some yellow undertones and this is so thick it can double as foundation makeup.  It says it dries clear, but it's a little chalky and would probably really look bad if you have dark or ethnic skin.  I have read that the tinted kind doesn't blend well with Asian skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I started using this product about 4-5 months ago and I must say, I love this scrub! Its better than most scrubs I've used. Its gentle on skin, beads are very fine and it doesnt irritate my skin, smells heavenly and best of all, it doesn't make my skin break out nor makes it more oily. I've always had acne and had mild to moderate amount of acne scars on my face as well, with daily use for several months, I've started to notice that the scars are fading away, not completely gone but much less visible than before. Will definitely repurchase this! Also, price is great and a lasts a good while."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used the Olay Regenerist cleanser, St. Ives scrub, Neutrogena, Estee Lauder, Ahava - need I go on? But I really like this Aveeno scrub (though \"scrub\" is a bit of an overstatement considering how small the beads are). I like the citrusy smell and the way it cleans gently. I wish it were a little more scrubby but I can't seem to find something that's about half way between this and the super-rough St. Ives so I'll stick with this until I do."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This stuff isn't very moisturizing at all. It has SPF 30 which automatically makes it thicker, plus the tint, this is just as moisterizing as foundation. I don't use foundation so I like that this is a very light foundation substitute, and that's what I would call it, not a moisterizer. I mix mine with grapeseed or emu oil so that it goes on slick and not cakey. When combined with my facial oil, I love the stuff..... But by itself? No good.Also I have moderate acne which I try VERY hard to keep under control, and this product does NOT make me break out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love these. Minus one star because they are almost either too large, or too soapy. I cut them in half because I feel like I am wasting product at the end because their is a lot left in the pad. The cleanser is very gentle, and I really like the exfoliating side of the pad. Very useful for when I am in a hurry and don't have time to do my whole skin care routine. I also like to use them in the morning if I need a quick cleanse or if I wake up and my face is a little oily."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My dermatologist recommended this brand of spf 30 for daily use because I have Rosecea.  I love this brand because it gives me a nice fresh glow if I don't wear makeup and it is easily worn under makeup because it's not greasy.  I've tried many other brands and probably my 2nd choice would be Eucerine's spf30 for face.  But I still say this is the best because it doesn't feel like you've got sunscreen on.  It seems to stay on well during exercise too, because I alway put it on when I go for bike rides and never burn."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This scrub replaces the Neutrogena scrub that my daughter and I used. I bought the Neutrogena for myself and as she progressed into a tween she needed a scrub too. She didn't care for the smell of the Neutrogena but it did work very well. I had been buying the Aveeno acne pads for her and decided to get this for the night time routine. She loves the smell and the texture and I love the great price. It leaves a soft glow to her skin and her face never feels oily.This combined with the Aveeno pads, a daily moisturizer with SPF 15 UV protector in the morning, followed by this at night, seems to be doing the trick for keeping acne at bay and keeping her young face bright and healthy.Don't tell her but, dad is using it too now."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "STAY AWAY FROM IT IF YOU WEAR CONTACTS AND HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. I put this on my face and it felt alright for the first hour. I noticed my eyes started getting irritated and a rash on my forehead. My eyes looks stressed and was red. I didn't put this on the next day and my eyes felt way better and no rash. However my face is red from the irritation from this sunscreen. This product seems like the perfect choice for me:A daily moisturizer that has clinically proven Total Soy Complex and natural light diffusers that work to naturally even out skin toneGentle enough for sensitive skin and daily useOil freeHypoallergenicNoncomedogenic(won't clog pores)but the result turned out to be a bad product for me...I wish I could get my money back. If you wear contacts do not buy this. This product has a very heavy scent that will irritate your eyes and you will be desperate to take your contacts off....."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm not sure if it's because I'm used to foam, but this product doesn't do it for me. I was very disappointed. I should state however that I have a very clear youthful complexion with combination skin.  I think this would work well for those with dry skin because it feels a little too heavy after washing with mine.  It does feel silky but like I said for someone with combination skin it might be too greasy/heavy. I feel like I'm wearing makeup. I'm certain that if my skin was dry I would love it though."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I work in Afghanistan and had a hard time keeping any time of make-up on in the summers because of the heat.  I would sweat it off immediately.  I got this in the hopes of it staying on a little better, giving me some protection from the sun and being able to reapply through the day without it looking like I just added another layer of foundation.  This is pretty much a very light foundation.  I don't think it moisturized my face at all and it didn't cover any red spots or blemishes.  I was disappointed because I normally love Aveeno products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I work full time and go to school at night so I was looking for a product that I could throw on in a hurry that was able to stand in place of make up. I have combination skin so a moisturizer was just what I was looking for. At first I LOVED this product! It covered quiet well and was very moisturizing. However, I only wore it for 4-5 hours at a time while I was in class. I later tried it on a weekend and noticed I had some minor break outs. The more I used it the more I broke out. Then I noticed there is SHIMMER in it! If you have acne shimmer will accentuate your break outs. Awful!Pros:Coverage; Not quite as good as make up but able to stand inSmell; VERY light smell of sun tan lotion, other than that unscentedFeel; It goes on pretty thick but absorbs into the skin well so you don't feel too greasy. Heavier than my normal face lotion, thoughSPFCons:SHIMMER!Caused break outs"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I wanted a stronger SPF and decided to try the 30. As is usually the case, I don't care much for the texture of this higher SPF. Otherwise it's okay. Unless you really need a higher SPF, you'll probably like the feel of the SPF 15 better. This one seems greasy. I have combination skin, but even when I dried out this winter I didn't care much for the texture of it. The extra grease didn't seem to help my dry skin problem either! It just made me shiny lol. I still use this (just to finish the bottle), but only mixed with make up.I haven't tried the tinted version of this moisturize because they don't make it in brown *ahem!*. :-)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Bought this today at Publix (our local grocery) on clearance for $8.00.  I really didnt need a sunscreen, just a tinted moisturizer as I dont like to wear foundation in Fla. in the hot humid season.  I read the other reviews and (1) The texture is due to the spf30 and quickly absorbs into the skin.  (2) Dont buy this if you have very dry skin as it is a lighweight moisturizer.  The fair to light works fine for me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I work fast food so you can imagine how terrible that is for someone with sensitive oily acne prone skin. I went to spend some time with my sister straight after work one day and she had me use these and WOW is the best way to describe these wonderful things. My face felt completely clean like it cleaned away all of my makeup and i felt it cleaning my pores. I looked at my face the next day and it looked so much clearer than it has in years. I will definitely be buying some of my own and i recommend these to everyone who want a clear and clean face."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used a lot of tinted moisturizers and as a rule I LOVE Aveno prouducts. To due skin cancer and using Renova, I have got to SPF my skin all year.I love Aveno products & my skin lady uses them after treatment. I am a natural platinum blonde so i go from very pale in the winter to a light tan as the weather warms.In general, this is a good quality product with adequate coverage & excellent SPF protection &  while transparent it also evens out the complexion. I believe it has a powder base as this seems to sink into large pores and deep lines. TO avoid this, I put 3 drops of a higher SPF &  mix it into the Aveno and then apply. This takes care of the problem.I also bought the light and medium and mix the two together to get the perfect shade. I store it mixed in a clean glass baby food jar & capped tight."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this for several weeks now in the morning (I use something else at night) and it works well.  The bottle is very nice but one pump doesn't seem like enough so I always have to do at lest two.  I use this with my Clarisonic face brush and it lathers up very nice.  Everyone has different skin and everyone's skin reacts differently to products.  This product hasn't broken me and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.  It doesn't hydrate it as by the time I have my hair dried with the hair dryer I feel like I need some face lotion on.  But I feel this is pretty typical for my skin during the winter months as it gets pretty dry.  I would repurchase this cleaner in the future and would recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love these but feel a bit profligate ordering something I could probably concoct at home. There appears to be some mild soap, witch hazel and aloe applied to compressed fiber pads which are disposable....Not very green. I use them more than once because they lather so richly and after two uses, I clean my sink and vanity with them. They don't strip my skin of all of its oils and leave my face feeling fresh without any irritation. The only improvement would be to have the lotion and use my own wash cloths...."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My boyfriend and I both have very fair skin that's prone to redness. Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist is a little too orange and shiny on its own. But mixed with Eucerin Redness Relief moisturizer, it's the perfect moisturizer to cover up small imperfections, reduce redness, and provide a natural-looking tone. By itself on my boyfriend, it looks like he's wearing some sort of shimmery makeup. But mixed with the Eucerin Redness Relief (which is green in color), it looks very neutral and natural. I also love the SPF 30!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Ok, i love aveeno products but this is a total FAIL!! And a waste of $$ for that matter. I'm on a budget, and i was looking for something budget-friendly from a drug store. After all the hype about this product, i decided to give it a try. First of all, the scent was overbearing, too greasy, my skin is combination/oily, and this made it worse!! I was extremely oily all day even make-up didn't help. I also developed a rash on my T-zone. I'm a very patient person so i stuck with it for a month before dumping it! Started using St.ives and so happy with the results not to mention the price is 2 less for what i paid for this junk! Too bad i won't get my hard earned $$ back!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had one of these decades ago when I blow dryed my hair and used hot rollers -- I thought the towel was great.  I recently bought another, as my hair is very long and naturally curly (it has to air dry).  First of all, this towel will not stay twisted in a turban while I put on moisturizer, etc., and second, it soaks up so much moisture that my hair dries frizzy (even with product on it).  I'm dissappointed with my purchase, and would not recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair that need to be air dried."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very thick, coarse hair and was tired of wrapping my head with the standard cotton towel at home. Plus, the towels were always rough on my hair and would get soggy immediately. I purchased this towel to put less stress on my hair follicles and to improve the drying time.I was very excited that I was able to wrap all of my hair in the towel (about arm-pit length, 4b/4c, coarse) and it stayed put. No problems there at all. However, I noticed that the towel started to get really soggy after about 30 mins. I had to take it off and squeeze it out.I think this is mainly because my hair type holds onto water much more than others and because the towel is pretty small. So, the next time, I just made sure that I squeezed as much excess water out of my hair as possible before wrapping and it was not as bad.I really like the towel but it is definitely not totally equipped to handle all hair types."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been losing hair for some time and I'm pretty sure the reason is all the blow drying and product I use to &#34;protect&#34; my hair from the heat process.I found this towel on Amazon by accident and figured I have nothing to lose...but more hair...so I bought it.I had to re-dampen sections of my hair to apply mousse cause it was almost completely dry after having it wrapped for about 5 minutes.I can see this towel coming with me on all my vacations!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Bought this to use at the pool. I like that it's thin. I would say the absorbency is the same as a regular thick towel (not moreso, but it's super thin so I'm still a fan). I have loads of long hair, and I still find this towel a bit too big. It's not quite big enough for a full body towel, so I wish it were smaller or bigger, and less in between. Thought about trying a hair turban, but I suspect they're not as user-friendly (especially for tons of hair) as they appear.But overall I'm pretty happy with it. Again, love the light, thiness. Perfect for the gym."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this towel to wrap around my hair because normal bath towels make my hair frizzy. This towel definitely cuts down on frizz and makes my hair look much more tame. It is the perfect size to wrap my head with and does not feel to heavy on it. The only issue I have with this towel is that it is not as absorbent as I need it to be. If I had fine to normal hair, I would probably give this product 5 stars. However, I have a lot of thick, curly hair that sops up water like a sponge so I need a little more absorbency than this towel provides. Overall, I would say to give this towel a try. There's a reason why it has got so many good reviews."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel is very absorbant and soaks up water in a jiffy.  The towel is big enough to wrap around very long hair and is shaped longer lengthwise to make a turbin if desired.  Hair dries much quicker with the use of this towel.  I see only one drawback, and that is the towel is sort of smooth and a little bit slippery, which takes some practice to get it to stay on your head.  This is the only towel I reach for now after washing my hair and makes for less drying time with the hair dryer. Worth the price and a good investment for those of us with longer hair."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've always had fine, straight hair. In the 80s, I used perms to help, but I didn't want to fry my hair the rest of my life, so I looked for alternatives.I went through all kinds of styling tools fromRevlon RV261 20-Roller Ionic Professional HairsettertoConair CD103JCS Satin Finish 1-1/2-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron, and then some...even hair products like Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray Extreme 7 oz..I finally stumbled across this triple-barrel iron. While it takes much longer to style my hair, it doesn't fall flat after only a few hours...in fact, I've had my waves last overnight.I would not recommend it to someone who is in a hurry, or anyone with shoulder-length or shorter hair...if you don't have long hair, using this iron will make you look ridiculous."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Okay, I observed my wife and my brother use this product upon the effusive recommendation of my sister-in-law.My sister-in-law and my wife have basically perfect skin, rarely a pimple ever forms for them.  My brother also uses this product to great effect as well, which I have observed over the past year.  My wife uses this as a routine facial cleanser, then she applies moisturizer after she's done.  She does not get irritated skin.Personally, I think a lot of commercial cosmetic products are super expensive, over rated items that take advantage of the \"newest fad\". -- Okay, off the soapbox.  This particular Neutrogena product seems to be different."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I want to know what all the hype is about...it certainly is not a bad cleanser at all. In fact, it is pretty awesome! Usually (with panoxyl(sp?)at least) benzoyl peroxide - the main acne fighter in this product - dries me out and irritated my skin. So, its gentle on the BP sensitive. Also, (I don't like it but) it does have menthol which gives the \"wake up\" cooling sensation. I suppose I'm not being fair as I haven't tried it as a mask yet, but the product doesn't seem to be that great on my acne (which is mainly stubborn blackheads and some whiteheads). It does an okay job of preventing new formations, but its not touching what I already have. That is why I went to try the Oil Free Grapefruit cleanser. BAD IDEA. Compared to THAT hot mess, this is a gem!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Now that I'm over 50, I can't believe I still get acne.  I found this product on a whim and use it 3-4 times a week.  It's a thick white cooling gel that you can wash off immediately or wait and use it like a mask.  I can't believe that it has cleared up my skin and tightened up pores.  I truly wish I had this as a teenager.  I've never had a problem with it over-drying.  It's not expensive either when you consider that the better your skin looks, the better you feel.  Great stuff!  Walgreens and most drug stores carry this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a great idea and useful for anyone who prefers to use Benzoyl Peroxide in a wash instead of a cream. I like using this once every few weeks to kill the bacteria that can cause blackheads. It is a rich, creamy clay-like mask that instantly dissolves when water is applied. You can apply this before getting in the shower and it easily rinses away.As the product penetrates into your pores, you feel a cooling sensation. This is also a wonderful product to use on large areas of your body, like your back in the summer, etc. If warm weather makes you break out, try this product a few times a week and I think you will see a difference in the clearness of your skin.It is rather drying, so you might want to use a more intense moisturizer on the day you use this product.3.5% Benzoyl PeroxideAlso look for Biore Deep Cleansing Pore StripsClean & Clear concealing treatment stick~The Rebecca Review"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I like these pads and use them in the morning on days when my skin feels and looks dull. One side is is the exfoliating side and the other is smooth. There is plenty of cleanser on each pad so it gets nice and frothy. I wouldn't use these daily as it is not a good idea to exfoliate your face every day but instead once a week. It would be wasteful to use the pads daily if you are using the soft side as you can just Aveeno cleanser and wash using your hands or a wash cloth. This would not only be better for the environment as you are wasting less but also more cost effective. As good as it might feel to scrub your face each morning, the long-term effect could be an increase in breakouts or make breakouts worse as they don't get a chance to heal. I liked the product, just not for daily use."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought these for the mild acne on my chin and for convenience sake I mean, cleanser and exfoliater in one pad, plus great reviews AND a decent price, sounded great. Well, I used these at night for one week and these evil little pads ruined my face. I had and still have little red bumps all over my forehead and cheeks like my skin was burned off! I haven't used the pads in 2 days now, but my skin is still very dry, even peeling in some spots and the bumps are still there. Oh and my acne is still there too.No, I haven't changed anything else in my skincare routine either.I've NEVER had skin problems before, besides the above mentioned mild acne on my chin, so seeing red bumps all over my face was a little frightening. Hopefully they'll go away soon..I like Aveeno, I really do, so this is very disappointing, if I could give this zero stars I would."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "With my adult acne I have to pamper my skin or it gets too dry.  I love this face wash because my skin feels amazingly clean and SUPER soft and moisturized after washing.  It almost feels as if I have already put my moisturizer on and it does not leave it with a tight feeling.  When I am having hormonal breakouts I have to attack my problen skin with several different products and techniques.  This is a frontline weapon for use several times a day.As a middle-ages woman I look for products that are fierce on blemishes, but gentle to my skin underneath.  This satisfies."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The entire Aveeno Clear Complexion line is amazing. This moisturizer in particular is amazing, and I usually can never find it in stores which is why I strictly have to order it on Amazon - which I am not complaining about! This order always arrives literally 2 days after I buy it, and I am in love with how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. I have very sensitive skin with some oily spots and acne..and this cream is perfect after washing my face in the morning and at night. What I love best about this product is that it doesn't make my face more oily, and it keeps my skin feeling refreshed even during the summer. Love it!"}

{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the first BB cream bottle i have bought and I like it. When I picked it up at the store, I tried on this Aveeno one on one side of my face and the Revlon Photoready BB cream on my other cheek. I believe the Revlon offered a bit more coverage but it also looked and felt a bit more heavy on my face (and heavy makeup isn't really too practical for me). I would recommend the Aveeno BB cream if you are not looking for too much coverage, a more natural look with some good SPF 30. It looks good on my face all day and so far I've kept it on for up to 12 hours straight.Like someone had mentioned before, yes, I did notice my fingers were covered with tiny specks of glitter after applying this bb cream but its barely noticeable on your face so that was nice to see and i noticed it really did help even out my skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been trying to develop a skin care routine and was looking for a good moisturizer.  I have oily acne prone skin and this made my skin burn and break out even worse.  My face is red and dry now because of this.  Cystic acne is not fun to deal with and this brought out too many cysts around my chin and cheeks.  My face was doing great, clearing up before this.  Waste of my money, but I guess it's all about trial and error.  I take my time when adding a new product to my skincare routine so that I know if its going to break me out or not,"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I hate lotions because it makea me feel like i have something on my face and some will make me break out as well.  Nothing I found made my face feel clean and refreshed.I have tried various different types (both expensive name brands and not so expensive ones from drug stores and other retail) and hadn't found one I like.However, i found aveeno face scrub wash worked really well with my skin, and decided to give this one a try.I can say, I have finally found something that i can wear without the weight or the break out.  I think i will be using this for a long time.i'm soooooo glad to have found this lotion.It makes me feel refreshed without all the weight nor the breakout."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought these and they come with 28 pads. The formula is great - acne spots that usually took months to clear up, now clear up within a couple of weeks. It really does help to even skin tone and is gentle on the skin. It keeps my skin smooth and seems to be improving the overall look of it. However, I'm not the only one in my home that uses acne cleansers and these pads only lasted 2 weeks between my fianc&eacute; and myself. So my only complaint is that you have to get them more frequently than other cleansers. I ended up getting the Clear Complexion foaming cleanser - same formula and will last longer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product not only smells amazing but lathers up extremely well.  I do not need any water to get the lather going and it soaps up my face nicely.  The disks are a generous size and if you were frugal you certainly could snip them in half and get double duty out of them.  I feel that I am more apt to cleaning my face at night when I have the cleaner ready for me.  One side of the disk is smooth and the other side has more of a texture to allow deeper penetration of your pours. My face looks bright and clean!  I was on facetime with my mom and she had commented out radiant my skin looked as I just got done washing it.  I will be picking up more of these when I run out!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this because it has soy in it and I know soy helps to even the skin tone. I thought the salicylic acid it contains would help to keep my skin clear as well. But this made my already oily skin appear to be greasy. By mid day if I ran my hand over my face I could see the oil on my hand as well. There is also only 0.5% salicylic acid which really does nothing to control chronic acne.The good points are that the pads are nice and large and it smells nice and lathers up nicely. In fact I continued to use it b/c I liked the way the lather felt on my face, but it just got to be too oily for me so I stopped. If you have dry skin, I recommend it, but I do not recommend it for people who have oily skin and chronic or severe acne."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I usually break out in the summer. I sweat a lot while gardening and my pores get clogged, especially on my forehead. Since, I've change my skin regimen, my breakouts have been minimal to nil. Here is what I do. 1) Wash my face morning and night, 2) Use witch hazel pads, and then 3) finish off with this moisturizer. I always thought washing my skin too much would dry it out, but it's just fine, and most importantly - pimple-free. Since I am now using this moisturizer as part of my regimen, I guess I will give this product some of the credit. I just re-ordered."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I LOVE this stuff. Too bad I just discovered this last week & it has been DISCONTINUED! I'm so upset!I used it this morning & then said to my husband \"How does my face look?\" He replied \"like you have on make-up\"  I don't wear ANY makeup so my complexion is important to me. This does the trick! Makes my face so clear and radiant. I've used it for a week on my combination skin at it's the best cleanser I have ever used.I will have to buy this where ever I spot it because I can't stand the thought of being without it forever. I just found another bottle today so maybe when I'm all out I'll giveAveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser, 6.7 Ouncea try."}

I've never used many products to improve my skin, but I will definitely keep this in my stash now!I never had problem skin in high school, but once I hit college I just started having a lot of breakouts from high stress and poor eating habits. I finally found a daily facial wash that worked well and didn't completely dry out my skin (causing me to break out more!), but the combination of new skin wash and this moisturizer are what ultimately cleared up my skin.No more redness, and I've had one breakout in the last two weeks since using this. It really makes your skin look even and clear!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I fortunately grew out of the annoying pimple phase, but I still have combination skin with a T-zone that becomes oily by early afternoon. This product, in conjunction with the Olay Complete Daily Defense All Day Moisturizer with SPF 30, has FINALLY succeeded in minimizing my oiliness. I do still have dry areas, for which the moisturizer works well. I occasionally get a pimple, and I noticed that the frequency has decreased since I started using this cleanser.One star off for minor reasons: 1) I personally didn't mind this, but my fiance didn't like that the cleanser is so light and foamy. He prefers something more substantial in texture so that he knows he's really getting clean; and 2) after a while, the pump got sticky and lost its spring. Now, after pushing down, I have to manually lift up the nozzle so that I can pump again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Helps with my breakouts!!! But not as a daily regimen!!! As it did tighten my skin and gave me dry skin around my mouth when I used it twice daily for a 3 days straight! However using this every other day with the body shop tea tree oil foaming cleanser and the aveeno daily detoxifying scrub, has worked wonders for my acne prone skin!When my acne is at its peak I use the aveeno clear foaming cleanser, the next day I use the aveeno daily detoxifying scrub and the day after the body shop tea tree oil foaming cleanser. I normally just wash my face in the shower with neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser every other day.I wear makeup 4 days out of the week for work and wash it off with this or the body shop tea tree oil foaming as soon as I get home. My skin has been flawless and would recommend my combination of products for anyone who has combo/sensitive skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was looking for a travel hairdryer to take on a trip to Europe. I chose this one because it has dual voltage, is foldable, and is available through Amazon Prime for quick shipping. It is rather bulky, but I suppose if it were smaller it wouldn't have the power and other nice features like the speed settings and \"cool\" button. It performed perfectly on the trip (with the addition of a tiny outlet adapter) and is comfortable to hold. Now I keep it in my gym bag.  Overall, I recommend this if you want a somewhat more compact but still powerful dryer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For over 20 years, the Conair has been the only brand of hair dryer I've purchased.  I've never experienced any kind of problem with a Conair dryer, and I've only replaced them when I've wanted something smaller or with new features.This little travel dryer is the best Conair hair dryer I've tried yet!  Despite the small size--which tucks easily into your suitcase--the 1875 watts provide a strong, intense stream of air, helping me to have less drying time while traveling.  In fact, this product works so well that I also recommend it for home use; the folding handle would allow it to fit into even the smallest vanity drawer.  Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was hoping this would eliminate the need to blow-with-a-brush my thick short hair.  But unfortunately it  doesn't provide enough control to replace that.  It's good for touch ups, but when I used it on my hair that I didn't blow dry, it didn't give enough control.  My hair stayed frizzy and lost its shape quickly.  I don't like using a curling iron, but with the clip it does provide more control and has more effect on the hair.Based on the other reviews it does replace that process for many users, but didn't for me.Pros:Easy to useAdjustable heat settingsGood for touch upsProbably not damaging to hairCons:Doesn't provide enough control for thick, coarse hairDoes not seal the cuticle, hence doesn't stop the frizzies"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Great hot brush! My sister bought 1 of these years ago and then it died a few weeks ago. She looked everywhere and couldn't find one like it. I looked on Amazon and there it was! Needless to say I bought her 2 of them, 1 to take home and 1 to leave at my home. She was so surprised and both work perfectly. It's so nice to be able to find something like this at Amazon. If you use this size brush for curling this is a great little tool. Highly recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I ordered the 3/4-inch hot brush for myself and after experimenting a few times, liked it so much I ordered the 1-1/4-inch as a gift for a friend and she is very happy with it.

The delivery was fast, the items were packaged well, and the hot brush works according to description."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I got this because I have fine, wavy brunette hair that often frizzes.- I wanted something that will reduce fly-away hair- I wanted a way to style my hair super fast between washes and still look good.This does the trick.- Variable heat - great.- Tip stays cool so you can actually handle both ends.- Nibs on the brush stay cool while the barrel heats up so I don't burn my skull Ever anymore.- Super fast warm-up time.- I can use it to straighten my hair by just drawing the brush through my hair straight- I can use it to curl my hair by turning it while the hair is wrapped around it.It does risk tangling if you wrap long hair around it more than twice, so I try not to do that.All in all, I love this puppy.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the greatest thing since sliced bread...well no not really. I read so many rave reviews on this. When I first received it I was disappointed. I tried to curl my hair with it to no avail. I couldn't understand why so many hyped reviews. I was going to return this but then I read it takes practice. I practiced and I learned I had been using it all wrong. Now I have gotten the hang of it and am only keeping my old clamp curling iron as back up in case something happens to this one. Really awesome..the reason for only 4 stars is because your hair can get tangled pretty easy and when it does, it's not too pleasant. Also the cord is very short, can't move to my normal \"getting ready\" spot, need to stay close to the outlet."}

It disappeared somewhere along the way, and I have wished I could find another one for a few years now.  But I never found one in any store.  Then I came across this one on Amazon.  I love it.  It accomplishes the same thing as the old one, which is to smooth out my hair after I have blow-dried it without adding unwanted curl.  Of course, you can use it to curl your hair if that's your pleasure."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I like this brush as an alternative to curling irons and wands used on my slightly longer than shoulder-length hair.  I had one in highschool but I didn't like it.  I though 30 years later, the quality would have improved.  I was right.  You have to take the hair in smaller sections and the curl is not defined like with an iron. It's soft, flowy curls.  However, within hours, my hair was flat.  So, unless your hair is shorter and curlier, I would not recommend if you want real curls that last.  It is NOT good for fine or thin hair."}

I didn't even use the highest heat setting! I also used this on my son's 7&#34; afro, which is VERY CURL RESISTANT when using flat irons, and it straightened HIS hair (I do this so I can trim his hair since he doesn't trust barbers after a bad experience cutting his &#34;bodacious fro&#34; lol). I have lots of heated irons, but this did straighten AND curl my hair very well. Therefore, I have NO hesitation recommending this product!"}

I still have to use the big curling iron for the small shorter pieces of hair around my face.  They almost give that look that the hairdresser can get using the big velcro rollers and then have you sitting under the hairdryer.....Very pleased!"}

I CAN'T RETURN IT BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT'S HAZARDOUS. I will, however, enjoy the conditioner that was included and might consider re-purposing the developer. Just not with a caramel color.

I am disappointed with how dark and how red the color is.  The grey covered very well (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1).  I don't really like the formulation -- the gel colorant is quite drippy. I also like that it only takes 25 minutes to process.  I might try it again if I had confidence about the color choice."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My hair get's a REALLY ugly red in the summer when I'm in the Sun. I have to use an Ash Color This toned it down a lot. I had to do my end's for 10 minutes and then all over for another 15-20. My hair tend's to not dye evenly if I don't do it this way. Even when I pay A TON of Money at Salon's. I'm very happy with this color. I have been dying my hair for 30 year's and  have tried almost every color. I used to use Feria, but I'm sold on this now!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have dark reddish/brown hair and wanted to dye it blonde for a change. I chose this brand because the before photo on the box appeared to match my hair the closest and the after photo best matched the shade of blonde I wanted to be. I applied this brand to my hair and it did absolutely nothing. It says on the directions to leave it in for 25 minutes. I wasn't noticing a change so I left it in for an hour. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the conditioner smells amazing and it left my hair feeling very soft. Too bad the dye doesn't work."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "You see so many products that claim to be the 1 that makes your skin flawless, but nothing compares to Olay.I have been using this exact product for almost 3 years and my skin glows, My skin is healthy and no wrinkles at the age of 40.I know good jeans have a lot to do with it and my family does have good jeans but most my family had some wrinkles by time they hit 40 & I have nothing and I know it Is from the use of Olay 2x's a day (morning & night). I highly recommend this product to everyone. I get compliments all the time on my skin glowing and also everyone thinks I am in my mid 20's. IT WORKS!!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Some years ago, I saw that an independent testing lab had rated Olay as the most effective at achieving visible results and had bested competing products costing multiple times as much.  I bought some and was very pleased with the results. This Total Effects Night Treatment was a new product that I wanted to try, and it's difficult not to sound like a contrived television commercial at how impressed I am.  It's nothing short of remarkable how smooth and nourishing it is to my middle age skin, with no irritation or oiliness.  After finishing my first jar and not being able to find it at my local grocery store, I opted for a heavily advertised competing product that they did have. Big mistake and I actually had to return it after just a few days for the disturbing irritation it caused to my skin. Everyone's skin, of course, has it's own sensitivity and chemistry, but for me at least, I can't recommend this highly enough. It does what it says and at a very reasonable price."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using Olay products for a number of years, and at 67 years of age, I don't have any wrinkles on my face, neck, or upper chest. This could, of course, be due to heredity because my 94 year old mother doesn't have much in wrinkles either. There is really no way to know for sure, but I do like the feel of this product on my skin. When I use it, my skin feels soft and moisturized, and not greasy as it does with some other products. I will continue to use this and other Olay products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm assuming that what they tell you is true and you need to occasionally run sandpaper over your face to strip a small layer off. In that case, I'd recommend this to do it.I only use this once a week or once a fortnight. But when I feel particularly that there's too much skin on my face and I need to strip a layer off I use this. The good thing about it is that it cleans quite well yet does not leave your skin dry. It smells nice without being overpowering. And I only use it before sleep and never after shaving because I think that shaving already strips a layer off your skin.So, cleans nicely, does not leave the skin raw, I recommend it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "After even a quick wash, my hair feels too squeaky and crispy. On one hand it can be an indication of the shampoo doing a good job cleansing the hair. On the other hand, it feels like it washes off all the oils that my scalp needs. When I dry my hair it looks too lifeless and just sticks up because it lacks any weight... I've never had my hair thinner. And yes, I use the conditioner of the same brand after every wash, but it doesn't help."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Amazing sunscreen! I can't use any other after getting this. Even better testimonial is my husband will actually use this too, and he is one to HATE anything creamy. A very small amount of this goes a very long way. It works too, I burn so easy and for an average day (4 to 5 hours) of being in direct sun outside swimming, I have never needed to re-apply. Never had any sunburn, or even the feeling of being sunburned that most sunscreens leave me with. This really works. It has a nice clean smell too, so great for men or women. Non-greasy, it is a little more massaging to rub it in than most of the suncreens I've used in the past, but nothing to difficult at all. Just rub it in and enjoy your day. You will smell fresh and clean the whole time too. Great stuff!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My son got tanned despite of using this daily. He had golf lessons 3 times a week in the mornings! and only for one hour! he came back home darker after each lesson. My husband got a tan too but didn't burn. I have to admit, we are currently in South America, perhaps it will work better in Northern Hemisphere.  It's not easy to spread, leaves white cast, you have to rub it a lot to get rid of whiteness, and hairy fuzzy men, forget it!!! We tried Australian gold brand (easier to spread but stinks to high heavens), and no difference in protection."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Over the past year, I had gel french nails done bi-weekly in a salon, unfortunately, after about 1 year, my nails were burning, which I know is due to filing/sanding. I did tons of research and came up with a non-salon regimen that works for me. I use Hoofmaker Hand and Nail lotion, Nailtiques Plus 2, Zeva Crystal file, and Zeva Nail Brite. Finally, I use 2 different cuticle cream a few x's per day - Barielle cuticle cream. Barielle's cuticle cream dries nicely. All of this together has made a huge difference. I never thought it was possible to have natural nails that actually looked nice."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have no complaints about these hot rollers, I love them. This is the third set I bought. I bought one for myself and my sister and best friend kept borrowing it so I bought them each one for Birthdays and Christmas. I will never use a curling iron again! These heat up in 30 seconds and have enough heat to curl my hair in 30mins with really tight curls which my hair is down almost to my butt so it takes forever to curl with a curling iron. I would rate this item 400 stars if I could I love it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought these awhile back and wrote a favorable review on them, but they seem to have become useless somehow. I used to get nice bouncy curls, but now the rollers don't hold heat and when I unroll my hair it comes out frizzy, fuzzy and kinky. I was shocked because they used to work so well. I've taken good care of my set, I never leave it on or forget to turn it off for long periods, and I can't imagine it wearing out so quickly, especially because I only use them maybe twice a week. I will not be buying another set, I think I'm going with the BabyLiss hot rollers this time.P.S. They only come with three clips."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love this hair curler set. I have purchased two of them now, one for each daughter. Both have long, thick hair and we find that it does an excellent job of providing just the right amount of curl for those occasions when you need it. It takes just a few minutes to heat up and the soft velvet lining on the rods make it less damaging to hair.The only thing I always hate is the clips! Even though there is a small case to hold them, sometimes they get lost!  Replacement clip sets would be much appreciated. I think the curler set contains just the right number of each size of roller -- even better though would be to have two ore large ones!!Recommended."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very fine hair that is determined to be straight.  I had a set of curlers that were starting to go out on me (they took 45 minutes to heat up and did not hold the curl).  I recently decided to replace it with the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Hot Rollers, since I was interested in curlers that would heat up quickly.  They heat up just as quickly as they say.  They are incredibly hot and do a great job of putting in a curl that holds.  Like I said, I have the kind of hair that wants desperately to be straight, and my curl stays all day with these curlers.  They are fairly hot on the edges, but I have yet to find any curlers that won't be challenging to handle for more than a minute.  I would definitely recommend these to any of my friends."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I rarely ever return items because it's such a hassle. But this, is being returned immediately. The idea is actually very good- it has a side heater to heat up the clips as well as the rollers, a feature I've never seen before. However, the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair. No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds. Even when I stayed completely still (very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers) they would still fall out. They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The scent is so well done, I could smell it while it's in the wrapper! It should be a room fragrance as well until you're ready to wash with it lol....I had the lavendar and jasmine and it's the first time I've ever seen  a CLEAR NATURAL SOAP. I thought that was fascinating. The scents are awesome and my fiance used the lavender soap for his dry skin since he tends to get rashes when he scratches himself. and he says he likes it so far. Worth the cheap price so give it a shot!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The thought of cutting my hair is beyond consideration but two little Yorkies just love this set.  The main reason is that is is quiet and effective.  Those, to me, are the operative words:  quiet and effective.  When you turn the clipper on it makes a humming noise instead of a loud \"I'm going to get you\" sound.  Then when you start cutting small animal hair you actually cut it without pulling or leaving gapping holes in their fur.  Maintenance is easy and with all the tools you could almost go into business but I'll pass on that.  Additionally, you have the Wahl brand and that makes a positive difference."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "i have tried a lot of sulfur masks ever since i started to get acne at 11 yrs old (i know sad lol) and this is by far one that i can see improvements on the size of my acne in days. i use it as a mask and leave it on for a while or as a spot treatment an leave it overnight and i get great results. the price is unbeatable and its smell minty (like spearmint gum or toothpaste. there is little tightening feel (unless you put a thick layer) and very little tingling sensation. once i rinse off, my skin doesn't feel dry (like the ddf sulfur mask) and i put a serum and moisturizer and my skin feels good.by no means does it completely  get rid of my acne, but it has made it more manageable and i wear less makeup because of it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It helped made my pores smaller and make my face looked more clean. The mask does really dries out my face so I would have to use a good amount of moisturizer after. Another con is that it leaves a weird smell. It lingers for a couple of hours but you get use to it. I would recommend this mask to anyone who wants to have a clearer face and would use it maybe once per 1-2 weeks depending on how dry your skin easily gets. My skin is combination and once per week is enough for me. I don't really use it frequently as before now because it takes a while to squeeze it out of the tube and slather over your face evenly."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this mask for about 30 years now ..... If you have acne breakout this is a good product and it doesn't cost a fortune...I have tried other masks but keep coming back to this one.......my skin is no longer problematic ....my friends now  cant believe how great my skin is ......when I tell them my ups and downs with hormonal acne...thanks !!! queen helene!!!  I have no scars !!! I just found out amazon carries this product at such a great price!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Ive been using this since like the 6th grade (Im 26 now). I use it probably 1-2x a week and its amazing. It helps minimize pores and kill current pimples. Its very easy to use. I just put it on, go do the dishwasher or something and then take a shower and get it off. I take it off in the shower with water/soap and then follow it up with the mint julep facial scrub. When I get out of the shower my face is smooth, pores are reduced and my skin is glowing.The bottle lasts forever too!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "When I first put it on there was a strong peppermint smell, and a really tingly almost stinging feeling. That kind of scared me. But it went away as the stuff dried. I think it takes more than 15 minutes, but thats ok because you can multitask. Very green in color, I looked as scared as I was at first!I took it off using two washclothes. The first to get the majority off of my face, and the second to make sure residue was off. Pretty easy.this stuff is cheap, and the results really only last a day. But for the price it is great! My skin felt tighter and firm, while not drying it out too much and leaving it soft.I don't really know if it dries out acne like it says, I only had twp spots and didn't notice a difference. But oh well."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "While I was waiting to get this product me (being impatient) went out and bought a knock off brand from a local store. I'd have to say so far the knock off brand worked better than this. I did not feel the face tightening effect other viewers had described with this product (though i did with the store bought brand) and this has caused me to break out in the most unpleasent of places on my face. Weird places like in between my eyes and eyebrows and forehead. Perhaps I will try again in the future but I am dissapointed in this product right now."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this item not really knowing mud about it, just read up whatever it said on the tube. I decided to go ahead andbuy it.I LOVE LOVE LOVE this item. It feels very refreshing and cooling on the skin. Has a peppermint scent. However, not an overpowering one.Makes my face feel very smooth and clean after I take this off. I use this about 1-2 a week and i really enjoy it. Works wonderfully for me.I recommend this item if your looking for a refreshing masque, that will clean your face, and make you feel very refreshed!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this at a local store for just 3 dollars,and I wanted to know what the hype was about.Typically, I use more expensive products on my face,believing that they will do the trick, but I was proven wrong.Despite the low price of this, it works very well, and there is agenerous amount of it in the package. I recommend it, it stingsa bit, but really does what it says! I do also feel a bit of tightnessfrom it, but other than that, this is a great product and has a priceyou really can't beat."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product is as close to useless as it can get.  It's a waste of money.  First of all, it falsely advertises as  it doesn't \"peel\" anything.  Normally with a face masque of any kind, you will see a remarkable instant \"glowing\" or \"brightening\" of your skin because it deep cleans.  This product is too thin to be of any benefit.  It does not deep clean and the slightest bit of perspiration will immediately start to dissolve it.  After one tube, I would never buy it again and I do not recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn't remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite. This product is messy to apply and thick, and it takes a long time to dry and I don't see a difference in my face when I take it off. I left it in the draw with all the other products I don't really use because they do nothing special. I mean really!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "When I have the time, I usually like to use a dry clay mask that I mix with water or vinegar. If I'm pressed for time, I reach for Queen Helene Masque Mud Pack, and it really is good as a fast fix to get out the impurities caused by cosmetics, excess facial oils and the general crud that floats around in the air. If you don't currently use a clay mask, this is a great one to start with. You will instantly see a difference when you apply fresh make-up. Very good!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love this mask. I have been using the expensive masks since I was early 20s. But this one is much better than the ones cost me over $80. My friends told me that I look younger than my younger sister now. hehe... I'm using it once a week, my skin tone is more even now and skin feels tighter too. I have been using the rose water as toner, they are great combination. Maybe the rose water is doing a good job too, I love them both."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used to have extremely dry skin and everyone noticed, it was awful, i hated it so much. Finally a friend who also used to have dry skin recommended this product to me. She has a huge bottle of it at home and during the day she brings a small sample sized bottle of it with her in her purse and she let me try it. That afternoon i drove to the store to buy it.How did i live without it.My skin is no longer dry, its soft and i am so happy. Everyone now asks me now what product i used to get such soft skin. It Is Honestly Silk In A Bottle!!!! I highly recommend this product!!! If you try this product you wont regret it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I ordered this to try because most body washes irritate and dry  my super-sensitive skin.  This does the trick, it is very mild, and cleans without leaving your skin with that tight stripped feeling.  Nice, effective product at a good price. It is not heavily scented or as fancy as some other body washes, no bright colors or gritty beads, just a light natural scent (no added fragrance, which is  a big deal because fragrance is a major cause of allergic reactions) and an effective gentle body wash.  I highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had horrible eczema on both arms for over a week. It was bad my skin burned in some spots. I went to the Dermatologist and was given a prescription cream. The cream did NOTHING. After another week of this crud on my arms I spotted the Aveeno I had in my cupboard. I thought, \"Why not?\" I applied it after showering at night twice and on day three ALL of the dry spots were gone. I love Aveeno products and no I was not paid to write this. I am a life fan now."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My husband & I do not like moisturizers with perfumes.  We both like this one very much because it absorbs into the skin and doesn't smell like a perfume counter.  We use it every day and before going to sleep.  This is a heavier version of the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion; if you like a lighter lotion, you may want to try that one.  This lotion has shea butter which is super rich & moisturizing.  It will feel a little greasy when you first put it on but it absorbs quickly & becomes less greasy.It also works wonders on dry heels, elbows & chapped hands.  And it does this without perfumey stink!Lighter Version:Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I fully expected to like this.  It does make my skin softer, but it creates a sort of film on my skin that then will sort of get gritty and rub off if I rub my hands.  It's slightly waxy. It also seems to rub off on my clothing, which I can see if I'm wearing black or dark blue.  I wonder if it might actually be the \"oat kernel flour\" that does this? Colloidal oatmeal is a powder.  I'm not going to throw it out, but I'm not going to buy it again either. I bought this at a local drug store so I can't comment on what others have said about the product having been opened or used, except to say that I don't remember it being sealed in any way."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the first winter of my life that I have had my skin dry up so fast like it has been. I concocted a mixture of Shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter oil, vitamin e oil and have been putting it on my skin just for my skin to suck it in and be dry and itchy in about 2 hours. Yesterday, I bought this product, along with the matching body wash. No dryness, no itching.  I slept without scratching all freaking night for the first night in a month or so. What a relief! This is my new wintertime lotion."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have suffered bad skin allergies and eczema for years.  I only use aveeno to soap my body with.  I don't think I am allergic to scented soap, but the benefit I know I get from Aveeno is that it keeps my skin moist (but not greasy), which is really important if you have eczema.  I also use Aveeno's eczema lotion to pair with this soap and together they keep my flare ups at bay.  I would give this a sixth star if possible because of the price here on Amazon.  It is nearly half the amount than the regular store!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have really dry skin. It runs in my family and I've had to deal with it all my life, so I have experience with all kinds of lotion since I was a little girl. For dry skin I've mainly stuck with oil-based deep moisturizers. I tried \"water-based\"-feeling type lotions before and they were always so lightweight. But then I discovered Aveeno moisturizing line, specifically the 18-hour and now it's all I use. I have need for nothing else. What I like most about it is that it PENETRATES and HYDRATES from within (rather than sits on top of skin acting as a sealant). It hydrates within and how long it lasts (staying power) is the best I've seen. Also, I'm NO LONGER left with an oily or \"smudgy\" body (I'd leave smudges everywhere I touched due to the heavier, less effective lotions of the past). I feel deeply moisturized and non-oily - can't beat it. I'm a customer for life!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have to say that I'm really bad at using hand lotion.  I never remember to put in on, even in the winter.  The only time I remember is after my hands are already red and cracked.  I came across this stuff a couple winters ago when my hands were in really bad shape.  After the first use, my hands were moisturized and no longer cracked.  What is also great about it is that it lasts through handwashing.  I use this once in the morning and it usually lasts the entire day. Great, great, great product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very dry skin after chemo and have tried so many OTC and even expensive prescriptions but this has worked the best for me.  It soaks in and I don't scratch.  I don't feel like I've got lotion layering on my skin.  I'm a picture so if I feel a bump or scratch or rub and it moves I unintentionally dig and this stuff has soaked in, a rarely scratch and then its usually about time for the evening application.  When I apply at night, even with the mild hot flashes it keeps me from scratching, a nice lubricating product that doesn't layer on top, it really soaks in.noknots"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I tried this. It didn't work for me but it might work for others based on all the good reviews it has on amazon. It's probably only for certain hair types (maybe shorter and less oily hair). My hair gets oily quickly and when I use this the day after a shower, It doesn't feel clean. It leaves a sticky feeling in my hair and it still looks oily. It also weighs my hair down. The only plus is it smells nice. Powder dry shampoo may be another option, but I haven't tried that one yet."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "When our daughter had surgery last fall, she wasn't able to stand long enough to shower, and had gauze dressings that couldn't get wet.  I had been sponge bathing her, but her long hair desperately needed washing.  I picked up a bottle of this no-rinse shampoo at Walmart.I was able to massage it through her hair and then towel it dry, and get a comb through her matted hair.  It did remove most of the oil and made her hair smell better, although of course it wasn't as nice as an actual shampoo.  However, when you don't have a choice about being able to shower, this is a good option.  She felt better just having her hair somewhat clean and brushed after a week of lying there.I would recommend this if you are caring for someone who can't take a regular shower or bath, but wouldn't recommend it for a way to skip shampooing if you're able to shampoo."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried allot of these types of products (should mention I'm a hair stylist & can get many hair products at half price or less) & even the so called \"expensive brand named ones\" to me I hated. They all stunk & looked like I dumped a bottle of baby powder all over my hair. With allot of good reviews on here I decided to give this one a whirl. Loved it! Yes, you do have to lather it until your hair is pretty wet but it WORKS (for me anyways) & I have very fine/kind of oily hair. Sure beats washing it every day & styling it over & over each day. Not to mention doing that every day really drys out & damages it. This doesn't. I recommend it for sure."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I brought this camping and both guys and gals used this.  It smells fresh, like you've taken a shower with regular shampoo, feels refreshing when going on.  The directions say to soak your hair, massage it in and then towel dry. I have a lot of hair but still have a decent amount left (it was used by 5 adults).  It does make your hair look smooth and it does make if feel like there's product in your hair (like gel) but it's much, much better than going without a shower."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This lipstick really stays on for a full day and probably longer if you don't take it off at night before sleeping. It also stays on coffee cups, spoons, etc. through a dishwasher cycle so check carefully when unloading the dishes to be put away or your house will look like a bad restaurant. I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover to remove it at night and I have read that some people use baby oil. If you want to go all day without worrying about your lipstick, this is the product for you. Sometimes I wonder what exactly is in it to make it stay on so long, but it's probably better for my peace of mind not to know."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For a lip gloss, the pigmentation and staying power is pretty great. Once it dries, it stays put and doesn't feel sticky (no more hair sticking to your lips on a windy day!).Just a head's up: it seems to form a plasticky coating on your lips that tends to peel/flake off, instead of just fade away. If I gently rub my lips together when wearing this, it literally forms little clumps that flake off. I wouldn't recommend this for people who tend to have dry lips. If that doesn't bother you, go ahead and give this a try."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I usually use the Q10 w/o the spf and wanted to try the one with spf because I'm starting retin-A but they didn't sell it.. so I decided to give this one a try. I have pretty dry skin. It gets pretty flaky in the winter time so I need something that will moisturize deeply. This face moisturizer penetrates my skin to where it isn't flaky anymore yet it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy/oily. I can wear it under make up and my skin looks super smooth all day. I'm also prone to ocassional break outs and haven't had any problems with them so I like this product a lot. Fragrance free is also a plus."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product feels okay on the skin but leaves a highly visible white film on the skin.  I'm not sure if it is apparent on other races but it is very noticeable on African American skin tones. It looks like I've applied cheap foundation shades too light on my face.I cannot wear it outdoors in front of people during the day (and I'm cheap! :) ) so I use it as my night time moisturizer before bed. Imagine using an SPF moisturizer only to bed...Will not repurchase once I've used it all."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a great value and offers great protection.I have very fair skin and I'm often frustrated when selecting moisturizers... anything above SPF 15 is either expensive or just regular, old sunblock.And then I found this! It's reasonably priced and offers SPF 30. Even more importantly, it's &#34;broad spectrum&#34;, which means it protects from rays that cause sunburn AND wrinkles and cancer. (Although BEWARE: Eucerin's similarly packaged body lotion with SPF 15 is NOT broad spectrum - BAD EUCERIN!)Previously, I used Olay, but couldn't find a higher SPF.I have VERY sensitive skin. Derms always recommend Cetaphil at the bargain end for skin like mine, and that even gave me a terrible rash. Even around the eye area, I'm able to use this moisturizer with no clogged pores or irritation.It's the best I've tried and I've tried all the usual drugstore suspects. I hope it stays on shelves for a long time!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is my go-to moisturizer. It's light (maybe a little too light for winter if you get really dry skin), and it has 30 spf which many doctors recommend nowadays.  Given the 30 SPF, this is by far the cheapest facial lotion I've seen here or anywhere else.  It absorbs well into my skin, does NOT smell strongly of sunscreen or anything really, and the pump dispenser is pretty good (though if you are a vigorous pumper it will look like something... gross and white... got squirted on you). The little plastic cap is good quality  --- it has never cracked on me like some other bottles. Even after months of use, it seems to treat my acne kindly, which is to say it doesn't really have an effect on it either way. Best of all though, this lotion never stings even if I get it close to my eyes.My only complaint is I wish they made 3oz bottles so I could take this on a plane."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I switch around among the usual suspects--Eucerin, Aveeno, Neutrogena,etc. but this is my favorite. It's truly fragrance free with a high SPF, and a little goes a long way. It spreads nicely over the skin with a smooth feel. I don't notice the so-called white residue some have mentioned--I slather it on and let it dry for a minute or two, and if any excess cream is still visible I then blend it in easily. I haven't used it long enough to notice that my wrinkles are less visible--I don't really believe that anything topical will help anyway, and I'm not about to do anything more drastic, so this lotion is great for me. The price here for two is excellent."}

This 30SPF lotion leaves a white shiny film on my face and the skin looks a little pinker because of this. No, I don't use too much at once, actually not enough (I know that we should use one tablespoon for the face for perfect cover, I use less than a teaspoon). I used other SPF 30 creams and did not have the effect.The pro is that sensitive skin won't react bad. I had no burning or tingling from this product. Just won't use it because I don't want to look white/pink and shiny"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I live in a very sunny desert area, and this lotion has worked great as my daily UV protection.  Does not make your face look greasy, and has no scent, so folks cannot even tell I have it on.  When I used it in a more humid environment, however, it did sweat off into my eyes fairly readily. So not recommended as your primary protection for sports or swimming, and be ready for it to sweat off and sting your eyes in more hot and humid climes.  But for drier areas, works great."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It's okay. It moisturizes. It feels a bit oily but that might just be my skin. It is light which I like. Also, I like the bottle because one pump is exactly how much I need. However, it smells like a sunscreen. Also, It looks and feels like a sunscreen to some extent. It is not a real problem, but I don't especially like it particularly because, like sunscreen, it leaves your face tinted white before it settles it . I'll probably try something different when I'm done with these two bottles. The only good thing about the sunscreen likeness is that it is SPF 30 which is really good, however; I'm not sure whether I should reapply it after 2 hours of being in the sun like most sunscreens or just leave it. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking for a sunscreen."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Overall, it sits on my skin and I wouldn't be able to put makeup over it because it doesn't absorb into my face.  My face ends up looking sweaty even though I haven't broken a sweat!  The product also has a strong chemical smell like a very cheap sunscreen.  It is also drying, which is weird for a moisture lotion.  If you sweat while wearing this, you will get white streaks on your clothing and face.I've kept this bottle for only one reason and that is to use it if I run out of the good stuff and that isn't often.  I guess you get what you pay for.  This is cheap as in price and in quality.  I highly recommendAveeno Smart Essentials Daily Nourishing Moisturizer, 2.5 oz.over this one."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I first read THE PROPHET in college back in the 60's. The book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60's. It had a profound effect on me and became a book I always took with me. After graduation I joined the Peace Corps and during stressful training in country (Liberia) at times of illness and the night before I left, this book gave me great comfort. I read it before I married, just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses. I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future.Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word. I think that we as a nation should read AND learn the lessons here. It is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I discovered The Prophet fifty years ago in college and have read it dozens of times since then.  Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy.  If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it.  It doesn't care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.  Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Anything I've read by Gibran is, in my mind, flawless. This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran's work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is Gibran's most celebrated work and it is so with goodreason.  It is a profound insight and expose into the human characterand the emotions that work within the heart and soul.  Humble words,seared with the heights and depths of love and of pain, this is a life-changing arrangement of words.  If I had to sum the book up in one word, it would be &quot;SUBLIME.&quot; If you're picking up this title, be sure to order Gibran's 'The Beloved' to go along with it. These are books that deserve a worthy and permanent place on your bookshelf."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Intrinsically, this book utilizes a flowing a cleaver way to express the ideological interpretations of the author. While, personally, I found nothing profound in the ideologies expressed in the book, I did find it, simply a pleasure to read. Even with the lack of philosophical epiphany, the style of the book in its fluid manner, the parallel structure of the chapters, and the brevity combined with the larger font in the piece, leave the reader, whether they agree with the philosophies therein or not, in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time. As, really, they probably have not, it really did not waste my time anyway; it only took a little over an hour to read (with breaks)."}

{"label": 5, "raw": "When Gibran was first introduced to me, I had definite doubts that his work would be the ordinary, grab a dictionary sort of read. But when you first open to those sections that apply to you, and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears, well, shock is the only word for it. Yes, the ideals and beliefs that he expresses in 'The Prophet' may not be anything new as far as philosophy is concerned, but the perfect blend of brilliant poetry and this simple philosophy come together to make something that is indeed, unique. I've purchased countless copies to the ones that I know will love and understand his words. And if for nothing else, Kahlil's work can be labeled as truly, a literary work of art."}

What you find in it depends as much on the book as it does on you. It speaks of love, life and people in the most touching way ever. I have it in my handbag at all times. When I first read it, I cried. There is literally something mystical about it. I like to think I took a lot out of it. One of those books you should read again and again and again.."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Since I first read The Prophet when I was a teenager I have had a copy by my side.  It is a gift of such value in comprehending the depth and meaning of this wonderful Life in its beauty of every relationship that engages us.  Be it work, parenting, eating, death or love, Gibran paints word images of such divine and exquisite loveliness that, once read, will change the reader's perspective forever.  It is a book to refer to again and again as life unfolds and offers new opportunities for spiritual growth and awareness.It is a book I have given as a gift to many young people as they grapple with the frustrations and distortions of an often incomprehensible outer world.  It is a book of beautiful truths and a map to our own seeking souls.  I particularly love this edition which includes Gibran's original drawings."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have been reading The Prophet every year for over a decade. Or intending to. It's an incredible read. If I'm having issues in my life, I read the section that relates to my problem and it helps clarify things somewhat. It is a divinely inspired piece of work, and can be read in one setting. There is pretty much nothing that he doesn't cover in the book that can't be related to your own life. I bought the ebook version so I could have easier access. It's a book for everyone."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I first became aware of Kahlil Gibran when I read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Ever since then, I have sought out his books.  The Prophet is my favorite.  Several of the  &quot;poems&quot; or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life.  The  book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others.  There is  barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on-love, marriage,  death and all of our own insecurities and doubts about people and life.  This would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough  time, or just has unanswered questions at a certain point in their lives.  The writing is lucid, insightful, and will be relevant for as long as time  goes on.The drawings add to an already great work.  At my favorite Lebanese  restaurant, I not only found good food-I thankfully found Kahlil Gibran."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Gibran wrote the ultimate way of seeing life and living in it. the importance of each relationship. The book was written to be relatable to every reader, all the subjects are mondain. The availability of this book is a great advantage that I don't think people are aware of. It's an hour long to read, but a lifetime to understand, if you read it you'll remember it in every new life matter or relationship.Buy it and keep it on the shelve for reference, it's an answer to everything. and read it carefully."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My intention here is to comment on the quality of this reading, rather than the timeless content, the quality of which is well known.I very much enjoyed Paul Sparer's reading. I found his rich bass voice and eloquent style ideal for Gibran and very pleasing to listen to. Unlike another reviewer, I was not at all distracted by the music; in fact, I barely noticed it. Taste in such things is a personal issue, and for what it's worth, this reading very much suits my tastes."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Here is a book that will get your spiritual side working again.  This book subscribes to no particular religion(s), but gives much to reflect upon.  This is a short book.  It will only take you around an hour or so to read it.  But if you want to take a break from the hectic day-to-day lives we lead and think about the deeper meanings of life, this book is for you.  It's the story of a prophet that comes to a town and gives the townspeople his wisdom.  They ask him questions about life, and he gives them deep spiritual answers.  Simple concept, great read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The prevailing popularity of Gibran's PROPHET lies in only one secret: he writes his poems with readers in his mind. The compassionate poet I come to know through his lines, Gibran did not write to impress, shock or confuse but to communicate truth with highest poetic beauty. THE PROPHET addresses 27 essential subjects of life that concerns everyone - love, freedom, children, work, self-knowledge, friendship, time, beauty, death to name a few. I have this book for many years but this is a kind of poetry that ripens with time and each time you take a sip, it still surprises you with refreshing revelations. Also recommended are his less known books, A TEAR AND A SMILE, SAND AND FOAM and THE GARDEN OF THE PROPHET."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love the Prophet and tend to buy copies to give to people who may need it's message.  I don't ever loan mine out because it never comes back!  This book speaks on all matters human!  I've owned it since I was 14 and go back to it constantly.  I especially love the sections on children, love and marriage.  It's a wonder insightful read and I highly recommend it.  It's also rather spiritual which is lovely.  It's not like the bible, but easy to read and take in.  It can give you peace when you need it.  Please consider adding it to your library."}

We follow this spiritual man as the loving townspeople seek him out for wisdom.  There is ultimately great sadness when he departs.I would describe these writings as poetic, philosophic prose for daily spiritual living.  There are many sound words, with a relaxed style, and a somewhat universalistic belief.  It is okay.Lord's blessingsScott"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Pure mastery in words revealing the essence of life. Very simply, this book speaks to everyone. It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe. It brings tears to me each time I read it, because if your mind is open, you will achieve a feeling of higher existence upon completion of your reading. I hope you will take that understanding and infuse it within all you do.I also recommend listening to Richard Harris' reading of this book, though it may be out of print these days."}

And even after you have finished, the message keeps playing on and on in your mind? Well, this book is one of them (if you have luckily found other books by other author).It is the exploration of self, soul, community, nature, and universe. No matter what religion you hold, from where you came or who/what you are. This is a book for every human being to know and keep in perspective what they are doing everyday."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I turn to The Prophet for perspective whenever life gets distorted and seems to be on its own track. This book offers poetic and visionary commentary on some of the most vital points of living, and does so in a creative, thought-provoking way. I first learned of Kahlil Gibran and The Prophet during a sermon at a Unitarian Universalist church, and I ran to get the book. It's occupied an important place on my bookshelf ever since. It helps me realize that life is a process, and letting go is a big part of moving forward. It also reminds me to be mindful of how I think about and interact with the world. It keeps things in perspective. The Prophet is an inspirational read."}

I have so many questions unanswered by this book. Why were Dr. Potter and Myrtle suffering through the Crimean war when they didn't have to be there? Was it Myrtle's utter devotion that kept her there? Why was Potter there? Were they camp followers? Also, did Myrtle bear Georgie and his wife's children for them because the wife couldn't? Or am I dreaming? There seems so much allusion in this book and I feel dumb for not getting what the other reviewers are getting from it. For me, it wasn't clear or easy to follow and I am not a stupid person. I'm a bit disappointed but will try another book of hers and hope that I will enjoy it more.."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It is amazing how some writers can blather on for hundreds of pages and yet be barren of memorable phrase or image, yet how a select few demonstrate the maxim of &quot;less is more.&quot;  Beryl Bainbridge and  her most recent novel Master Georgie surely fall into this latter category.  Each chapter in this short (190 pages) novel takes its title from a  picture illustrating its contents.  This is an effective technique, as the  photographic image provides both a jumping-off point for Bainbridge's  particular scene and narrator (the novel is given from several points of  view) and a framing device for the scene. I look forward to more of her  fiction."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book is well written and very organized. The author did an excellent job of explaining a complicated subject and I was surprised at how easy it was to read. It was so interesting and informative that couldn't put the book down once I started to read it. I purchased four more books of different titles and read them with the same ease. It's not that the subject is any easy read but it was so clearly explained and flowed very nicely as it untangled many questions that I had concerning prophecy. I purchased this title for a friend of mine and highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Bible prophecy."}

It was that engaging.  I remember it took me hours, and then when my mom caught me still awake, I lied and told her I had just woken up.The point in that is that as a small child, I found this book so intriguing that I was reading, writing, and counting for fun, well past my bedtime.  As an adult, I love the wit.  As a parent, I love that I get to share the childlike love for it all over again.This is such a fun book with real learning potential too.  Love it."}

Always a delight, our kids would laugh at the silliness while learning a lesson about life. We started a great habit of reading two or three books before bed, and the kids loved them. Soon, they would memorize many of the phrases, beginning a lifelong passion for reading.Every kid should experience reading books by the Berenstains while growing up. The characters are well developed, the rhyming phrases help kids become enthusiastic about reading, and the messages about life make them think.  Bears On The Moon got my son and daughter asking questions about space and interested in the great beyond.  Combine this with other fun Berenstain Bear books and your kids will sit enthralled as you turn the pages. Highly recommended."}

Itani is a wonderful writer who gets inside each of these worlds and let the reader have his and her own experience. We become involved in the lives of her characters and we feel their joys and sorrows."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wanted to like this book, but I expected a lot, and found it a disappointment.  The first half about Grania's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective, even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling.  As far as the second half, I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI, and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions.  I didn't see how it added to the story at all, and at this point in the book I really wished I wasn't reading it, but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened, and I felt that the ending was a let down.  Mostly, I feel that this topic could have been really, really engrossing, new, and compelling, but the book's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat.  I won't recommend this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really enjoyed &#34;The Deafening.&#34;  I read it after reading another book by Itani which I really enjoyed.  Like most Americans I don't know as much about Canada as I should.  The novel grabbed my attention at the beginning and held it to the end.  It also made me feel so lucky that I have my hearing.  The scenes of the hardships of the men fighting WW1 were difficult to read, but that is war and I think it is something we all should think about."}

In the process she made significant progress and discoveries.  A world traveller when most women rarely left there own local home areas, Lady Franklin is an inspiration for the ages.

{"label": 5, "raw": "I am continually puzzled by the publishing industry's \"prizes.\"  This book takes up an astonishing amount of shelf space in book stores.  Cover to cover there is nothing in it.  It is like reading a cut and paste book.  The characters are thin, flavorless, cliched, sleep-inducing.  The same with the dialogue.  I am still trying to determine what the author's purpose was, unless it was to bore us to tears (those would be the only tears shed).  I felt like it was written by an automaton, someone who does not care about the craft of writing but thinks she is precious.  There is no strength to the story or the sentences.  I actually felt insulted by this drivel.Read The Deptford Trilogy, by Robertson Davies.  Now there is a circus story you won't forget."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wasn't sure about this book after some of the reviews, etc. I guess the whole circus thing wasn't of interest to me, and so I put off buying this title for months. But last week, I gave in when it was listed at a phenomenal price. And I have to say, I loved it!It is by far the best thing I have read on my Kindle. Exciting, romantic, adventurous and slightly sorrowful at times. The characters were unforgettable. I adore Jacob at age 21 (and age 93) and he is a wonderful protagonist. This book is about circus life and the tragedy of a young man, but it is a love story as well. It is also filled with creatures great and small. So would I recommend this? Yes... because Water For Elephants is fabulous."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I found some of the \"old-timey\" phrases and circus lingo a bit difficult. I had to use the kindle dictionary as much as I could but most things weren't in there. I am still kind of confused about what \"red lighted\" really is. I need to Google that phrase. Anyway, beside the lingo I found a really interesting story. I never really think this about a book but I kind of wish this book were longer. I wanted to know more about the key relationship that the author creates. She really could do another book with material I think she left out, like what happens next.I recommend this book, especially if you are looking forward to the movie with Reese Witherspoon, Robert Pattinson, and Christopher Waltz."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I understand some of the criticism, but does a book have to be a literary masterpiece to be immensely enjoyable?  The overwhelming positive reviews explain why not.It is well researched, but maybe the plot stretched a bit too far at times and low quality dialogues have taken away from the book's otherwise star quality.The depression era was well represented, gave a good realistic feel of the troubled times and the people.  Circus setting was pure genius, and made it so interesting.Overall, it is a very enjoyable book, very readable."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a well told, interesting story.  It  belongs in the historical fiction genre; the subject is the travelling circuses which tried to make a financial go of it during the Great Depression.  It is not a pretty picture, but as in much of historical fiction, it has a virtuous hero, and a very upbeat ending.  It also has an added dimension: the story is told by the hero as he resides in a nursing home, and suffers from the condescending  attitudes toward the patients there.  This aspect of the book was particularly good, and for me the most genuinely moving.  For that reason, I wish the author hadn't felt the need to give even this sub-plot such a \"nice\" ending."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "In addition to writing an engaging story that offers a glimpse into a fascinating world foreign to most of us, Ms. Gruen shows herself to be a master \"architect\" with this novel, crafting a story that flows seamlessly between two radically different eras in her protagonist's life. The book starts with a flashback, so you know at some point it's going to bring us back to the opening scene. But Ms. Gruen does so in such a surprising and unexpected way, with a twist that left my jaw on the floor. It's not an exaggeration to say I was stunned.With Riding Lessons and Flying Changes, Ms. Gruen proved she was capable of writing good commercial fiction.With Water For Elephants, she proves herself capable of writing a great American novel."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "With the making of a Film based on this book and all of the rave reviews about it, I guess I had high expectations.  Don't get me wrong, I found most of it entertaining, but I think the story lacked in its development, and I never figured out why religion was ever even brought up among the characters in the earlier part of the book, when it apparently had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also a bit of a let-down because it was just too \"happily ever after\" for me.The funny thing is that I'm not a big fan of Circuses in general, but surprisingly, I found the source material to be rather fascinating,  So, if anything, this book will propel me to look into more historical reading material on Circuses from the 19th century to the turn of the 20th Century."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've had this book for two years and only just read it last week.  Why did I wait so long???  This truely is a gem.  You feel like you know all the characters, and the ones you don't know so well are introduced with enough hints and inuendos that you can easily imagine their colorful pasts.  I fell in love with the elephant.  She brought a wonderfully odd twist to the story.And as for the author, I was half way through the book before I paid attention to the jacket picture and realised that it was a female. She wrote exactly as a man would tell the story.  The elderly Jacob was perfectly portrayed.  She has obviously been around very old people and knows how they act and react to all kinds of situations.I truely did not want the story to end."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book.  And to think it was the first from Sara Gruen at that. This is a book that spawned the movie of the same name.  I saw the movie first, then read the book, then saw the movie again. As often happens, the book provides much more color than the movie ever could. For instance, the owner of the circus, Big Al, is shown in the movie in only one scene for a moment giving approval for a purchase.  Sara researched the subject of &#34;train circuses&#34; in detail.  The cruel practices common during the depression to stay in business are shocking, but make riveting reading as the backdrop for this story of growing up, awakening, and goal-seeking.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book grabs you from the minute you pick it up. It has intrigue, dysfunction, love, and amazing human-like emotions in the circus animals (from Rosie the elephant to Queenie the terrier).The movie was great, but the book had so much more depth and character-development.It seems so incredible that anything like this could happen in \"real life\", even during this period in US history. Tough circus life is described inamazing detail.The lopsided human love triangle adds another dimension to this book and its dysfunction. Would highly recommend this semi-fictional novel."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story takes place during the Great Depression.  It is a love story, but also a story about life with a traveling circus and all the rawness and crudeness that goes along with being part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth as remembered by Jacob Jankowski.  Normally, I'd much rather do my own reading, however David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones did an excellent job; the ninety-something-year-old Jacob was especially enjoyable.  When he read, I felt as if I were sitting next to him in the nursing home listening to his amazing story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Wow!  I picked this up to read on the airplane to & from Las Vegas.  I wound up finishing it while on my trip.Gruen is a wonderful story teller, you can tell she researched extensively for this novel.  While it's not a book really about a circus, that is the main setting for most of the book.  I really thought it would be a book all about Carnie Folk.  How far from the truth was I?!The story is told from the view of an ageing circus vet, which is different to begin with.  One would think that these types of stories would be told from performer's points of view & while that would be interesting, Jacob's POV is just as intriguing as another other's would have been.It's a great short read that's captivating & spellbinding."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First I must mention that I love books that take you to a time and place that you have no knowledge about and in this case it's circus life in the first half of the 1900's. It was fascinating to read what life was like in those days for those who worked in the circus, from performers to the labors. As for the book itself I did enjoy it, but I wouldn't call it a page turner and often in the first quarter of the book I thought about just putting the book down and starting something else a little more exciting to read. However the farther into the book I got the more I started to care about the characters the more invested in the book I became. In the end I was very glad I continued to read the book and now I can say I would recommend the book to friends."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a very beautiful, well-written story that at times had you really feeling - both good and bad feelings - for many of the characters. Jacob lived a hard life after his parents died but I appreciated his tenacity. He was determined to make it in the circus and to make it in life. I throughly enjoyed the ending and I think if I was Jacob that that's how I'd want to spend the rest of my days too. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a story about real life, struggles, love, loss, and hope."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This unique story brings back a slice of the 1930s, the long gone circus world of the past, but not the usual bigtop action.  The main character is without giving away anything serves in a position that straddles the worlds of performer and worker and yet belongs to neither. There's madness, grinding poverty, tradgedy, revengeexcitement, bewilderment, surprises, and revelations, but I don't believe a review should be a book report, so trust me if you like suspense, tinged with the meaning of life itself, please do yourself the favor of reading this wonderful novel.  I wish I could erase my memories and do so afresh.  Jim."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This novel made me want to meet someone who had worked on a circus before.  The prologue is all I read in the store and I immediately felt the need to buy it because of the mystery.  The book is filled with exciting storylines that will capture your attention and keep it there throughout the story--hoping that the storyline will end as you hoped.When you get to the part in the book that the prologue mentions, the actual outcome will surprise you. The animals all find a way into your heart and the characters are all worth remembering and holding on to.  I recomend this book for anyone interested in historical fiction or even science fiction because while it revolves around reality, a cirus, the way that it is written almost feels like science fiction."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The story line is simple, man meets girl, falls in love and must get past all obsticles in the way of their love BUT I loved the descriptions of all the characters, time and events. ie.traveling circus. I do not think the idea was so original.ie boy meets girl, ect. but the research that the author put into the circus idea was just great. I actually felt like I learned something about a life I would never had even thought to learn anything about. I would definatley look for more titles from this author because her research and time put into her characters and themes is fantastic."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was extremely happy with every aspect of this book until, in one of the final chapters, when Uncle Al tells Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic, or as he puts it, a \"paragon schizophonic\".  After reading this, there seemed to me to be simply too many similarities with an older novel I read in 2006, William Styron's modern classic SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  A beautiful Catholic woman and a handsome Jewish man who fight a lot due to the man's schizophrenia, another younger man who is new to their 'group' who has feelings for the woman...sex...death...the only dfference seems to be the circus setting and the fact that in this, the woman DOESN'T die and ends up married to the new, younger man.  A nice book, but not extremely original, at least not in the romantic storyline."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is my new favorite book. Besides being a GREAT story, I feel like I have made many new and interesting friends.  Sara Gruen demonstrates a gift for characterization.  Each character transcends his/her strengths and weaknesses to portray the good, the bad and the ugly of circus life in the post-depression era.  She truly captured the mystique of \"running away to join the circus\" through her characterization.Jacob Jankowski's (the narrator & featured characher) sense of humor is priceless.  I found myself either chuckling out loud or squirming in disgust throughout his storytelling.I found the book difficult to put down; yet, I did not want it to end.If you don't read another book this summer, read this one.  You will experience a myriad of emotions--happiness, sadness, fury, longing, relief, distress, even enchantment. . ."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What took me so long to discover this book?  I hadn't heard about it from anyone, just found it during a \"browse.\"  I've been looking for a good read for so long and \"Water for Elephants\" was right there the whole time.  I can't wait to read Sara Gruen's other books and when I finish them, her new one should be available.  She brings to life the good, the bad and the ugly of the circus world and her characters are vivid and full of life.  I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and falling in love with the main animals.  I couldn't wait to get to the next page...and the end was worth the whole trip.  For me it was one of those books that I was sorry to finish.  Thank you, Sara Gruen, for the beautiful journey."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First of all, Sara Gruen tells a really good story. People and animals both have their moments. What most impresses me though is her ability to show the feelings and memories of an old man. Once old, we tend to forget that the old man in a nursing home was once a part of exciting and dangerous events.To me, the viewpoint and dialogue of Joseph at 90 (or 93) really makes this book.Give it a read.And now the point of the Audio review:  If you like the book then you will find the unabridged audio a real treat. The reader captures the characters and takes you right along. We have listened to the story twice and still appreciate the skill of the reader and the beauty of this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I used to love to read, however it has been ages since a book has captured me like this one did. The description of characters is both dear and terrible at times.  The description of the life with the circus in this time in history is fascinating. Not really for young readers, it is a bit lusty in some areas but not offensive to me. I have not experienced the movie yet, it will be a challenge to capture the quality of this  book.  I look forward to reading more of Sara Gruen novels."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I passed over this book many times but one day decided to take a chance. I was not expecting such a great read. Read the entire book in a day and was left wanting more. Such as, did they ever find Walter's and Camel's body after the train stopped? Did they ever capture or prosecute Blackie and his gang for murder? Wish I knew more. Maybe there will be a second book later. Meantime, for those of you not steeped in elitist review criticism, this book is a wonderful surprise."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is simply just a wonderful book!The characters are well defined, each and everyone of them!  You care, you like, you love, you hate!The story unfolds with Jacob, at 91 or 93...he is not sure, and his life.Schooled in vetinary science, he finds himself adrift after the loss of his parents and any financial stability.  He joins the circus and meets a cast of characterS like no other.His love for Marlena, his ultimate choices and growth...the paths taken...andThen...he is 91 or 93...just read it...I can't wait to see the movie...it will be magic!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "One of the most entertaining piece fiction I've read in the past 12 months. During post-depression era, the protagonist, Jacob, is left penniless after his parents' sudden death. Completely aimless, he jumps the first train he sees and literally lands in a circus train, plunging him head-first into a fascinating world filled with performers of all shapes and talents, a miserly ring-master, a beautiful horse trainer and a liquor-drinking/Polish-tongued elephant named Rosie.Sara Gruen does an incredible job of incorporating history and urban legends: paralysis that afflicted thousands from drinking \"Jake\", an alcohol substitute concocted during The Prohibition; the humongous dead hippo that was preserved in formaldehyde to fool thousands of viewers (pickled elephant).I highly recommend this book; just sit back and let yourself get lost in this strange and fascinating story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a tremendously fun and interesting read... not to mention educational too. The whole travelling circus/sideshow thing has always fascinated me, so it was interesting to find a novel with that as it's backdrop. The characters felt very real and I found myself reading far past my bedtime because I wanted to see what was going to happen next.The only dissapointing part of the book to me was at the very end. I can see how some people like things to be tied up in a nice little bow, but to me it was so implausable that it almost ruined the whole reading experience."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story line captivated me from the first chapter.  It had ALOT of swearing and graphic sexual content which I didn't enjoy having to wade through and skip over.  I didn't think it added anything to the storyline, and felt that it could have been left out all together.I found the author commentaries at the end to be most fascinating.  It was interesting to read that the story line has some non-fiction events weaved into it.  I you don't mind filthy language and sexual content this is a great read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Nothing about this book appealed to me.  Not the subject matter, nor the title, nor the cover.  Pfttt.....nothing. A depression-era traveling circus?  What could be more....depressing?  My sister delivered into my hands one day and said, \"Read it.\"  And I did.  I read it while cooking. I read it while eating.  I read it when I should have been sleeping.  I read and read and wanted to read more.  Now I hand it to you and say, \"Read it\".  You won't be sorry."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Maybe I'm missing the bandwagon (no pun intended), but all these reviews that say \"amazing\", \"best book I've ever read\", etc.??  I don't get that.  I was drawn to the story and the characters, and it was well-written.  It was an easy read, so I finished it in a day and a half.  However, I don't consider it anything more than a fun read--something good for the beach or the plane. I'm defintely not seeing the hype."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "An interesting way to showcase circus history & a way of life that is no more.Although this is a fictionalized account, it was based on bits & pieces of fact from Circus History.The photographs were the best.They were a nice addition to the book.The nursing home drama/tie-in was a bit too much.I guess it was a play on the theme of running away to join the circus...Just never heard of someone who ran away from a nursing home in a wheel chair to join the circus & was successful with it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was very moving for me.  The way Gruen writes about the older character seemed so very well done.  Even though I am not old, I felt older reading those passages.  Gruen moves back and forth from present day to the past very smoothly and it is always a seamless transition for the reader.  Great story, good characters, loved Rosie the elephant. Very thought provoking and I really adored the old carny photographs sprinkled throughout the book.  Never thought I would enjoy a depression era book, but this one was really well done."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed this book a lot, despite the fact that some of the stuff said doesn't match the era in which it was written. I wasn't as bothered by the small issues as some of the other reviewers were, apparently. It is a work of fiction after all. Sure, there were quite a few cliches, but not to the point of distraction. I liked the animals and their personalities, namely Rosie, the star of the show. She stole my heart and when she was a victim of violence, my heart broke for her.Having the old man relive his memories of the circus was very compelling and tied the story of then and now together nicely. The ending made me cry, but not why you'd expect."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I normally don't select bestsellers for reading pleasure; they so often disappoint. Had my book club not selected this for discussion I probably would not have read it. But I am so glad I did. The book is well writen, not just a good story, but excellent writer's craft. Any person over fifty with any empathy at all will identify with the story teller. Younger people will identify with the main characters in the circus story. I am not particularly interested in circus history, but this was fascinating. The ending is especially wonderful...fanciful but wonderful."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Like many who were critical of this book, I truly did want to love it. However, the writing was simple and flat, the characters lacked depth or conviction and the ending was a huge let down. Jacob was infuriating as he claimed to love these animals and then becomes sexually sidetracked while his Rosie was being beaten half to death. It made me sick to my stomach. Over and over, he continued to behave like a helpless child while this animal was brutalized. Time and again, he is either incredibly violent or he is impotent and seemingly defenseless. In the end, each conflict is suddently and hastily resolved with little authenticity. What a shame as this could have been a deeply moving and engaging story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished reading Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.  It was one of my most favorite reads to date, and I read alot of books!  I loved how the book started in the nursing home with the older Jacob and how he reveiled how it felt to be old and most of the time forgotten.  His family viewed it as a duty to go and visit him..And then it switches to a young Jacob and tells the story of his adventures working in a circus.  For anyone who wanted to run away to the circus as a child, you will definately love this book.  I could not put it down. It is exciting one minute and has you on the edge of your seat and the next it is endearing and makes you feel like you really know the characters.  I give this book 5 stars and if you want a really good read, you will do the same."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "After \"Riding Lessons\", which I loved - and \"Flying Changes\", which was a huge disappointment to me, I was not sure what I would find in \"Water for Elephants\".  Wow - what a great read!  Research does pay off hugely - when it enables a writer to place the reader inside another world so easily - the world of the circus. This was a world totally foreign to most of us - but now, so familiar, thanks to Sara.  This book satisfied my three requirements - transportation (take me away from all this),  levitation (lift my spirits and leave me thinking good thoughts) and infiltration (let me get inside the characters so I feel I really know them). Reading \"Water for Elephants\" is time well-spent.  I'm happy to know Sara is working on a fourth book. I'll be first in line to buy it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The novel is sure a pleasant surprise. First, I like how the author interlaces the novel between the perspective of the older and younger antagonists. Mr Jankowski is animated and adorable. I felt like I could really take a glimpse inside an old person's mild. He is a young guy trapped in an old man's body. Jacob is young and innocent, but not as memorable as his older self. The adventure he had is almost like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. Sure, there were times I was confused. It doesn't seem so believable to have a college graduate jumping from one railcar to another, and the sex scene is unnecessarily. (I guess female readers demand certain rewards with reading romance novels.) {Spoiler Alert} I still don't understand why Uncle Al needs August for the circus. It seems like Uncle Al could have just replaced August with Jacob and the novel will shortened by half.I wish Ms Gruen all the best and am looking forward to her coming books."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Seeing Jacob young and old, and hearing how time affected him, and how he still remained connected to his history after all those years was  great. It really added to the book and really tied the story together for me. It was very dramatic for me to see how this once active and interesting man was effected by the years, and what age does to a person. It made me think how we cast aside many of our elderly friends and folks not paying attention to their stories. Especially key when thinking alone about Jacob's past. I have a great love and respect for elephants and at many times i was so angered in the story and could feel the emotions that Jacob was experiencing. It was such a strong event that occurred with Rosie, and without giving the story away was vindicating. Really don't want to watch the movie now as afraid would not live up to how i imagined everything or if they changed the story too much."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Great and dramatic character development, some you love, some you care about, some you hate and one or two you simply loathe...great characters living life with all of its pathos, humor and drama in a Depression era circus...Some points will make you laugh out loud, some smile in suprise and some where you want to say, \"That sorry, no good SOB...\"  Some will make you gasp in joy and delight, one or two in horror. All in all, a very good book....The characters, the pathos and the humor, the living of life, make it come alive and stay with you long after the last page is turned.  I was sorry to seen it end, and that is the way a good book is supposed to leave you. This one is good, though it never really talks about or explains the title \"Water for Elephants...\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Seldom has a book moved me as much as this one did.  Perhaps it's because I listened to the audiobook version, and the narrators voices were perfect for the different stages of life in the book.  Perhaps it's because my 98 year old mother-in-law is in a nursing home, but the author captured what life for a 90+ year old must be like in a nursing home facility.  In addition, I LOVE the circus, even though today's pale in comparison to those that were under canvas.  Without doing a spoiler, I can only say that it's been a long time since the ending of a book brought tears to my eyes.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Love love love this book. This book is so much more than I thought it would be. Its beautiful, exciting, eye opening, and intriguing. I fell in love with the story and its characters from the beginning. Favorite character of all?... Rosie for sure... yes the elephant. Shes innocent, smart, witty, out smarts her humans and seemingly has a wonderful personality. She is amazing. But of course this book is not just about an elephant. Its about love, hate, excitement, tyranny, rage, and some real good laughs. Definitely a book worth reading."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "While I don't completely regret reading this book about a young man who joins the circus as a vet in the 1930's, in hindsight I defintely would have chosen another book. It starts off with a bang, then slows down significantly in the middle, and it ends quite nicely. It's your typical boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl story. I did enjoy the historical fiction aspect of it and I truly enjoyed the final portion of the book where the author writes about why, how, and what she did to write this book.I'd recommend it to the causal reader, but a more sophisticated reader may want to look elsewhere."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Loved every bit of this book. The narration is well-planned...we follow Jacob Jankowsi, a would-be vet with his father until his parents are killed in a car crash. Jacob hits the road, and one night jumps on a train. Little does he know that that one jump will change his life forever--for the better and the worst.Gruen delights readers with circus life during the depression, with strong character development and a strong plot. You root for the animals, who are heinously mistreated by the ringmaster, and you root for the workers."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was pleasantly surprised by this story.  Granted, it had wonderful reviews here on Amazon, but there have been other popular fiction novels with the same reviews, and I loathed those books.I don't need to go into any details as the book has been so thoroughly reviewed, but I will say there was so much in the book that touched me.  Ninety or ninety-three year old Jacob's story was so emotional...it's going to stay with me for quite awhile.  Bravo!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants has recently taken over the spot of my favorite book. The book flawlessly alternates between the main character's present day experience in a nursing home and his memories of his life during his early 20's. I was skeptical about the switching at first since many books that do this are usually confusing and I have to keep turning back a few pages to see what time period I'm in, but the author does this perfectly.I completely fell in love with the main character, both the 92 year old and 23 year old versions of him. As someone who works in a nursing home, his experiences were so realistic and the author captured this perfectly.The book was extremely well written and it was obvious that Gruen did her research. I found myself looking for more information about travelling circuses and downloading pictures from them, especially elephants, after reading this."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this books years ago when it came out and thought it was good, but not great.  I reread it as a book club selection and liked it much better due to the depth of characters.  The author has done her research in the life of the circus performers.  I hated the cruelty shown to some of the animals, but I know some of those things took place.  True love wins with the risks people are willing to take to be with their \"soul mate\".  The end is pretty unbelievable with an old man running away to join the circus (again).  However, it made me hopeful that this ignored man would find happiness in his last years."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wish that I could say that I was one of the readers of  Water For Elephants, the well researched novel by Sara Gruen, who was graciously transported to the circus world of the 1930's, but sadly I can't.I am not one who acclaims the romance of  the beautiful Marlena, the circus horse rider and Jacob, whose personal tragedy causes him to walk away from his final exams at Cornell Vet school.  Instead, I am left thinking that perhaps, I should have read Twilight instead.  The an essential problem of reading a romance in which the reader does not care for the romantic protagonists, is that it takes the heart out of the book.Though there was enough in the side characters, animals and atmosphere to carry the book but alas there I often found Gruen's phrasing annoying and clunky.  I have decided in all fairness to Ms Gruen and her many fans that I will desist from reading any more of her works and we shall all continue on quite happily."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "\"I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other.\" So begins Sara Gruen's near love letter to the circus, and it's inhabitants. Told in flashbacks by the eldery Jacob Jankowski, it's how he came to work as the vet for the Benzini Brothers, a second rate Barnum and Bailey, traveling across the country. A cast of ragtag characters bring the bigtop to life including a little person named Walter, the sadistic ring master August, and his beautiful performer wife Marlena who Jacob desperately longs for.This would make a fanatastic movie if it isn't already in progress. It has all the elements, from melancholy sentiment, to sweeping romance, and the allure of the magical world of the three rings."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Page after page this novel is filled with interesting facts, experiences and history. That it's a memoir of a patient/resident of a nursing home is a literary vehicle of genius. How remarkable to live the life of a this young man, one we can easily identify with, through this period of American history (30's, 40's) only to end up with him in a current-day nursing home, the finest of which are lonely places indeed.My wife and I just recently visited an uncle who lived in a very fine nursing home in another state and were pronounced \"saints\" by the staff who said no one ever visits these people. That's why I'm haunted by the ending of this book.I've also paid more attention to stories of the intelligence of elephants, their almost human sense of justice. Perhaps I mean their more-than-human sense of justice.A wonderful book. You will be glad you read it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants offers some thing for everyone.  If you're a pragmatist you will love the research and facts concerning the circus of the depression era.  If a romantic, the ending will be for you. If you are young, the choices and frustrations suffered by Jacob will be yours. For me, a senior citizen, the gerentology  added greatly to the story.I thought it a great read especially since there are 70 years between the youth and aged of the story which is told in flashback form. There is little in common between the two periods of time except for love and the anticipation of all ages.Try it, you will like it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Amazing book which brings us into the life of a student at Cornell whose life changes dramatically and rapidly within a few days - and, as with all persons, those dramatic changes influence the rest of his life.  The story is of a circus worker during the depression...and it brought back some vague memories of my early childhood, watching a small circus roll into town, watching the elephants parade through from the train depot and to a farmer's field where the \"Big Top\" would suddenly sprout with flags a-flying.  The story is told from the view of the worker who's now in his 90's...and is fascinating as to how the author mixes past and present to give a picture of an amazing whole."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is loaded with interesting words because Sara Gruen owns a commanding vocabulary, and utilizes her well-chosen words with precision.  She also understands how to set the hook and carefully reel her reader in.  She's a master angler.The story is entertaining and the setting--a train circus-- is interesting.  Obviously Gruen heavy research is what birthed the rich detail.While some call this a romance book, the romance is lacking and rushed.  This is more of an action-adventure \"who done it.\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I honestly didn't know what to expect when I started WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, but as I continued on hour after hour, I realized what a terrific book it is!  Set in post-Depression America and the Benzini Brother's Circus, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is full of emotions and flashes of great humor. All the characters, including the animals, all have pivotal roles throughout the story. This book is a great blend of history, mystery, love story and memoir.Highly recommend with 5 stars!!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Not going to lie, I bought this so I could read it before the movie came out (Robert Pattinson fan :-P).  While it was an easy read, I didn't love it. I found it difficult to appreciate the circus life with the description of it, but the characters were interesting.  The ending surprised me, so I loved that!  Nothing worse than a predictable novel.  There were many endearing and HUMAN situations and characters of the novel, so I found myself rooting for some characters and hating others.  Not every book I read invokes that kind of emotion in me.This story is a some-what of a page turner and (again) an easy read, but there was some kind of disconnect.  I can't quite define what was missing from this book, but I think it's worthwhile.  Would be great for a book club."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a pleasurable book to read.  Among its many virtues, is Guren's recreation of the atmosphere of depression era America, and a unique circus subculture that existed in what now must be viewed as the lost past.  Leading this tale is a genuinely likeable guy, a rarity in contemporary literature.  This hugely popular book is without serious lessons to preach or meaning to convey.  Rather, it is a good story which provided me with many hours of pleasant diversion."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really enjoyed this book!  I enjoyed the imagery of the circus and the settings, the historical facts of both the Great Depression and circuses during that time period, and I enjoyed learning more about circuses and the treatment of circus animals overall!There were parts that were disturbing - the mistreatment of circus animals, the mistreatment of circus employees, and the abuse of the lead woman.  But, overall, the plot was engaging and unique.  I especially enjoyed the flashback moments of the present lead character and his reminiscence of the past.  Make sure to read the Prologue! - it adds to the artistic nature of the writing style.I haven't seen the movie yet - hope it's as good as the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When Jacob Jankowski's parents died in an automobile accident, he was just about to become a Veterinarian.But, with that shock, and the shock of finding out that his parents didn't leave him the financial comforts that he had thought were there, Jacob, didn't take his last college exam.  And, he wondered into the life of a circus, where he learned a great deal about the human condition and about animals.During these tough Depression Era days, he lived in filth, but the animals meant a great deal to him.  So, he applied what he had learned at Cornell University Veterinarian School, to protect the animals, and anyone who he loved.This book was a story about love, loss and finding what matters most to you, when you've loss what seemed to be all that mattered."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For the most part this was a moving and fascinating story. Well written, the characters were vivid and appealing, even, at times, the villains. However, I found the way the story ended to be somewhat trite and not at all believable.Although the loyalty and brotherhood among circus people was clearly portrayed throughout, the end of the story reduced this excellent portrait of a mysterious and esoteric world into a fairy-tale. For me, the lovely flight ended with a thud, from a delicious learning experience to an insult to my intelligence."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "No, I won't forget WATER FOR ELEPHANTS any time soon. The prologue is one of the best I've read in a long time. I actually called a friend and ready it to her out loud. The characters, in particular, Rosie the elephant and Jacob are accurate and tender, each in their own sometimes sad and poignant way. This book is a summer hit for a reason--it's an enjoyable read filled with the peculiarities of circus life that intrigue and woo all who are drawn to such a menagerie known as the \"Greatest Show on Earth.\" ~Carol D. O'Dell"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A wonderful story!  If nothing else this is an insight into the aging process.  As a child growing up in the 40's my dad took me to  watch the set up of Ringling Brother's Circus when it came to town and we went back that night to watch the teardown.  I never saw a show until I was 12 years old and worked watering horses for my pass into the show.  I remember getting to hold a very small tiger cub that had been recently born.  It was a thrill I will never forget.  So very glad that a friend told me to read &#34;Water for Elephants&#34;.  I am sure that I will reread it again in the future.  Buy it!  You won't be sorry if you remember the circus coming to town!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I couldn't put this book down. I have seen the awards it won, but never thought about getting it, I wondered who this Sara Gruen is, never read her books. SO I didn't go out of my way to pick it up. Somebody brought it in to work. We have a bookshelf full of books that we share. I saw it and thought, OK, now I am going to read that, it is here, I keep seeing it, I am taking the plunge!How wonderful. I was completely and totally into the book after reading the first 4-5 pages. I couldn't put it down. I loved it, this isn't my type of book normally. However, it is a great read. I felt like I was standing next to the big top through the whole book. Get it, read it and enjoy it, that is the purpose of this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Take a chance and read this book.  It is wonderfully written.  Such an interesting book to take the lead character and having him in a nursing home, thinking of his life... and what a great life.  What a heart warming story.  I'm fascinated by the freakish carnivale life, and this didn't disappoint (but uphold) that theory!  If you're in for an uplifting tale of struggle and happiness in an unexpected way, you've found the perfect all-around book.  Enjoy!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen delivers a readable tale that's a tad too formulaic to be fully engaging. In the same way that the narrator of the story insists from personal experience that it is impossible to carry enough water to slake an elephant's thirst, I'd insist that this container doesn't hold enough water to satisfy a serious reader.Also noted: the description of animals and animal behaviors is approximately cartoony, and takes away from the whole.On the flip side, it is an easy read that won't occupy more than an evening and Gruen does offer up some fascinating historical details about old-style railroad circuses, which altogether comes off as plausibly true."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Frankly, all of the good things have been said about this book by other reviewers. I can only thank Public Radio that had a review of it. Otherwise I would not have heard of it.One of the things that the book points out is how tough life was during the depression.  American today have no concept of what it was like for people who earned no money, had no money, and had no place to go. There were no homeless shelters, no social security.  It was a different world.Gruen does a great job of showing the read the America of the Depression years and also tells a wonderful story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Very well written and and very grabbing. There were, however, 2 raunchy parts that were a little graphic, especially since they didn't really effect the whole story much. These moments felt as if they were elaborated on specifically in to draw in a larger audience via random moments of smut. For me, it cheapened an otherwise 5 star book. Really now, that was an image of a cartoon character that I did not want inside my head!LIke I said. Beautifully written--but I would have preferred if the aforementioned parts were briefly stated so you knew they happened and then moved on [like the rape scenes in Khaled Hosseini's book (Kite runner, or even the marital scenes in 1000 splendid suns) ]."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm usually drawn to books written about the depression era, as I have heard so much about it from my parents.  This book is not only that, but a great insight to the circus life during that time.  I had a hard time putting this book down in the evenings (after a day at work), and it was good timing that my spouse was out of town for the week.  Very well written, a great story, and a page turner. I'll be buying copies for future gifts."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Loved this book.  It portrays the life of survival of humans and animals alike.  It has always amazed me how elephants put up with us ignorant humans and our slow mentality in catching on as to how to treat them according to their abilities. The fact that elephants haven't done away with all evil handlers is a testament to the amazing personality, patience and attitude of their creation. The circus realm has a lot of shame, guilt and blame placed at its feet. Even though this is a fictional story, the real stories of circus elephants is much worse and a hard read.  I'm looking forward to another place in time where all will live in peace with all living things as this great earth was intended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Im usually skepical when it comes to reading a book that has become a movie . I end up either loving the movie and not liking the book or loving the book and not liking the movie. THIS book was stunning in detail and takes the reader into the 'Big Top' in such detail that you can almost smell the peanuts! It contains violence but it is told with such skill that the reader understands just how brutal humans can be ....but the main character is the hero and does make a difference . As for the romance...its innocent and well written. There is something for all in this story and I see now why it was made into a movie. I have not seen it yet but I can only imagine !"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed reading about the history of the circus and the anecdotes shared by Sara Gruen.  It takes you back to an age of innocence in your life where the Circus was pretty close to the best thing that ever happened to you.  The elephants and the brave ladies that rode on them.  The clowns and the ittle people.  I enjoyed recreating those memories while reading this delightful and sweet account of two circus runaways who fall in love.  Their story was predictable in so many ways.  The old Jacob part was just sad and it left a sour feeling.  However, I did enjoy reading about the circus people and their lives.  The parades and the drama behind the curtain.  The roustabouts working so hard and sleeping in crowded spaces,yet what an adventure! to travel around the country from town to town brining smiles to millions and enjoying the camradie of the circus!  I loved that part."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Who would ever guess that a story about a circus would be so fantastic? The author, Sara Gruen, knew that's who.  Well, she was right. Jacob is lost after the death of his parents.  When he is just a final exam away from his veterinary license he stumbles upon a traveling circus train and inadvertently joins.  Through Jacob we get a glimpse behind the scenes of the the characters, relationships, struggles, and class warfare of circus folk.  Intertwined in this interesting story of the circus is a love story.  I noticed that one of the other reviewers found the love story a bit trite, but I disagree.  I found the love story completely believable and the use of flashback extremely effective.  Most importantly, I must tell you, I cried.  I RARELY cry while reading.  You are are going to dig this book!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished listening to this audio book and I have to say it was truly wonderful.  I felt the circus come alive, great imagery and historic detail.  You could picture the circus`s shows with great detail.  I listened to this while commuting and found myself really enjoying my drive to and  from  work, traffic and all. The only negative was the sex.  My tween daughter really wanted to read this book because of the movie trailer but I had to say no right away after just the first chapter or so.  It really didn't add that much to the story and wasn't needed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I didn't realize this book had been out for so long when I ordered it from Amazon.  Can't believe I hadn't heard of it before because it was a fantastic book I should have picked up sooner.  I think a movie is being made about the book, but I am glad I read the book first.  It's a quick read for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Definitely entertaining.  After I finished it, I felt like I was still transported back to the 1930's circus, and it took several hours to stop thinking about it.  Worth reading for sure."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished \"Water for Elephants\" the day before yesterday!  I can't seem to find anything I want to read now as that story just won't go away.  It was far and beyond one of my favorite books.  I just loved it!  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  Now I want to see more pictures of the old circuses.  Amazing what she was able to capture with her words and that she could understand what an old man could be feeling and thinking.  I love it when I can find a book like hers.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "At first I was skeptical about reading a book about a circus, but everyone I know that has read the book had given it great reviews.  I'm glad to say I was not disappointed.  The author did a great job with this book and detailing the era in which it is written.  I bought this book on my Kindle and can honestly say I could not put it down - the convenience of having my Kindle books available through apps on my cell phone / computer and the actual Kindle made it even harder to put down and all the more exciting to read.  I highly recommend this book, it did not disappoint in any way!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read both of Sara Gruen's previous books - primarily because they were horse stories.  I was really looking forward to her next book and was disappointed to see that it wasn't about horses at all.  It hit the best seller list and I read the reviews.  It didn't appeal to me at all.  I read more reviews.  Eh. Finally, I decided to read it.  I'm so glad I did!  This is one of those books that draws you in on the first page and doesn't let you go until the end.  I'm recommending this to everyone I know -and I'm recommending it to you.  Read it - you won't be sorry."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This books was one of my favorites for the year. This book flashes from present day Jacob, 93 living in a nursing home to Jacob's summer traveling with the circus during the 1930's Depression era. Not only do you have these rich circus characters and animals, but also you have the interesting time period. The writing is flawless, the characters/animals (Rosie, my favorite) are amazing, the plot keeps you interested, and you root for the Jacob in the past and his present condition.The slight twist in the whodunit revealed near the end was also suprising"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really enjoyed reading this book. I had to do so through tears most of the time. I really loved the way she wrote the story from both perspectives of Jacob as a young man and as an old man. It helped it mean more to me to read about it from his memory. It reminded me of what treasures we have in our elderly. I also loved to see all the old pictures, they were great. On the down side of the book there was more then needed sex and bad language in the story for me. But that's just me. I do like the book and am very glad I read it. I would suggest it to other adults to read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love books that make me feel the grit of sawdust between my teeth.  Sawdust?  Why, yes, if you're reading a circus murder mystery. Only, it isn't much of a mystery as you learn whodunnit on the second page.  Only, no, don't be so sure.  A lovely, you-are-there novel of the between-wars years in America, wherein one newly orphaned and penniless Jacob Jankowski runs away to join a down-at-the-heels circus whose owner has serious Ringling Brothers envy, complete with ladies fat and bearded, unfriendly dwarfs, and homicidal--wait, no, I'll give it away.  With an ending that made me smile all day after I finished the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "'Water for Elephants' provides an insiders peek behind the curtain of a traveling train circus. Anyone who ever went to a circus and played the games on the midway are rubes wanting to be thrilled, enchanted and take leave of reality for a day. The illusion lasts about as long as cloud of cotton candy. The inside story delves into the darker aspects of what makes the circus viable especially during the 1930's Depression era. The reader is introduced to a strict caste system from bosses to performers to roustabouts that determines one's position among a long train of characters. The practice of 'redlighting' is  particularly powerful, a Darwinian, survival of the fittest practice where the circus bosses have the used up roustabouts tossed from the train as excess baggage. Our hero is Jacob Jankowski that over the course of  only 3 1/2 months joins the circus. As a veternarian he does not fit into the caste system. Through his character we take a journey making allies with unlikely people, finding love and slaying personal deamons."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story, about a young man who runs away to the circus, is beautiful in the way it paints an older man near the end of his life in a loving, endearing way. Older people are real people whose value is in no way diminished. In fact, they have lived their life and survived life's most difficult challenges. And yet despite all they've learned and know, they are given so little respect. Every day they courageously cope with challenges that most of us have never even come close to experiencing. Even their family often treats them callously, or worse, like little children. Some older folk are cranky, like the character in this story, but considering what they've been through, they deserve kindness in return, not defensiveness. The treatment of this older man by nurse Rosemary in this book has inspired me to love older people and respect them more."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This novel is a rambling, disjointed and thoroughly annoying depiction of a highly forgettable era in Amercan history.  The characters are flimsy, the plot is circuitous and the endless stories of animal cruelty are downright depressing.  Perhaps the one saving grace is the author's use of Jacob's character as an elderly man who is looking back on his life with hindsight.  I cannot believe there has been such a fuss about this book and that someone was foolish enough to make it into a film.  Now that will be a real flop!  If I ever see this author's name again I will move away from it as quickly as I am able.  This was just a terrible book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Set in the Great Depression, Water for Elephants is a compelling tale, perfect for a book group discussion. Jacob Jankowski loses his parents in a car wreck and drops out of veterinary school. He finds his way aboard a circus train and begins a new life on the road. He meets and falls in love with both circus star, Marlena, who is married to the perverse animal trainer, August, and the seemingly unteachable elephant, Rosie.I was most taken by the circus details and the details from the Great Depression that Gruen used in the story. I was fascinated with life in the circus during those hard times. I also liked how Gruen moved the story back and forth in time from an elderly Jacob to a young Jacob."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of my all-time favorites!  For some reason, I put off reading this book for months.  I tried to convince myself that it didn't look interesting.  Was I ever wrong!  This will stay in my house, I will not trade or sell it, or loan it out.  It's that good!  Reading the author's notes, I discovered it was based on the the Biblical story of Jacob.  Then I had to read it all over again!  And I still loved it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a great story line, but I really get disgusted with the writers that think they have a free license to use the Lord's name in vain. It has become a disgusting passtime and all too prevalent &#34;thing to do&#34;.  And why do they do it? It adds nothing to the story. Just a disgusted feeling and sorrorful feeling for the author. It shows how the people of the world are falling away from God. That is one thing I miss with my Kindle, I always use a black marker and mark out that word from the sentences or stop reading the book altogether."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a wonderfully poignant book that slides seamlessly between the 90 Plus year old Jacob, and his remembrances of his youth when he was 23 and spent time with a traveling circus as its Veterinarian.  The frailities of Jacob who is now in the Nursing Home is portrayed so realistically that it almost seems like those parts of the story are actually written by an old person.  In counterpoint, the story of the younger Jacob's traveling circus adventures seems the same way, as if the author has actually experienced this lifestyle.  With twists and turns, heart melting moments of happiness, heart-wrenching moments of anger and sadness, this book is one that, once started, is hard to put down.  You'll be glad you chose this book to read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love the novel, Water for Elephants. It is the exciting tale of a young, veterinary student who ends up working for a third-rate, somewhat corrupt, traveling circus. He cares for the circus animals, while encountering danger, episodes of animal cruelty, violence and romance. It is a heart-pounding and endearing tale, told mostly in flashback.  The characters are larger-than-life, from the cruel circus owner, to the sideshow freaks, to the bawdy young ladies who perform for the grinning men - both onstage ... and off. I just loved this book from start to finish. And for those of you who have seen the film, the book has much more action, and less focus on the romantic angle. An action-packed, colorful story. I could not put it down."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was born in 1920.  I grew up during the Great Depression and the Prohibition eras.In 1965 we owned a bait and tackle shop in Venice, Florida.  At that time the Ringling Bros. Circus wintered there and we became acquainted with many circus people.  Our shop was a hangout for them and every evening after rehearsals they would stop by for a beer.The book: \"Water for Elephants\" is extremely well written and I am planning to read more of Sara Gruen's work.I have ordered two more copies and given them to friends.  They have given me very good reports."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was hesitant to read this book at first because I was concerned about the animal abuse. However, Sara Gruen did a wonderful job with keeping it at a minimum. I quickly scanned over one or two of the scenes and then realized when I was done reading the story, how the little bit of it added to the story.Well researched and well defined, Gruen takes you by the hand and leads you into the life of an elderly man who, from a nursing home, reflects back on his life in his younger years while he was a part of the circus life. Vivid and captivating, I felt as though I was a part of this exciting journey.There are thousands of reviews on this book, so I'll keep mine brief. Clearly stated, this is one work that will remain in my memory all the days of my life. Fascinating!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have seen this book on the shelves for sometime now and only just got around to reading it. It was so enjoyable that I read it in a day, I just couldn't put it down. The main character, Jacob, is intriguing without being over complicated. It is a peek into the history of the circus, all the while swirling a great mystery and love affair that will keep you glued to this page turner. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, mysteries, and a truly good read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was highly recommended to me by women in an assisted living facility where I teach, for whom one of the book themes--aging and loss of autonomy--resonated deeply. I found it an engaging read, though the story almost caves in under the weight of the author's research. The characters are archetypes I had the feeling I'd seen somewhere before, lacking complexity, and it was ultimately difficult to care about any of them. The shifts back and forth in time were distracting and superfluous. I felt manipulated by the fantastically sentimental ending, but still, it made me smile."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "In our hurried lives filled with responsibilities and all the stress associated with it, how many of us dream to run away with the circus?Well in Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, the central character Jacob Janjowski runs away from his life's troubles to join the Benzini Brothers train circus.In this new adventure Jacob comes of age with the circus freaks, clowns, and countless animals that dazzle the imagination of the many that come to peek into a world of wonder. He discovers love, hard work, and his passion for animals.Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen takes the reader on the lost world of the traveling circuits in an age that many lost hope because of the peril circumstances of the Great Depression.The first few pages simply grab you and you will not want to miss this page turner and the mystic circus world."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was skeptical of a book detailing life in a traveling circus.  But overall this was an entertaining and well written book.  There were a few things that didn't flow well or weren't really explained (or at least I didn't understand them) like why Jacob was so outraged at the gentleman who said he had worked at the circus or for what reason Marlena was throwing a suprise for her husband (that ended up going poorly).  But these uncertainties didn't stop me from enjoying the story.  Surprising twist.  Sweet ending."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I agree with several other people who found it amazing that this is a bestseller. As an author whose books sell poorly right here on Amazon, I wish I knew her secret. I found it disgusting on so many levels, hard to follow, and in the end, just not worth reading. Perhaps something in the last third of the book would have changed my mind, but I couldn't finish it. I can't remember the last time I threw a book into the garbage can, but I looked it over carefully, thought about the very act of throwing out a book, and then dropped it into the trash. I don't regret it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Watched the film first and loved it. The book didn't disappoint either. Even though I had watched the film it was an interesting read, it didn't feel boring to read what I've already seen. The characters's good, I especially liked Walter and some other of the minor roles, the rhythm of the writing flowing and easily read. Jacob's tone and style of talking is well carried through the book. It feels like you're there. It was also fascinating to get glimpses of his current, old life. What he had become after all of the adventures, an old man forgotten by his children and family, reliving his past. It was sad, and you could understand his grumpiness.There's just something about circuses that's fascinating. It was interesting to \"learn\" how the circus worked in the 30s, how they travelled by train, how the hierarchy was arranged, how you lived your life in a circus."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you are like me, you're wanting to read the book before the movie comes out in a few weeks.  I've heard about this book for months, but I never could bring myself to buy it.  A favorite actor of mine is in the movie, so I finally decided to read it.  I am sorry I waited so long to do so!  It's one of the best books I've ever read.  The author's words are so well-written and descriptive, they paint pictures in your mind.  GET THIS BOOK if you want a heart-warming, and at times, thrilling read!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "loved this book! wonderfully written! there was not one flaw in this book. im glad the author didnt focus fully on the romance perspective of the book and her going from jacobs youth to jacob as an elderly from chapter to chapter put a great spin on the story.my heart was broken when his family didnt come for him but it turned out with a good ending. if they wouldve come he wouldve went back to the old folks home and although theres no novel following this one, im sure he dies with the circus just like hes always dreamed to.cant wait to watch the movie :)"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A remarkably fast read,leaving the reader breathless from tight action and tingling suspense.  This book reveals the glitz and sparkle of the circus, along with its dark and terrible underside that lurks barely out of sight.  The two time frames - of old Jacob and young Jacob - are carried through smoothly by Gruen, who ties the events together  with skillful repetition of words and phrases.  I wish there were more novels that take place during the Depression - an era that had such enormous impact on our society and continues to reverberate in modern times.  This book did not make me want to run away and join a circus.  It did make me happy that movements toward animal-less circuses have made a toehold."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had some idea of the content of this book before I started reading, but was extremely impressed with the author's skill in opening the world of the Depression-Era circus, and the fascinating people who populated it.  Her ability to shift between the poignant situation of the aged Jacob, and the youthful enthusiasm and passion of the youthful Jacob made this novel 'work' better than most I've read in years.  The ending did catch me by surprise, and was absolutely delightful in all respects.  I will commend this book to the attention of anyone who wants to look through a window on the past, and the believable people who occupied that world -- told in the words of a very gifted author."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I picked this book up by chance at the bookstore. I was interested at once in the subject and the characters. I know nothing about the circus and was captivated by the descriptions of depression era circuses. This was all new territory for me and to find out in the notes at the end that all this information was based on fact was exciting.I loved having each chapter start with a picture from the Ringling Brothers circus archives. I wasso happy at the ending, I truly did not see it coming. Such a feel good story. I have recommended it to many of my friends, including my book club. Try it, you will like it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A very unusual book. I couldn't put it down. It gives an insight to circus life in the days when they travelled by train. It is written through the eyes of a young lad who traumatised by the death of his parents was unable to complete his final exam to become a vet and accidentally joins the circus. The characters and the animals are all very real. Some you love and some you hate (never the animals. Anyone who loves circuses and remembers (or would like to know) how they used to be will love this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story is lovely and you cannot put it down. I read every word from cover to cover. There are also authors notes, an interview with Sara Gruen, and questions for book group discussions.Now back to my title for review. So many of you gave the story away you should not rethink your reviews. Thank G-d, I had already chose to read this book when I read Riding Lessons. I had never read one review on this book before I bought it. I wonder what goody Sara has for us next. It will be fun as long as I stay away from reviews!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The idea of running away with the circus definitely appeals sometimes - especially when your own life has turned into one - but Gruen's gritty, real account of that life is enough to make me tuck in and contain my self to watching Cirque on tv. Scariest part about it is that I know it's based on the truth - not the story, but the time. She did great research on travelling circuses.The romance was gorgeous. And while I refuse to give out spoilers, I will tell you that she surprised me. I was sure the romantic outcome was going to come out one way and she made the change beautifully.The ending? Maybe a little saccharin, but why not? You can't leave the circus without candy floss."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm not sure what to say about this book.  I enjoyed it - it's a cute little historical fiction - but it wasn't fantastic.  just a few random thoughts on the book:* The most interesting character was Walter the dwarf clown and he had a very limited role.* Jacob, the narrator I liked more as a 93yo than as a 23yo, and I never really felt the connection between him and Marlena.* The grime of the circus itself was part of what kept me sucked in - that was brilliantly described.* In the end, I felt a great deal of sympathy for August - he wasn't a good man by any means, but he also was fighting some serious demons.Like I said, I liked the book but I don't feel I need to run out and watch the movie now ...."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This has become a must read with so many favorable reviews I kept looking forward to being captured by it.  It really is two stories in one book.  The old man's story is wonderful.  My father resides in a residency care facility and the insights of the old man made me think about what my father is facing.  The loss of dignity and the battling soul struck home.In my view the main story was only fair.  The story seemed to be telegraphed and I could not get my self terribly interested."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As a person in his 70s who deals with a mother-in-law in her 90s, I found much Jacob's trials in the nursing home close to home. That he could escape into the memory of his youthful connection with the circus was probably a life saver for him.Ms Gruen did a masterful job of separating and at the same time blending Jacob's experiences in his youth with those in his present state of being 90 or 93.It is worth reading this book all the way through to get to a surprising and wonderful end that I shall not reveal so as not to spoil it for others.Ms Gruen obviously researched circuses. Her attention to detail, both when she wrote about the circus and also when she wrote about the nursing home helped make the story realistic.All in all, it was well written and held my attention."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Even people who say \"I only read nonfiction\" can enjoy this entertaining novel, which is rich with fascinating details about life in a traveling circus during Prohibition and the Depression. For example, circus members stocked up on booze in Canada and sneaked it across the border into the US  by storing it in the middle of the train car carrying camels, because camels spit, and customs agents didn't want to mingle with them. Against an unusual background, the fictional characters (humans and other animals) weave a story that keeps readers turning the pages."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For months, everytime I was in a bookstore - I found that I would gravitate toward this book, read the back and place it back on the shelf.  I should have listened to my instinct.  After many positive recommendations from friends and reading the reviews, I relunctantly check the book out at the local library.  I started reading with an open mind.  After about 200 pages, I phone my friend to ask her if I was missing something, because I just didn't care of the story and I couldn't seem to find a connection with any of the characters.  At this point, she instructed me to stop reading - \"because of you don't like it now, there isn't anything earth shattering that will happen that will make you change your mind.\"  I didn't listen, and she was right."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "There is a reason this book is so popular. Not only is a swift-moving adventure, a historical fiction, but it's a a love story about life. And, Sarah Gruen is extremely adept at vividly describing the interior life -- not only of the circus and circus life she so carefully researched but also the interior, psychological experience of her characters, including Jacob, the lead character -- even as an old man. She enters into his experience so deeply that it is impossible as a reader, not to as well! You see the nursing home, the circus, the animals, the rough competition, and the connection.Sarah Gruen has created a book which transcends the circus, and highlights the importance of life and living, no matter how old we are.This is indeed summer reading, and one of the best books I've read all year."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love this novel. I started reading a printed version, but I had a hard time distinguishing character voices as it was not always marked. And then there were alternating \"young\" and then \"old\" point of view chapters. Before giving up (because I have the same type of challenge when I read Amy Tan novels), I switched to the audio \"book on tape\" and LOVED the book. One of the best novels I've read. And the voice-over talent who read the audio version is a very, very good storyteller."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Excellent read! Ms. Gruen masters character and plot with beautiful prose. I remained captivated and found myself caring for the diverse cast.  Ms. Gruen successfully evokes a sense of the times, the desperate nature of survival during the Depression, as well as one's attempt to salvage one's sense of self as age betrays the body.  The storyline is suspenseful, true to period, and woven through with a touch of romance.  The setting is gritty and evokes the reality of Circus life on the road and  the behind-the-scenes work required to attain the magical world the public craves.  Well done!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to share it with others. All of my friends who've read it, love it as well. As you can tell from the near 5 star consensus from reviewers, this is a wonderful book, so I don't really need to go into a long drawn out review, but I will say that I loved the rich, interesting characters who felt like old friends by the end of the book and the story was engrossing and lovely - a true love story between lovers, between friends and between man and beast. And the total immersion into another world and time was just a bonus. You can't go wrong with this book!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love historical novels, and this is one of my favorites. The circus in the Great Depression era is a great setting for the underlying love story. The internal struggles the main characters go through are timeless, and highly resonate with our modern times, perhaps in part because both eras had economic hardship. The book is narrated by a 93 (or 96, as he can't remember his real age) man. His character is very well put together, very real. The book has an optimistic message of triumph over adversity and the value of friendship and true love."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants was a fantastic book.  Easy to read and interesting.  Most impressively, a topic that I never gave much thought to, Depression-Era travelling train circuses, was something I enjoyed reading about.  To be honest, I never knew there was such a topic.  Now I'm wondering if there are any Industrial Revolution cat juggling books out there that I should be reading.  Anyway, Gruen seemed to do a decent amount or research for the book, so I learned a little something about the topic.  The best part of the book was the fantastic ending.  More books should end like that."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was slow to start but once I got into it I could not put it down.  It twisted and turned all over the place.  It was such a relief despite some of the more depressing points that it had a great happy ending.  The author did a great job giving Rosie the elephant human characteristics.  I liked that it was told from the point of view of an older man looking back.  Even his ending to the story was an amazing one.  I would definantly recommend this book to a friend."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When this book is telling the story of the circus, it is fascinating, describing a world that most readers know nothing about. But, possibly in an attempt to make it more \"commercial\", the author has chosen to focus on the love story, which is predictable. In those scenes, fascination turns to boredom.Use all that research (described in detail at the end of the book), Ms Gruen, to tell us more stories of the roustabouts, performers, animals and freaks of the circus - and forget the \"plot\" and the soap!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I first heard about Water for Elephants as a project that began during NaNoWrimo a few years back when I was trying NaNoWrimo for the first time. It was inspiring to hear.Yet it took me years to get around to reading this book despite many recommendations.I LOVED it!The author did a lovely job of handling so many characters big and small. She kept solid control over their little quirks, tics, etc.I particularly enjoyed seeing everything first-person present through Jacob's eyes, but I do think he was more of a woman's man than a man's man. Not that I need him to be a boar or a brute, but he was a touch more on the emotional swing side than I generally like in male characters in stories of this ilk.Didn't really matter though, because the whole package of this tale enchanted me.Wholeheartedly recommend (but be prepared to be disappointed with the movie if you read the book first)."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was really eager to read this book after seeing all the great reviews for it.  However,  I started reading it and could not get into it.  The whole first half dragged for me, with not too much going on in the story. The writing was difficult to read at times, and I agree with some of the reviewers here, it often read as a screenplay which made it that much harder to get into.  But about halfway through the book, the plot starts moving and I actually end up finishing the book and I'm glad I did.  I'm still not sure why the book itself is getting rave reviews, but I am looking forward to seeing how the movie version of the book will turn out."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was recommended to me by a few different people.  I knew NOTHING about it when I went to pick it up.  I was hesitant at first.  I am not a fan of the circus at all.  But knowing that one of the friends that had recommended it is also not a fan of the circus, I was cautiously optimistic.I am glad that I gave it a chance.  It is a well written story that really draws a vivid picture for you.  A great reflection of the times with a love story that had me in tears in parts.  Highly recommend to all."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Possibly the best book I've read in nearly 20 years. An easy, yet difficult at the same time read, I found myself unable to put it down although there were parts so heart-wrenching, my eyes filled with tears throughout this realistically-written novel. Also, the movie based on this book is one of the very few which Hollywood did not completely destroy (but PLEASE read the book first!).And guys, this isn't just some flaky chick-lit...my boyfriend read it with me (HIS idea!), finished it first, then hounded me to hurry up and finish reading it so he could discuss it with me. And he doesn't usually take an interest in anything that's not Lord of the Rings-esque.So, go forth, read and enjoy-I own both the book and the Kindle version-either way, it's a winner."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants takes you to the time of the Great Depression on a circus train.  I was hesitating on reading this story because I thought it would be heartbreaking.  It's hard for me to read about animal cruelty and reading about a circus there is bound to be some ugly scenes.  There are some scenes that were hard to read, but for the most part I felt the author did spare us the raw details.  Sara Gruen knows how to write rich details in such a way that the circus jumped off the pages.  I felt like I was there surround by the sounds and smells of the circus.  I loved the characters and Rosie the elephant was the show stopper.  It was a pleasure reading this story and a huge plus for me that it had a happy ending."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Although the book jacket suggested the storyline as a love story, I truly became engrossed in the life in the circus.  After reading the novel, I had to go online and check out historical facts on circus stampedes, fires, and train wrecks. Being a part of the circus family in the 1930's was no easy or safe occupation.The characters are filled with depth, and Jacob, the protagonist, gives the reader a true insight to an honest and loyal man in his twenties and nineties.Maybe it's not always easy to put in words as to the \"whys\", but it's definitely a book you don't want to put down."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants captivates the reader with its deeply moving and touching storyline.It is charming,magical.... laced with sadness,humour,joy. The story of a young man who loses everything dear to him in this world and then finds meaning and happiness in the most unexpected and least likely place....a traveling circus. The book really brings to life the spirit and times of a traveling circus(set in the backdrop of the Great Depression). Its many colorful,unique characters vividly bring to life this largly forgotten bygone era.Water for Elephants is simply a pleasure to read.  The only drawback to the book is that there is quite a bit of cursing and several sexually explicit passages that might offend certain readers.If you can overlook or skip these rough spots you will certainly experience great pleasure in reading Water for Elephants."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. I'll probably only give a handful of five-star reviews. This and Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet are my favorite books from what I've read this past year, and I've done a lot of reading.  The story just sucked me in.  Usually when a book goes back and forth between past and present there is one time period I prefer over another.  I will trudge through the less preferred period of time just to get to the better part.  In this book, I enjoyed both past and present equally. It's just well done."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a beautiful story Sara has woven with \"Water for Elephants\".  It really made me reflect on how difficult it must be for elderly people to have lost most of their friends and loved ones and how them can only relive the memories of their lives.  This book was captivating--love, adventure,friendship, excitement, betrayal, and the special love between animals and humans--all rolled into one wonderful tale.  From the time I started reading it-it was all I could do to put it down--kept me awake reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore.I will definitely be keeping watch for any new books written by Sara Guren--she is a fantastic story teller."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have never read anything like this and I loved every page.  Very few books have actually made me gasp in shock.  There is so much about the traveling circus that is appalling yet intriguing at the same time.  And who knows what is fact and fiction?  Gruen blends the two beautifully.  I am now really interested to learn more about this era of the circus.  I read my copy in 3 days and have already loaned it out.  Trust me, this is a good book!  And so different from any story line I've ever read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The parts of this book that dealt with the main character in old age, were very insightful and I enjoyed that.  But quite honestly had I known that it would detail the abuse of the circus animals and then also the detailed sex acts I would never had purchased this.  I wish I knew how to delete it from my Kindle.  I also wish someone else had mention this in the reviews that I saw.  I NEVER stop reading a book, but had to quit about 35% of the way thru it, it was disgusting and I am not a prude.I would never recommend this book, nor will I venture to the movie."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Spolier Alert (kinda): I really enjoyed the reflection of the characters past and present. I found the love story to be a bit wishy washy.  when visting the main characters past I didn't really buy into the &#34;love at first sight&#34; idea. Not sure why, but I was asking why? Why did Marlena fall in love with Jacob? What made him stand out so much? It sounds bad that i say that, but I just didn't feel a spark between the characters. The whole damsel in distress was manufactured. Additionally, it was super convenient the way they ended up together in the end. Overall, I did enjoy the story and I was more drawn to the present version Jacob."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story alternates between present-day and flashbacks through the mind of our now 93-year-old main character.  The historical aspects of this book are incredibly well-researched and do a great deal to advance the plot of the story.  Unfortunately, the present-day scenes are rather dull.  I found myself skimming over those sections because I was eager to return to reading about Jacob's life working on the circus in the 1930s.The love story in this book - a tale of forbidden love between Jacob and Marlena, the married star of the big top show - is sweet, but ultimately predictable.  With the exception of one sharp twist, I felt that the love story ending of this novel is fairly cookie cutter.  That being said, I can't deny the fact that I was thoroughly entertained by every page."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was just pointless. I feel like I was reading a novel generated by a random plot generator which spit out a circus, an old guy and a young guy-- nothing had the tactical feel of reality in this book. It was mediocre at best. Even the title of the novel was anticlimactic, given that one of old Jacob's nursing home fellows said he used to carry water for elephants and then not mentioned again. This novel is devoid of anything making it worth reading: Complex plot? No; Mercurial characters? No; Insights into the human condition? No; Stupendous vocabulary and/or Joycean constructions with the English language? No. Instead, we are left with chapter after chapter of a book better suited as children's literature."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I found this book fairly well crafted, but did not believe in the characters or the story, which seemed awfully thin and contrived. The author admits in a postscript that she borrowed extensively from old newspaper stories and made up composite characters based on real-life people and animals, which is close to plagiarism if you ask me. The main character, Jacob, who is 93, and tell the story in flashbacks, is much too lucid for his age to be credible, and Marlena, the woman he eventually steals, comes across as flat and uninteresting.Like other reviewers, I found the dialogue artificial and at times anachronistic. Haven't seen the movie but not much source material to work with."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My good mate John down at Matilda's book store  in Mount Waverley ordered this book in for me and it would have to be my favourite novel so far this year.The reader is introduced to 90 something year old Jacob who is a resident in an Old Folk's Home. Jacob talks about his past beginning with not completing his Vet Exams and finding himself in a travelling cirus during the Depression Era in America. Beneath the tinsel and cotton candy you find that the circus consists of hard men who never thought twice about throwing anybody from a  moving train.There is brutality and violence in this book and also the search for dignity in this cold tough world. Naturally 5 stars for this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I could write a book about this book but will keep it short and simple.  This book tells a very entertaining story of Jacob (never referred to as \"Jake\" in the book) and a twist of fate that sees his fate aligned with a circus after his parents are killed.  It's a very engaging book, well written and enough to keep you reading into the wee hours of the night.  I can't imagine the movie could possibly keep up but may give it a shot.  I don't see Robert Pattison as Jacob necessarily.Great book!  And for those who seemed to think the book fell flat - you're digging too deep for meaning - relax and enjoy a good read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The strength of the book is its narrative flow. I particularly liked the little catch-words that usually connected the \"assisted living\" chapters with the circus chapters. Gruen generally wrote in such connections, and I found them both ingeniously crafted and useful in uniting the narrative.In addition to telling a great story, Gruen gives a remarkably detailed picture of the circus world of the 1930s. I had definitely never heard of a \"cooch tent\" before reading this book, for example, and Gruen's depiction of its solo practitioner is thoughtful, humane, and free of cliches. The ideas of circuses getting booted out of town, of people getting booted off the circus trains, and of entrepreneurs cannibalizing the remnants of failed circuses were also quite fascinating.To the extent that Gruen wanted to make an analogy to the biblical Jacob story by obscurely dropped hints and anagrammed names, I think, however, that she pushed too far. This novel stands nicely on its own without this type of symbolism or metaphor."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "After hearing so much hype about this book I quickly read it before the movie came out. I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't the super excited about it either. I liked the perspective from which the story was told - a feisty 90-something old man reflecting in flashbacks on his adventures in a travelling circus 70 years earlier, while lamenting the indignities of his current nursing-home existence.  Jacob Jankowski, just days from the final exams at Cornell University becoming a vet, had his world forever altered when his parents are killed in an auto accident. Alone, frightened and penniless, the 23 yr. old hops a train, never intending to &#8220;run away with the circus&#8221;. Harsh conditions at the circus and an insane animal trainer are some of the things Jacob has to contend with living his life with the circus."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book! I couldn't put it down! It was a bit \"fluffier\" reading than I originally thought it would be, but it was fabulous none-the-less. The descriptions are vivid, not cliched; the characters are interesting; and the weaving of present-day Jacob with the Jacob of a bygone era is delightful.I would call this a must read... not because it will change your life or make you think about the world around you, but because it is just so enjoyable. I gave it a 4.5 because it isn't a book that will make you think long after the last page is read, but it will make you sad you've left the colorful circus world of Jacob Jankowski."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had heard of this book for awhile and kept considering it but I hate to say it wasn't until I saw the trailer for the movie coming out soon that really caught my attention. So the next day I went out and bought it, starting it immediately. The story is extremely well written, with details that enabled me to picture how everything appeared in a big top circus during that time. You immediately connect with Jacob from the start as his journey continues, pulling for him page after page. The other characters are well written with the story, feeling the happiness, joy and sadness each of them feel as the story continues.It's really hard not to say too much without giving the story away. This is a book I will be recommending to everyone as it is a story that has a bit of everything wrapped into one- so many emotions page after page. Knowing the fate of most the characters at the end, you want more but already have an idea of how their story ends."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a wonderful story of a rag-tag bunch of people and animals, who just happened to be called a circus!  They traveled by train during the depression and had some fascinating adventures along the way.  We meet Jacob Jankowski, a young man who accidently lands  on the train.  He decides to stay and become the circus veterinarian.  He meets lovely Marlena and her evil husband, August.  Of course he falls in love with her, but the husband is a force to be reckoned with.  There is also Walter (Kinko)the clown, Big Al, Camel, and of course Rosie the Elephant.  The ending is extremely satisfying.  This book is well-researched and authentic.  I loved it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a good book about the circus (a comment I never thought I would ever make).  Jacob's story is heartbreakingly sympathetic.  Ms. Gruen's mastery of the circus vocabulary really sets the stage for the plotline.  A remarkable amount of reseach went into writing circus lore.  This is no Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth.  This is a downtrodden, edging ever closer to disaster circus run by the same type of people.  I must admit I had to skip anything that resembled animal cruelty (although I am sure it is factual).  My inability to deal with this led to my giving the book only 4 stars.  A reflection on the reviewer more than on the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Wow! Water for Elephants was recommended by a friend of mine. She loved the book so much, she bought it for me. I am happy she did!! This story was heartfelt, mind blowing, awesomely good!!!!!! Sara definitely has a masterpiece on her hands. Jacob and Marlena' s life, Rosie, all the crew, and other animals. What they went through and how they end up. I loved and cried. Camel and Walter, so sad. Water for Elephants is A must read!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have to admit I did not finish it. It was simultaneously boring, cliched, badly written and trite. Oh and repetitive. The only redeeming feature of the book was the parts where Jacob was an old man. If the author could write like that more consistently then she would be on to something. I cannot figure out why people love this book so much. If you compare it to another recently very popular book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, at least that book was riveting, even though it was also not very well written. I am not looking for Faulkner, but if a book is not high literature it should at least have a compelling plot. This book had neither neither good writing style nor an interesting plot. Don't waste your time."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It honestly took me weeks to finally talk myself into buying this book, I just said screw it and did it. I started reading it and could not put it down. By far my favorite book. (this month anyhow) I love to read the books before I see the movie and even though 9 out of 10 times I am very disapointed with the movie I honestly can not wait to see this movie! I think that the book was so real and made me feel like part of the circus so much that watching the movie will make me feel even more so part of the circus. I passed this book along to a \"reading buddy\" of mine and told her just read it! She text me the next day and said she had just finished it and it was SOOOOOO GOOD (This girl in not one to read a book in a day) If you are reading these reviews trying to descide weather to buy this or not by suggestion is.... Just buy it! Well worth the money!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book at the recommendation of a client...I loved it!  I read this book quite some time ago about two years ago and still think about some of the characters.  While reading this book, I often found myself so deep in the story, I could smell the smells and hear all of the people talking.  I want to see the movie as I am sure it will be entertaining, my only concern outside of the obvious, (if you read a lot you will agree it is a rare movie that can compare to the book).  I  so enjoyed this book and I would be disappointed if the characters were not portrayed as beautifully on the big screen as I have them in my mind.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a beautifully written story that is sure to stay with you long after the final page."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book.  It was sometimes hard to read, when Rosie the elephant was being beaten, for example, but overall, it was so incredibly good.  One point that bothered me, though.  WHY did the author NOT have Jacob turn back and look for Walter???  Just because the other men said he \"probably did not survive the night\" does not mean he didn't.  At very least Jacob SHOULD have gone back and found out for sure, especially since Walter had done a lot of good for him.  That was the only part of the book I felt let down by, although I still loved the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was nothing short of amazing. From the first page to the last, I did not want to put it down and when it ended, I was sad it was over. One of the things that makes the book so strong is the characters. from Jacob to August to \"Rosie\", there isn't a character that I did not feel moved by at one point or another.There is a dark side to the circus life and this book will show you things you never imagined that happen outside the Big Top. So, if you are going to buy one book this year, make it this one."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I am not quite sure how to rate this book.  It was a book club pick or I probably would not have read it.  I picked it up and put it down countless times before I could actually finish it.  I just could not get past the animal cruelty scenes.  Plus I am probably one of a minority of people that do not believe animals are here for our entertainment.  The fact that they were and still are, I am sure, in many third rate circuses/traveling zoos mistreated makes it all the more heartbreaking for me.  I had to give the book stars for the scenes involving Jacob in his old age and also for making you care about the characters.  I cried over Walter's fate.  The author also took pity on me and at least made me think some of the animals received a better fate and future.  I keeping thinking about Rex though..........."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was practically forced to read this book by my partner, who loved it and would not stop insisting that I had to read it. I offered lots of excuses as I put it off, but the truth is, I couldn't care less about the circus. When I finally gave in and started reading Water for Elephants, I realized on the first page that my apathy for the circus didn't matter.This was a touching, clever, totally unexpected story. It offers a window into how we treat the elderly, animals, and people of a different class, without ever being preachy. There were times when I feared it would become a depressing wallow, but that never happened. The unexpected upswing at the end was particularly satisfying. A great read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a fun story, cleverly delivered as Jacob moves back in time to relive his story and returns to the present, his disgruntled present.  Some critics have complained about the ending, but I'd have to say they are Bah, humbug critics.  The ending is delightful, one of the best ever. This is a feel good story and it IS fiction, so the complainers, IMO, just don't understand Suspended disbelief.  The story is magical in its authentic setting and making you feel you are under the big top. It is sometimes shocking, sometimes painful, always compelling. Don't miss this one.  ...Karleene Morrow, author of Destinies, a novel."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A man in a nursing home relives his younger years as a vet for a circus. To this reader, not a very compelling premise, yet once I read the first paragraph I was instantly hooked. By the second chapter, I had grown so attached to the main character that I truly felt for the things that happened to him. The story is told in rich, vivid prose, capturing each character so well that they soon became my friends and enemies, depending on the character. This book addresses a wide range of human experiences in a tasteful manner in which this reader was left in a pensive, awe-struck mood contemplating far more important questions and ideas about human existence. It also needs to be noted that this book is extremely well researched and bases its story around actual happenings in Circus history."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I don't think this story could have been any better than it was. I read it front to back in one sitting. I just couldn't put it down! I don't read reviews before I read a book, I'll read anything I can get my hands on. When I got this book I flipped through it, and I didn't think I'd like it because of the pictures. But after the FIRST page I was hooked. I LOVED LOVED LOVED Jacob and Marlana...and HATED Uncle Al and August. I wanted to cry everytime Auggie went to the tent to lay it on Rosie. It made me sick. It's been a while since I read something so moving! A+++++++++"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen's gorgeous new novel, 'Water For Elephants,' unfolds as a dual narrative, alternating between Jacob Jankowski's life as a nonagenarian, and his time spent working for a ragtag Depression-era circus as a young man. The plot is captivating (I missed two meals because I didn't want to put the book down) and Gruen's writing, as always, is transcendent. She deftly evokes a fascinating period in American history that deserves to be revisited, and her characters--human and animal alike--will stay with you long after you turn the last page."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book last year and am sincerely hoping that the movie is able to sufficiently capture the adventure, romance, and poignancy.  I not only enjoyed the flashbacks to the days in the circus - I REALLY enjoyed the perspective of the character in a current day nursing home.  This book has it all and is written in a way that it easily became a movie in my mind as I read.  Many times books like this have sad endings but the ending to this story is excellent!  I highly recommend this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a fantastic story.  Jacob Jankowski is a 93 year old man.  When the circus pays a visit to the lot across from the Nursing Home he lives in, it takes him back to when he was employed by a circus during the depression.  And so the book alternates between today and the 1930's.  This book grabbed me from the beginning.  Especially since Jacob attended school at Cornell and caught the circus train on it's way to Utica.  Places I am very familiar with.  The fact that he is Polish is another plus.  This story is put together very well.  Gruen obviously did her research and I finish this book with some knowledge about Jamaica ginger paralysis, exotic animal behavior and of course, the circus.  It is definitely going on my personal list of \"classics\" and \"1001 books to read before you die\"."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I don't know how I've missed this one---it is such a powerful, emotional read.  Make sure you have your Kleenex handy because Water for Elephants is a tear-jerker.The story is told in the first person with Jacob as the narrator.  The story switches from Jacob in his nineties in the nursing home to Jacob in his twenties during his circus days.  Sometimes alternating perspectives can get choppy but Sara Gruen gets the pacing just right.Water for Elephants is about a traveling circus, but it is mostly a love story---or at least it was for me.  Fans of historical fiction, or readers just wanting an engrossing story will love this one.Just One Gripe:It can get a little graphic at times.The Best Thing About This Book:I loved the ending."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've decided I just can't finish this book. The main character is a 23-year old male, but c'mon - I just don't appreciate some of the details the author is having him describe and they are totally unnecessary to the story. I've read almost nine chapters and decided I don't need any more images like the explicit strip scene, the details of a graphic \"8-pager\", and I certainly didn't need the picture of what the dwarf is doing alone on his cot while looking at the graphic magazine. It's a big disappointment because the story is actually interesting and I want to find out what happens but not badly enough to wade through the sludge. I don't think I've been this disappointed in a story since the ending of Angela's Ashes."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book from cover to cover, and I'm glad I did.  But I thought it was very sad, because of the old man in the nursing home narrating the book, because of the animal abuse to the elephant and other species, and because of the spousal abuse to the elephant rider.  Oh, there were elements of humor, friendship, love, and happiness.  The ending was good as well as unexpected.  Still, if I had to describe this book in just one word, it would be \"sad.\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I know there are hundreds of reviews for this book, but I liked it so much, I just had to add mine. I usually read a book before seeing the movie. I fing that the book is generally better than the movie. This book was amazing. I felt like I was living in a real circus. I am also a nurse, so can identify with the main character in a nursing home. Nursing home people are so very lonely. anyway, this is a real story, like the ones you were told when you were young. It took me back and made me feel like I was truely there. You have to read it. Maybe I'll see the movie now.barbara"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Despite haunting cover art and a great title, despite obvious research and well thought out prose, and despite the fact that this book is the darling of the Independent Booksellers Association, I felt let down.  Part of the problem was that I expected a lot and had held this book on my shelf, until I could really savor it.  It does start out strong, and Gruen keeps her time periods well separated.  But the characters, especially the narrator, feel stock and unfinished and merely devices on which to hang the proceeds of research.  Because of the plusses of the book enumerated in the opening sentence of my review, I give 3 stars, but for the back story, it would be fewer."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Loved it! Absolutely loved it! The story was sweet, complicated and funny at times and it didn't leave me hanging. The story was completed and I love that! So many books leave you without finishing what was started and I liked that this one didn't. You find out exactly where the characters end up. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I could've done without the nursing home flashbacks, and I felt that the elderly Jacob's personality didn't match the younger Jacob's personality. At times i wished the whole book was set in the circus days, but then I feel like the reader wouldn't have gotten the sense of closer that comes with knowing where the character ends up in life.Overall, a wonderful story! I highly recommend it, and hope the movie doesn't ruin it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was enchanting.  Immediately you become under it's spell from the first words. The mystery, history, action, and love stories of the circus all wrapped up in one.The story is about Jacob Jankowski, the circus vet.  Under tragic circumstances, he joins a second rated circus and becomes entangled into all their lives, whether he wants to or not.  Bouncing between his current status, which is in a nursing home at the age of 93 or 99 (he's not sure) and his circus life, there is a mystery deep in the heart of it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book.  I could not put it down, because I was in such suspense about what would happen next.  I particularly love the storyline of the character as an old man in a nursing home - having worked in nursing homes, the descriptions are spot on.  I laughed out loud at his antics, and cried when characters I had grown to love were lost to tragedy.  I have never read a book where an elephant is a main character and pivotal to the story.  All I can say is \"WOW.\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I saw this book in the bookstore and it sounded very interesting so I got it out of the library. I wasn't disappointed. It was very easy to read and flowed nicely. Very interesting and quirky characters which I liked. Rosie the elephant was a great character. I agree with one of the other reviewers who compared the book to Sophies Choice. I thought the same thing when we meet the ringmaster. I really enjoyed the book but I was disappointed that there were a couple of parts that were unnecessarily crude (as opposed to necessarily crude?). It's like the female writer of the book had to prove that she could be as crude as any man. Other than that, it was one of my favourite books this year."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm not one to read historical pieces, mostly because I don't think I'll relate to the people and times, but this book is an exception. An exceptional exception! I loved \"Water for Elephants.\" Tragedy, mystery, adventure, humor and romance -- this book has it all. This is the story of a young man who finds himself working as a veterinarian for a traveling circus during the Great Depression era, but it's really so much more. So, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and enjoy this masterpiece!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Never having been particularly interested in all things circus-y, I put this book back on the bookstore shelf more than once. But an Amazon review of another, quite unrelated novel referenced this book so I picked up a copy. Really glad I did. This is a well-paced novel that doesn't fall into the trap of doubling as a documentary on the early twentieth century circus trade. It is engaging, romantic, with sufficient drama and excitement to keep the pages turning over well into the night. Maybe at times a little cute, but a solid four-star effort."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My daughter has been asking me to read this book for years.  I resisted because I read the synopsis and thought \"a story about a circus in the era of the great depression? Nah.\"  I finally downloaded it and gave it a go and couldn't put the book down.  Seriously this is one of the best books I've read in years!  I felt like I was right there.  The narrative shifts back and forth between old Jacob and young Jacob seamlessly.  I strongly regret waiting so long to read this book.  And for you Nook/Kindle lovers, this book is only $5 to download.  I would have paid full price.  It is a haunting story and often had me thinking of my own aging.  What will it feel like to be inside a body that is old and doesn't function like it used to, yet the mind still feels young?  I can't wait for the movie to come out in April."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished this book, and oh my word, what a fun, very quick read :-)  The story was wonderful and I loved the back and forth from the \"old\" Jacob to the \"young\" Jacob, the the past reality, to the current reality.The detail of the writing was so descriptive that I felt like I was in the hobo \"city\" or seeing the high trestle that Walter & Camel were thrown off of. It was just an amazing story, I'd suggest it to anyone, at any age."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wasn't sure about this - circus and elephants and all. I was afraid it was going to be about animal abuse and very sad. Well - there is that, but it's so much more than that. You'll be transported to a different time and a location most of us will never experience - the backdoor view of a circus. Each character is so real, I felt I could regonize them.  And although I wasn't even around when the story took place - at least the early part, I could picture everything right down to the smells and sounds! The author has a terrific grasp of aging as well. Sympathetic but not syrupy. The aged Jacob is quite a character as he struggles with the indignities associated with 'assisted' living and the recollections of a past - recollections that he was just now ready to reveal at age 90 or was that 93?"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I recently finished reading Water for Elephants.  The historical elements in this novel were carefully researched which made for a thrilling book.  I loved the way the story was told by an elderly man living in a nursing home and it bounced back and forth between timelines.  You fell in love with the grumpy man and you think about what the elderly actually feel like when they are forced to live in places like this. His story is touching and you really get to know all of the characters.  The elephant is a sweetheart and it's amazing how smart she is.  Great book and look forward to seeing the movie to see how well it was done."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "\"Water For Elephants\" paints a runaway's story of joining the circus, interspersed with an old man's sad realities.  Bringing to life colorful characters that abound in the time of the train circus, Gruen strikes a balance between the despondency of the 1930s and the timelessness of hope and longing, both in the past and present.  An easy coming-of-age  must-read to curl up by the fire with!(I can't say I'm surprised that the book is being turned into a movie, though it'll be interesting to see if the movie manages to capture the poignancy of the old man's recollections...)"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had no desire whatsoever to read this book until I saw a trailer for the movie. The tailer caught my eye and since books are always better then the movie I took a chance and found that I thought it was a great story. The story felt real. It's a very believeable read and I liked that it wasn't sugar coated. It held my interest and taught me a lot about circus life in that time period. The ending completely caught me off guard. Water for Elephants is a story that will stay with me forever. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Just finish reading this last night around 1 A.M.Good BookOne of those stories told by going back and forth between past and present. I love books written that way.Anyway the story is about a young veterinary student who falls into terrible misfortune and with few options joins a travelling circus, The (unscrupulous) Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Time period is in the 1920's or 30's, during The Great Depression. Narrated by an old man, 90 or 93 he says. Who is (unhappily) living out his days at a nursing home. Ah but he wasn't always an old man.The book appears to have been carefully researched and many of the characters and incidents are based on actual people, animals and or occurrences in circus of times past.At times funny, sad, heartbreaking yet hopeful this one will stay with me for a long while. I highly recommend it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It had excellent character development and I had to keep reminding myself that it was fiction.  Since hearing about the dreadful Hartford circus fire from my mother (who had friends perish), I have always found it to be such an interesting topic.  This bridged the gap from story to reality by referencing some of the real aspects of the circus by utilizing that backdrop with an interesting storyline.  I cannot wait until the next book!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The historical story was interesting and kept my attention, even though I think TOO MANY people here are giving Ms. Gruen too much credit.  Personally, I don't think she used enough historical fact and instead relied on a very formulaic plot-line that was very predictable, i.e. the love relationship, the MC and head of the animals will be foiled in the end, and the preposterous ending where our dear wonderful elephant kills the cruel animal director.  Too contrived for me.I can understand the popularity of this book.  I cannot understand why it's a runaway bestseller."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was afraid I was not going to be able to relate to this book as it begins when Jacob is ninety, or nienty three.  I assumed it was going to be about dealing with age and death, and, boy, was I wrong!  As soon as I started this book, I could not put it down.  I love how it hops from old Jacob to young Jacob.  It has mystery, love, suspense, and death...just to name a few.  It was so much more than the \"easy read\" I thought I picked up.  The characters had such depth, and you could truly feel their emotions. Who would have thought I would be so interested in the going-ons of circus life, but this book draws you in and makes you never want to leave the \"big top\"."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "After all the hype about this book, I finally gave in to reading a borrowed copy. I wanted to like it, truly I did.  I made it to page 164 with some effort.  The characters were not developed well enough for me to like them.  Also, I work with elderly people and the narrator as an elderly man was not altogether believable.What I did enjoy was learning a bit about the circus business  back in the 30s.Please if you know of some real 5-star novels, non-romance, let me know."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I could not put this book down.  Maybe it's because I love history, and this novel is so very rich with it. Or maybe it's because I've always been a hopeless romantic, rooting for people who shouldn't be in love to find their happy ending.  Or maybe it's my penchant for heroes who are thrust into unfamiliar territory, in this case the circus world, and have to find their way.  Whatever...this book stayed with me long after I finished it, and that's the best kind of read of all."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I do!  The story had me hooked - I felt like I was a part of this exotic traveling troupe and despite the horrors and sadness in it, I couldn't be pulled away.  Especially heart-rending was the author's detailed depiction of the heavy-laden post-depression days and what one tragedy can do to a person: turn his life upside down. The storyline had my emotions wrapped up in the circus, and in the next moment, broke my heart for the lonely old man in a nursing home.  Excellent read that pulled me in and caught my breath."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The various characters made this story interesting.  Each brought a part of every day life.  Some were misjudged.  I did not like the fact that one could not trust anyone well unless he/she were very well acquainted with each person.  the story was fascinating and circus life was presented as hard work, low pay, and no home for many.  I would recommend this book to imaginative spirits, and to those who trust and judge too easily and quickly.  There were some tender parts that were a relief from all the cheating."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a pleasure to have such a fascinating book  read to me by two great readers! The main character, a 93 year old man recounting his life is read by an actor whose rough, gravelly voice perfectly embodies the character. The main character, as a 23 year old, is read by a much younger actor. Together, these two readers turned this book into an unforgettable novel.Maybe the book is every bit as good as a read, but having had heard it on CD, that's the way I'd recommend you discover it, too!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book from beginning to end. Along with some entertaining history, this is a beautifully woven tale.  To my mind, a good novel has unexpected twists and surprises .. and this book carried one beautiful surprise all the way through.This book stirred in me an affection for elephants that I hadn't felt since childhood.  Along with The Magician's Elephant by Kate DiCamillo, Water for Elephants helped to inspire the painting \"The Gentle Somnambulist\" which is included in my bookTREASURE Twenty One Paintings and a Key."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water For Elephants was an excellent book detailing what life was like for those who worked for the circus during the Depression era and later.  This wonderful story was told in flashback by a crotchety ninety-year old, man named, Jacob who lives in a nursing home.Other reviewers have already summarized the story very well. Therefore, I just want to add that I especially enjoyed Water For Elephants specifically because it was told from the perspective of an elderly individual who, in telling the circus-days story of his youth, also gave the reader a realistic perspective of aging.  For me, this was what made Sara Gruen's novel all the more compelling.For those who have elderly family in nursing homes, I would recommend that you read this book to your love one. I'm sure they will enjoy it as much as you!Maizie Lucille JamesJanuary 13, 2012"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had such a love hate relationship with this book. I struggled in the beginning that I even wanted to read it, but with all the hype and the movie coming out I figured I should trudge on. Overall, I'm glad I did. After a certain part there really are no dull moments, and lots of plot twists. The writing and character development is phenomenal, although there were a lot of graphic parts that I thought could've been left out and made me not want to continue sometimes (and I'm pretty tough). Towards the end I was flying through it and cannot wait to see how they pull off the movie!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I am not sure what I see all the hype about for this book but it was a pageturner, I'll give it that. The writing was very well done as Jacob told his tale of being in the circus all these years later in a nursing home, forgotten and old in body, not in mind.The life of the circus was clearly visible while reading this story as was the life in a nursing home. At first I was more interested to have the chapters go back to the present because the past was so horrible to witness but then his present life wasn't that cozy either.The ending was the best part of the book, for me, as it was most tender. It wasn't a bad read but not an entertaining one."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "At the time of this review there are over 1,700 reviews posted so I won't bother to sum up the story but just my opinion of the book.I thought the book was simple to read, an interesting story and engaging characters.Even though this novel is not perfect and a standard \"boy meets girl\" story with a charming setting, the descriptions are colorful and the characters are a variety of misfits; but somehow it all works and comes together very nicely for an entertaining and well paced read.Granted, the book is not going to be put on a shrine of the scholarly literary Olympus, but to me this book felt as if I was reading a fairytale - and I tremendously enjoyed it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I spent most of this book wondering why Gruen chose to intersperse her primary story of a young man who found himself thrust into the circus life in 1931 with the musings of that same man at the age of 93.  The story of how Jacob came to be in the circus and what happened to him there seemed like enough to me, and Jacob's aged voice seemed unnecessary.  At the end of the book, though, I realized why she gave us both perspectives, and could hardly argue with her narrative device, as the closure it provides works so well."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book is just a fun read. Nothing deep or realistic about the story. Nothing to be learned. No point. Just entertainment. Don't expect to connect with any of the characters because they are totally unrealistic. This book is just pure fantasy, almost childish. I did find the book worth reading, not a waste of time because it is entertaining. However, am I compelled to buy another book from this author? Probably not. Am I going to recommend it to my friends? Probably so with the disclaimer that it is a light fun read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I liked the ending of this book better than any other part. This mans life after the death of his parents was hard, as expected. It dragged on for me, until the end when he was living his last years of his life in a nursing home. his children disregarded him emotionally. They went to visit, but real interest in him was gone. They did their duty. He escapes in the end and lives out his life with the circus. The place where he lived most of his life after his parents death.It was good, not great for me."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Gruen's novel is the story of one man's life.  It is presented both as a recollection of a 93 year old man reflecting on his youth, as well as the current story of the matured man.  The central story revolves around a character that drops out of school after a family tragedy.  Being the depression and few work opportunities available, the character finds himself working with a circus.  The author clearly researched the subject and provides historical photos to provide the reader assistance with the visualization.  Overall, the book was enjoyable up until the last chapter.  I feel like I would have been much happier if the author left this chapter off all together as it in implausible and affected my entire view of the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'd never read anything by Sarah Gruen before and I'd heard a lot of hype about this book due to the release of the movie. I decided to hold off watching the film until I'd had a chance to see for myself how the book was.I'm so glad I waited.This book had me from it's opening pages all the way to the close. The descriptions of life in a traveling circus were gritty and made me feel as if I were really on that train, traveling with Jacob, Walter, and Camel. Ms. Gruen's character developments were also incredible, and as a writer myself, I found myself wishing I had one iota of her talent for bringing them to life so vividly.The story is well paced, with just hints from the elder Jacob as to how his life turned out. I liked the transition from old voice to young and felt as if I could \"see\" the character both ways.All in all, a fantastic read!Nephilim"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a WONDERFUL book about a slice of American life that not many people know about.  What was circus life like during the Depression? Don't let the topic discourage you from reading this book.  I was captured by the first line: \"I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other.\"  As I was reading this book, I could see the whole story play out in my mind as the author easily transitioned the storyteller from the present day back to the 1930's and his life on a circus train.  I can't say enough good things about this book.  Read it....It's a true winner!!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Did I only read this because it is supposed to have been a NaNoWriMo book? Yes. Does Sara Gruen mention that \"fact\" ANYWHERE in the book acknowledgments, on her website or in interviews? No. (Although she doesn't contradict the claim, which has been made very publicly by one of NaNoWriMo's founders.) Was it still worth the read? Meh. I don't know. I guess. Whatever. It wasn't a waste of time to read it, but it didn't enrich me or leave me with any lingering thoughts or feelings about the book. As a matter of fact, I barely remember what it was about (I want to say circuses?). All in all, it was a zero balance book. Some good footnotes though. I'd definitely recommend those.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."}

{"label": 5, "raw": "This book definitely is number one on my list of favorite books (and I read A LOT).  The story is gripping, beautiful and a little sad in some parts.  It's one of those books that you start reading then constantly stop in the middle of whatever you're doing to read \"just one more chapter\".  The writer doesn't leave the reader hanging, wondering what happened to all of the characters but it's not a predictable ending.  Read this book, you will not regret it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I felt like a bouncing ball in a porn shop rolled onto a circus train!  Between the poor character development to the stampede and the over dramatized porn and superficial sex scenes, I can honestly say that I would NOT recommend this book.  (Oh, and during the stampede, ALL these animals were in the big tent at the same time? without handlers? Why would Rosie be chained in the big tent during a show?)One of the primary editorials  states: \"Jacob is the only person in the book who has a handle on a moral compass and as his reward he spends most of the novel beaten, broken, concussed, bleeding, swollen and hungover.\"Believe me, he may have started out as a moral compass, but he went down hill fast until he had no morals left."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I can't really say anything that hasn't been said already by the other people who enjoyed this book. There's a reason this book has so many reviews, and it's a good reason. The story sucks you in from the start, and Jankowski remains sharp even when he gets older as evinced by the scenes in present day. Jankowski is a well-made character and the story is as believable as it is engaging. I'd rate this ten stars if I could, but I'm willing to settle for 5 as it's all Amazon will let me do :)"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have to say that I was skeptical about reading this book.  A friend of mine talked me into downloading it onto my Kindle...and well...I finished the book in two days.  I wasn't sure about reading about a circus, but it is also a bit of a love story (nothing intense).  I found the book easy to read and I loved the fact that the book goes back to the past and then to the present with the main character (an older man maybe ninety or ninety three) in a nursing home with a sense of humor. I will recommend this book to my friends."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For years, \"A Prayer For Owen Meany\" was my favorite book.  Until I read \"Water For Elephants\" for the first time.  I turned the last page and started all over again on page 1. I read it again after that.  I just love every sentence.  Jacob is a hoot!  The ending is the best ending ever!  Totally unexpected and totally true to character.  I live in Chicago, so the Chicago connection was one more sweet moment.  It's just such an all around loving, joyful book, with quirky surprises at every turn.  It made me laugh out loud.  I can't help it . . . I love everything about it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I purposely read Water for Elephants very slowly because I didn't want it to end. I thought the story was imaginative and magical, the characters vivid, and Gruen really brought the gritty 1930s circus atmosphere to life. I rarely re-read books, only because there are so many others to read, but this one I will re-read. One reviewer said it's just a notch above standard chick-lit, and I couldn't disagree more. This is literature. It's a fairy tale for grownups, and I mean that as high praise."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a wonderful story! It is all at once funny, heart-breaking, and thought-provoking. I found myself so absorbed in the story that when I had to stop reading in the course of a day I was disoriented for a few minutes before I could deal with my real life. That, to me, is a sign of a great book. I loved how seamlessly the narrative moved between Jacob as an old man of ninety, or ninety-three, and the young Jacob especially. There were no odd stops and starts and no chunks of time missing between past and present. And the end had me flipping back to the beginning to see if I read it right the first time (but in a good way)! Absolutely wonderful!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is one of those books that I've been hearing about ever since it came out. In an age-old storyline, the main character ends up working with a beautiful and charming woman, and the only problem is her cruel but powerful husband - the twist here is that the whole thing is set in a traveling circus. The characters were interesting, the story engaging and not too terribly predictable, but I thought my respect for it suffered from because it had been so highly rated - I find it much easier to read a book without any preconceived notions of how much I will like it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was an engaging story from start to finish. The author did a wonderful job telling Jacob Jankowski's story as an old man biding his time in an assisted living facility waiting to go to the circus, and as a young adult, who after finding himself homeless and parentless, jumps a circus train.I found the ending a bit surprising, but beautiful all the same. This was an easy read and something I couldn't put down. I love it when an author is truly able to bring you back to a time and place and make it so believable as Sara Gruen has done with Water for Elephants.Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Given the number and quality of this book's other reviews on this site, I'll keep my comments short.  When a reader has a book that contains an otherwise unfamiliar setting made familiar though amazingly extensive detail, fully developed characters, a strong storyline, and subtly woven literary themes, they have a great book.  Water for Elephants is such a book.  Gruen's novel is proof that the combination of exhaustive research and solid writing makes an unforgettably stunning book.  This is one instance where the number of positive reviews don't lie:  Water for Elephants is worth reading."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've just finished the book and liked it a great deal. Some of the research which underpins the book was outstanding. Depression era circuses, train circuses as Ms Gruen calls them, being a hobo on the rails, the brain of an elephant and the thread about Jamaican Ginger - all were fascinating - as was the almost seamless blending of the two time periods. Clearly the lady can absorb large quantities of research information and transform that into an excellent novel. She clearly, and obviously, loves animals. Will I buy the two other books listed here on Amazon? I don't think so but I am sure that horse lovers will and should."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book captured my attention from the start. I love how the author melds the geriatric version of Jacob and the younger version so well. The narrator is in constant reflection and delves deep into the emotional states of almost all involved, including that of the animals. As the geriatric version of Jacob looks into the mirror, he can no longer recognize any part of himself. He tries to look beneath the sagging skin and bruising and still nothing. This lets us know what he is really missing and that it is what a person does, that defines them.  If you can no longer do the things you love, then who are you? As Jacob finally realizes what he really needs, we can more clearly see throughout his entire struggle, what kept him so drawn in and how relationships with strangers can be stronger than that of family. Perfect ending!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is a book narrated by the memories of an old man in a nursing home flashing back to his life as a young vet on a travelling circus. Its based in the 1930s when the circus travelled by train into towns, to show off sideshow freaks and animal shows.What can I say about this book, it just didn&#8217;t grab me really and was a bit of a disappointment. The way it was written was very plain English and didn&#8217;t hold my attention or amuse me with the words. The talk about the animals and circus life was interesting and well researched. But the love story just wasn&#8217;t believable &#8211; the beautiful starlet falling for the pimply red headed virgin boy &#8211; nope don&#8217;t buy it sorry!I would recommend this book for animal lovers, young teens and the older generations as it has a mix from both sides of the story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is a small step up from chick-lit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it's what you're looking for.  A great read for the beach, or a good light read in-bewteen heavier or darker novels.As mentioned in other reviews, the character development was on the poor side, and the plot was pretty predictable (kind of hokey).  I felt the reading level was quite low, which made it a quick read, but not the brightest one.  Everything was pretty spoon-fed to the reader...there was no need for me to think about anything.  I prefer a bit more of a challenge."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had this book in my TBR pile and really wasn't in any sort of hurry to read it. Now, after finishing it, I can't believe I waited so long.This book gives me an in depth account of circus life during the depression and of the lifestyles of those who traveled with it. I learned a lot. I however, got really emotional when aspects of the book dealt with animal cruelty and even human cruelty to each other.This is a must read book. The ending is also a surprise."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants took me by surprise. This book was really well-written. Not only does this author know how to tell a story, she educates the reader without making it unreadable. She seamlessly wove the main characters story around the unknown story of circus life during 1930s. She offers a glimpse of animal treatment, different types of jobs within and the classes that separate the workers, the expectations given by towns on entertainment, prohibition, etc. The research is evident and I welcomed and looked forward to it. The book does have romance but it has so much more depth so I read freely, not really anticipating the story between the hero and the heroine.Sara Gruen has made me a fan and has given me hope for modern writers."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sure it is a well researched book.  The detail and description of circus life is very realistic and at times downright disgusting.  But what else does this book have that made one of my friends rave that this was the best book she had every read.  I'll tell you what....nothing.  I partly read this book on the recommendation of friend but I also wanted to read it because it was described as a murder mystery book.  A mystery murder it is not and by the end of this book I wanted all of the main characters to go away too!  I won't spill any beans but frankly this book deserved less time on the best seller's list and more time on the bottom of my discard pile (the books I will never read again or books that I would like to forget).  You make up your mind."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was recommended to me a 1000 times just by everybody (including Amazon). The thing is I thought it was going to be really depressing: a circus (they really depress me), great depression era.... and when I started reading it.... an old man in a home. Well, I finally thought, ok I HAVE to read it, at least to see why everybody is so in love with it, and now I am one of those people recommending it to everyone!Sara Gruen obviously has the gift of being a true story-teller, she just makes you read page after page completely forgetting your surroundings. The story is original, it has a drama and a force that absorbs you into it.If you want to have a great time reading or are looking for a special gift for someone: BUY THIS BOOK!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had to force myself to finish this and was continually disgusted with the animal cruelty. Maybe I should have stuck w/the gut instinct that I don't usually care for historical fiction? Gruen's insight into the minds of the aging is wonderful - she should have written something focusing on that. This book could also have been about 75 pages shorter and was painfully slow at times. The writing was not \"stellar\" - I just don't see all the hype but for the millions that loved it I'm glad for you - just be prepared if you haven't read it to wince w/some of the scenes."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book in about a week and a half and I don't have much time to read. After the negative reviews, I was waiting for it to let me down but I never got there. I was interested through the whole thing and wanted to know what was going to happen next.I read it for a book club selection and was happy with the book. Not sure I want to see the movie depending on what I hear about the animal abuse. I don't think I could take it.Great read and I will recommend to others."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book in September 2007. That means I had it in my drawer for almost five years and I just kept postponing reading it (I bought it along with many other books and it took me a while to read them all; then other books got on the way and so on).  When the movie came I refused to watch it knowing I should read the book first. And so I finally made up my mind and did it. It's a great book. I'm not a circus fan but the love story is precious. It was interesting to read about the Great Depression and how hard it was to make a living. I liked the pictures inside the book. I think they were a nice touch from the author. And of course I rented the movie and watched it after reading the book. Guess what? The book is better!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you want to feel the sorrow and excitement of joining the circus and the sorrow of old age in our country, Ms. Gruen could not have crafted a better story.  The protagonist, a Polish vet student, of all things, joins the circus and therein begins the story of corrupt managment, the wonderful animals and the class system among the workers and the performers.  The reader is provided with historical information while the author paints a vivid picture of the circus train and its dynamics.  She interweaves a touching love story and a strong respect for circus animals, espcially Rosie, the elephant who only understood Polish commands! Read it - you won't be wasting your time."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When this book came out in hardcover, I passed it by.  No interest in reading about circus freaks.  When the book came out in paperback, I passed it by.  Still did not sound interesting.  Three people recommended it to me and then, finally, a friend gave it to me after she finished it.  Still, I waited a month or so before beginning it.  Within the first few chapters, I was intrigued.  I loved the descriptions - created a definite picture in my mind.  I loved the characters - I wanted to know what would happen to them.  Although I thought the end was somewhat predictable, on the whole, I found this a very enjoyable read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book in a day. I simply could not put it down. It was so dark, with just a touch of goodness, which in itself was even complex. The love aspect of the story was so muddied, and heart wrenching, it made me feel for Jacob and for Marlena. How confusing it all was.Plus this story is based around a lifestyle we never hear about...a traveling circus. I loved Jacob, Marlena, and animals and even began to love Kinko.This book is by far a favorite, and so captivating."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed this book; it was like an interesting history lesson or a memoir and I learned a lot about the horrors of living with the circus in the early 20th century. The relationships weren't as well developed as I like, neither were the characters. But the variety of characters made the story very interesting. The concept of Jacob as as old man remembering the circus is a good idea, but I didn't like Jacob as an old man; he was grumpy, self-centered, and aloof. I thought it took Jacob out of character because as a young man he was very mild mannered and pleasant. I don't think that part made the story better."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a beautifully written novel. I gave it to my dad two Christmases ago, and meant to borrow it for myself, but kept forgetting. I finally put it on hold (still in high demand) at my local library and had my chance at reading.The story wraps you up and brings you to it's world. It has been a little while since I read it, and I don't like giving out specifics, but I cannot find fault with this book.I highly recommend it b/c it will remain on your mind for weeks after reading it and you'll be glad you got to know the characters and their stories."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A very good read!  The story as related by Jacob, alternated between the present when he's already 90 or 93 and during the 1930s when he was 23 and traveling with the circus.  It talked about loss, love, friendship (odd and otherwise), fellowship, family.  The book is full of so much emotion that even if I have not been to a circus all my life, and given that I am a woman, I was able to transport myself into Jacob's mind, and feel the story.  I just wish there was more to read after the old Jacob got himself into the circus \"train\" again."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Jacob Jankowski is a student at Cornell Veterinarian School.  He gets the heart-breaking news that his parents have died in a car crash.  In the throes of the great depression, Jacob finds out there is nothing left of their estate.  He tries to finish his exams but cannot.  Jacob takes the next train out of town.  Inadvertently, he finds himself on the Benzini Brothers Circus train.  Jacob is hired on and becomes immersed in the circus life.  He also falls in love with Marlena, one of the star performers married to August, the equestrian trainer.  Jacob is telling his story some 70 years later as a 93 year old patient in a nursing home.  Present day happenings are interspersed with his memories of life back in '31.  The circus chapters start with historical photographs lending to the authenticity of events.  Mesmerizing writing, fascinating characters, and actual documented circus events combine to make this an exceptional novel to enjoy!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is told through the \"90 something\" year old man in a retirement as he relives his life which came back to him when the circus comes to town.  The main character goes through some tough times and finds himself working for the circus a world he knows nothing about.  He then falls for a girl who is about as off limits as she can be.  This book is a very entertaining book that may start off a bit slow but once it picks up you can't stop reading until it's all over.  Fantastic book for a summer read!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for elephants is happy, sad, romantic, and exciting ,it changes from page to page. Just as something exciting happens it switches to Jacob struggling as an old man in a nursing home. There are plenty of plot twists and surprises. The book is a very detailed description of a disgusting circus in the 1930's from the illegal moonshine to straining horse trough water through a pair of clowns panty hose to make lemonade, and the red lighting (when they are thrown off of the train over a tressle) of unwanted employees.  Although the main character has some difficulty, you know it will be ok in the end because he tells it as an old man in a nursing home. During his time in the circus Jacob makes some very interesting friends, like Walter the midget clown, Earl the gentle security guard ,and Uncle Al who is way more of a jerk than he seems. Overall the book was a very exciting story about Jacob trying to survive in a circus and getting the woman he loves."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was so taken by this story when I first started reading it that I told my Mom about it, suggesting that she would love it. I was almost finished with the book when my Mom passed away. When going through her things, I found a copy of \"Water for Elephants\", and it really hit me hard emotionally, much like Jacob's feelings when his parents died (my Mom died from a neural hematoma after slipping on a step ladder). Now, almost five years later, I was able to bring myself to finish reading this wonderful tale, and I am so glad I did."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "WATER for ELEPHANTS was a quick and mostly enjoyable read for me.  The story of Jacob, a young man on the verge of his career as a veterinarian, was told as the flashback of a much older Jacob, who now resides in a nursing home.  As young Jacob was about to take his final exams and graduate from vet school, his world crumbled when his parents were killed in a car accident.  Left without family or money, a despondent Jacob jumped on a passing train.  He soon found himself working as a vet for a traveling circus.  The story of young Jacob's adventures with the circus is interwoven with the story of old Jacob's life as a resident in a nursing home.  I loved the book, but I found parts of it too graphic.  There were sexually explicit passages as well as descriptions of violent animal abuse, which I felt were overdone and unnecessary to the story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "At first I was hesitant about reading this book. I figured that reading about a traveling circus really wouldn't appeal to me, and I didn't understand why it was continually being suggested to me on this website. Eventually, I gave in and bought it. I pushed it aside for months, never bothering to read it, still mostly uninterested. Finally, bored one day, I picked it up and started reading. Two pages in, I didn't want to put it down.The opening is clever, leading to a fantastic ending. The writing style is charming, falling in love with the main character is completely inevitable.This is definitely on my top-ten list of novels. It is so beautifully written, I highly recommend it to anyone. It has all the mystery, love, emotion, and intrigue a novel should.I only hope the rest of her books are as lovely."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was a bit apprehensive about reading this book, but found it surprisingly refreshing in its approaches (spoken from two time periods) and its treatment of life as part of a circus \"family.\"  While the senior perspective was somewhat depressing, it was quite vivid of how one can be forgotten when one has so much life left to live and so much to share.  I also liked reading the excitement of the junior perspective, his trials and tribulations.  I think that both could have easily been expanded and still kept the reader's interest - wanted to know more about each character who are one and the same!  Bravo!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a sentimental story, with quite a bit of charm. It is touted as a \"crowd pleaser\" and that is probably the reason for its huge success. You do root for the narrator, even if the plot is contrived, the ending obvious, and the characterization somewhat weak.I would have hoped for a more authentic and earthy description of a Depression-era circus, but the writing is watered down. Often the conflicts between the characters are too quickly or conveniently resolved, and the characters seem to be at the mercy of the plot. Major crises are quickly skimmed over, and the true potential of this book is never fully developed.I read this to the end--which says something--but reflecting back on the book I wish it had been stronger and more carefully constructed. 3.5 stars."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It has an engaging premise, characters I came to care about and it is well written.Because the setting for the story is obviously a circus Ms. Gruen gives us a great deal of information about this business. Thankfully this adds to the story and doesn't bog it down. This story showed me that the circus is as much a lifestyle as it is a business.I would recommend this book to anyone and will probably read it again - and these are the highest compliments I can give to a book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a lovely story this was! I feel like it was witten for hollywood, I cant wait to see the movie. I loved the fact that the story was remembered by an old man. The author REALLY got what it feels like to be old and she makes you get it also. I felt like I was right in the story, I read through this wonderful book in a few days. My only complaint is that it wasnt a little bit longer. This is only about 300 pages but I felt it should have been more."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is the type of novel I expect to be on the bestseller list and is why I typically overlook popular novels, sometimes to my own detriment. An elderly man, now in a nursing home, looks back on his time spent as a veterinarian in a circus. It's a story that could have been capable of more, but the plot seemed fairly predictable and the characters not that believable or rounded. It wasn't bad, mind you, I guess you could say this elephant was just too watered down."}

{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is one of my all-time favorite books! The story is told by an old man looking back on his life in the circus during the Great Depression. As a young man he joins the circus after his parents died in a car accident. There he discovers a whole new and strange world in the small traveling community. He learns the hard work involved in the back scenes of a circus, as well as the harsh and sometimes tragic lives of the workers. It isn't long before he falls in love with the beautiful Marlena, one of the star performers. Things are complicated though. She's already married to the controlling and cruel head animal trainer.Get ready to cheer for the hero, boo the villain and ooh and ahhh at the story that draws you into a bygone time and place. It's a memorable book that will stay in your heart a long, long time."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book, as expected, is about the circus.  But it's about the circus in the early years....not the big stadium circuses we see today.The story is narrated by a 90-year old man in a nursing home.  He worked in the circus when he was younger, and when he sees a circus setting up down the street, he begins to reminisce.  The story is told in two eras, that of the man's young years with the circus (during the Depression) and that of the man's present time in the nursing home.I have to say that I looked forward to getting back to the book every day.  I truly enjoyed it.  It's action packed, thoughtful, and different.  I read this book very quickly!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this novel for my Nana long before it was made into a movie - she loved it and raved about it to everyone. I felt very proud to have picked a good book for her. A few years later I read it myself and I fell in love. This book is delicious and a real treat. You will fall in love with every character and you will not want the circus to end.Even if you have watched the movie - you should read the book - it is (as always) so much more than the movie."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book on a whim at a bookstore at an airport while waiting for my flight.  I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.  I am generally not a fiction reader, but this book was so \"real\" that I couldn't put it down.  The author tells the story from the viewpoint of a 90-something year old man from start to finish.  A young 20-something almost done with veterinary school's world comes crashing down when his parents are involved in a freak accident that causes their death.  Not knowing what to do with his life, Jacob signs on to work for a traveling circus.  Not only does this book paint an accurate picture of its protagonist, but it paints an accurate historic picture of life with animals, traveling with a circus, and the time period in which the book is set.I recommend this book to anyone.  It is an easy and quick read that will impress you start to finish."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was hooked from the beginning and looked forward to coming back to the story each time I had to turn off my Kindle.  Coming of age in a circus might seem cliche yet the insiders view of the social dynamics that existed within a circus really put context around the whole \"running away to join the circus\" thing; although, in this case, it might be more apt to describe this as \"stumbling into the circus\".  Regardless, while I felt the end of the circus component of the story was somewhat predictable, it didn't spoil the story for me.  A truly remarkable story that I will enjoy again and again."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "So I read this book WELL before the movie came out. I was intrigued by a story that had a backdrop in a circus.But I was left really disappointed. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I just didn't connect with the story at all. It may have just been the timing was wrong for me to read this story, but I was not into it (and I find myself rarely disappointed with books). I think there wasn't enough magic in it for me. I didn't see the basis for the romance. Maybe I need to try to pick it up again, but I was left so disappointed that I really don't want to."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It is hard to find a book that can be described by these four words: Brutal, Moving, Honest and Surprising.  But Water for Elephants is just that novel.  It is not for the faint hearted, and the cruelty and squalor depicted rival some of the works of Dickens.  But also like Dickens there is a sheer honesty and redemption to be found, and as for the ending ... well I will not give anything away except to say that I did not see it coming.  An outstanding book by an outstanding writer."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Truth be told, I was not interested in reading Water for Elephants. The subject matter, a memoir of a 93 year old former circus veterinarian, was not interesting to me. But this book got such rave reviews on Amazon that I decided to pick it up. And am I glad I did! The book grabbed me from the first chapter. The author gives life to some very interesting characters and the reader gets a true behind the scenes look at the citizens who made up a circus during the depression. The narrator of the story is Jacob, who runs away to join the circus after his charmed life takes a tragic turn. He gets a real life education. So did I while reading this book. I shed a few tears too. I could not put it down, and didn't want it to end. I will highly recommend this book, and I'm so glad I read it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a fantastic read. I had seen the movie and I wanted to read the book as well. I am so glad I did. Though the movie followed it very well, the book gives you more in-depth information that leads you along, their thoughts and some of the behind the scene activity that the movie could not show.Sara Gruen is a marvelous writer and so descriptive with her writing. You could almost smell the sweat of the men, the hay, the booze. You could hear the music and feel the drums pounding as the animals entered the Big Top.The story was so well told that it made you feel what Jacob felt both as a young man and as a 93-year-old man.I highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen has created an engaging memoir narrated by the nonagenarian veteran and veterinarian of a depression-era circus.  Her research into the caste hierarchy and politics of train circuses reveals a world which, much like HBO's Deadwood, had its own laws of lawlessness and morality of immorality.  Into this world Jacob Jankowski is unwittingly dropped, and the recounting of his evolution from inheritor of his father's veternary practice to circus vet to aged resident of an assisted living facility is almost always convincingly told.  While Jacob may be the hero/narrator, it is most definitely Rosie the elephant who steals the show and wins your heart.  Like the rubes who paid their nickels and dimes to gawk at the freaks, I felt my $14.37 was well spent for a 332-page peek behind the big-top."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed this book from start to finish.I'm not sure what it was exactly but it very much reminded me of Life of Pi which I also enjoyed.Jacob appealed to me as a character and I became genuinely interested in the fates of both rosy and the circus people.I preferred the chapters relating to Jacob's memory over those where he was an old man but this doesn't take away from the overall quality of the book. Although it is a fiction story I like that it was grounded with research and a combination of true stories which made the book feel more real.After reading the book I also watched the movie but as many people always say when they make a book into a movie, it wassnt half as good."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed reading Water for Elephants with it's many mini stories throughout. The characters were believable - Jake as the 91 (or 93) year old and his remembering of his life as a 23 year old. Anyone who has been to the yesteryear circus will recognize the descriptions of the circus coming to town and the excitement of the residents. There are funny incidents and sad ones that make up this book and the usual good and bad characters we all encounter. I admired the 91 year old Jake for his spunk when he took charge of his life as I admired the 23 year old Jake when he did the right thing for the animals of the circus. A great story that is heartwarming too."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book! Honestly the only reason I picked it up was because of the movie with Robert Pattinson (yes, I know...I rarely justify the reading of a book with an actor).  I really enjoyed the time setting for this book and the behind the scenes look at the life of a circus worker back then.  I also liked how the entire book wasn't just a love story and how nicely it was framed within the overall novel.  This is definitely a book that I would recommend and read again! And just as a side note, the move was awesome as well!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you like adventure, romance, suspense, and excitement... read the last third of Water for Elephants. The first two-thirds set the stage for a thrilling ending, but that's all. Although Gruen's style of writing is rich with varied vocabulary and description, the elements of the first part of the plot evoke little to no emotion in the reader. Even if the author didn't spend a hundred pages building the back-story, the strange sexual elements that rear their ugly faces every few pages completely ruin the enjoyment of reading this book. If you want to spend 300 pages wondering why you're reading this story, then pick up Water for Elephants and enjoy the most boring story you have ever read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I took this book with me on a recent trip to South Africa and was delighted to have something to read that was so engaging that the time passed quickly. The story grabbed me from page one. It's an unusual story, beautifully written and with well-drawn characters. Although going back and forth between the past and present day was a little disorienting, I enjoyed getting to know Jacob as a 20-something and as a 90 (or 93) year old man.I really liked the device of using the prologue later in the story. And I loved the ending - it was perfect for the story, even though it's implausible and unbelievable. Sometimes that just doesn't matter. Sometimes it works anyway. Everything about this book worked for me."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is an amazing book.  The author took my mind into places I just did not want to go, into what it means to be a person at the end of life, still coherent but old and sick and living in a nursing home.At the end of your life, is that all that's left to hope for, that you end up in a nursing home with kids younger than your grandchildren bossing you around and moving you back to your room against your wishes after an argument with another nursing home resident?  Is this what the end of life means, an adult becomes a dependent child who must be bossed around by others, even if that person's mind and intellect are still intact?  Wow.  Of course I know these things happen, but never in fiction have I seen the final years of a person's life etched to the pages in such an emotional and moving way."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants was recommended to me by a co-worker, and I was really surprised at how much I liked it. A book about a circus didn't necessarily appeal to me, but I figured it was worth a shot.This story is great. I really enjoyed the way the story alternated between Jacob in present day and Jacob's memories. In both times, he was heartwarming and sincere, even if he could be a bit cranky in his older age. :)The characters were great--well-developed and dimensional, even the ones you didn't particularly like. The whole circus feels very vivid, and I just loved Rosie to death.Overall, it was just a very enjoyable read with enjoyable characters (well, mostly, unless they weren't supposed to be). One thing that I found unexpectedly interesting was the circus dynamic--the cruelty, the hierarchy, the crazy characters. All in all, this is a very well-rounded novel and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "\"Carried water for elephants indeed. Do you have any idea how much water an elephant drinks?\" These words of Jacob Jankowski open this well-researched, fascinating novel about circus life. This story is told by ninety-something Jacob as he vacillates between the present and the past, reflecting upon an incredible life that was not always easy, but was satisfying.Jacob finds himself in a nursing home, his mind still active and questioning the meaning of his existence. Reminiscing about his life, he searches for meaning in the bland nursing home food and the fellow nursing home occupants, most of whom have surrendered their logical minds. As he remembers his life following the death of his parents when he was in his early twenties, he marvels at how every event led to the life he had.Well-researched and accurate, many incredible facts of circus life are divulged in this story. To add to this realism, there are actual photographs from circus archives. This is one unforgettable book!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Riding Lessons: A Novel,Flying Changes: A NovelSara Gruen's gift for drawing her characters as complex, whole, fully real persons is what makes Water for Elephants and her other books achingly wonderful to read. She so skillfully sets up the reader for the crest of each wave of the plot, that one is rooting for a positive change, a win for the character, while at the same time feeling the reverberation of their flaws and weaknesses.The book reads very much like a memoir, making it is easy to forget that it is a work of fiction. And, in order to sketch such a complex setting, I know she had to spend a very great amount of time researching the complexities of a circus on the road. I immediately bought and read her two other novels and found them excellent reads while seeing how she has developed her skills with each book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a very interesting story within a story. A story reflecting back on the life of a man who is now in his 90's  in &#34;Assisted Living&#34;. We learn much about living a life in the Circus, especially back in the 30's....it was no picnic!! Along with tragedy we find adventure, humor and romance. I would have given the book 5 stars but for the swearing and sex content. I didn't expect that. It didn't have to be so explicit, so in my opinion the 4 star rates it a very good read!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a wonderful and delightful book! This is a look thru the eyes of a 93-year young man of his experiences with the circus mixed with today.  What an experience he had in years gone  by; what we do to our elders now because we are too busy with our own  daily lives. This has an absolutely magnificent ending...something quite unexpected and heartwarming. I hope there is a circus in town when I get to Jacob's age and my family is busy with their life. I think I would make a great ticket taker."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I finished this book only because I felt like I had to. I suppose it was well researched and written because I felt the same way about reading it that I feel going to a county fair or local carnival: a little grimy, a little ashamed, a little grossed out. It's not a glamorous life and it wasn't a good time, economically speaking. The writer definitely gets that across. The content was just a little disturbing to me. But for those who like a dark and somewhat gritty story, this is probably really enjoyable. Just not for me."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "We listened to this on a road trip out west and I loved it! The story itself was a great leave from my everyday, but the voices were fantastic! I loved hearing cantankerous 90 (or 93..) year old Jakob tell his tale. If you enjoyed reading this book, I'm sure you will love it more hearing the tale from the two Jakobs. If you haven't read the book, there is a good chance you will be drawn in by the storytellers and end up loving it. We sat in the car after we arrived home for the last 10 minutes of the book we were so enthralled.Get this and listen to it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book.  It was breath-taking alive - as if I could smell it, taste it and feel it.  It was like I became lost in the Great Depression era.  I so wanted it to end so that I could hear the conclusion of Jacob's life with the circus, but I didn't want it to end because it was such an enjoyable book.  I liked the way the story was narrated by Jacob as a young man and as an old man.  It is hard to believe that this was not an autobiography."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Being a born horse-lover, I have read Sara's previous books about horses.  I loved them.  When I heard she had written another book-I just had to read that too.  Her writing style is very readable.  You become immersed in the characters.  \"Water For Elephants\" is a book for all generations.  I had both my daughters read it.  We all fell in love with the main character, Jacob.  I can't say enough good things about this wonderful heartwarming book.  Highly recommend!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I didn't realize this was such a controversial book until I came to write my review. I liked the book. It is fast paced and an easy read. I did not like the explicit sexual scenes; I don't think they added anything, other than showing Jacob was nave, which we knew anyway. I didn&#8217;t like the animal abuse, and the fact that he was a vet and didn&#8217;t do anything about it, but if he would have he probably would have been red-lighted. The author did a lot of research about the circus in that era and it was interesting to read about some of the things that really did happen."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Gruen 'feels' what it must be like to retain a facile mind but be trapped in an aging body.  What do we have left?  Our memories--the 'pictures' we have made through life that are filed away in our memory banks.  Props to Gruen for her obvious deep research into the time period, especially what circus life was really like during the depression (and beyond).  Her characters are engaging and true to form, and she uses them to weave a wonderful tale.  A great read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was captivating from page 1.  The story kept a good pace and is one of those books you just don't want to put down.  I really connected with the main character and felt his emotions as if they were my own.  Other characters were both likable and despicable, but all the while intriguing.  A very interesting story and enlightening as well.  I can imagine life on a circus train during the depression and realize now that it was not all it was cracked up to be.  Highly recommend!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen is a truly gifted writer. Water for Elephants follows a young man (Jacob) during depression-era America after he loses his entire family to a car accident. Soon after dropping out of vet school following the deaths, Jacob jumps a train that turns out to be a circus. The story is his coming of age story, with romance, violence, hilarious adventures and mystery. All set against the canvas of the larger than life traveling 'menagerie.'The story is told by Jacob as a 90+ year-old reminiscing about his days in the circus when one comes to town across the street from his retirement home - dredging up long-forgotten memories. I absolutely LOVE the ending where Jacob 'escapes' his retirement home on yet another adventure! Cheers to Gruen - I will look for more of her books. This one was superb!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I did NOT expect this graphic brutality when I bought this book; circus animals killed because of lack of food or just laziness on the part of the handlers. The story starts off in an engaging way, Jake the old man in the nursing home was entertaining. But there were too many instances of animals being abused/killed that I could not finish this book as it seemed to become the main focus. Too many animals in life are mistreated as it is and I do not need this information shoved in my face via a novel. This book should come with a warning to potential readers right on the front cover."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have seen Water for Elephants  at all the popular bookstores for the last year.  It never appealed to me, so I always passed over it.  This month, it was choosen as my book club's choice and I was pleasently suprised.  It was a true page turner and I finished the book in one weekend.  Gruen captured the time period and the secret world of circus people during the Depression beautifully.  It made me want more and to know more about the people of that era who worked on the circus trains.You won't be disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a book that grabs you from the beginning. It's a fantastic story that keeps you interested the whole way through. And it's a quick read. I just loved it so much. It's something for everyone, from the historical interest in the life of the traveling circus people during the depression, to the descriptions of old age in a nursing home. I actually insisted my husband read it when I was done. He's not an easy man to please, but had to admit how much he enjoyed it as well. I purposely don't want to say too much about the story since I enjoy reading books \"fresh\" without too much advance information. The only negative I would say is that the ending was bit unbelievable to me. But by that time everything else was so great, I didn't really care. It was as though the author was all done and didn't know how to end it. But I can forgive that."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is certainly an entertaining piece of work, one that will keep you occupied for the 4-6 hours that it takes you to read it.  Definitely not heavy lifting, but amusing and well worth the time.The story revolves around Jacob Jankowski, a 93 year old nursing home resident who \"flashes back\" to his early adult years spent in the Benzini Brothers circus.  The circus backdrop provides the opportunity to introduce numerous colorful characters and anecdotes (many of which are historical) that keep the story moving along at a good pace.The book opens with a prologue which is revisited near the end of the novel with an extremely well devised plot twist and puzzler.  I thought this was extremely well done.  The end of the novel, involving the 93 year old Jacob, was also very satisfying.All in all, a light, entertaining and easily consumed piece of work."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "WOW. It's been a long time since I read a book this good--I was so sad when it ended!  I kept wishing I could share more of Jacob's amazing life--and the ending, what a boffo finish.  I would have NEVER guessed that one! This is much beyond a good \"summer read\"--how is it this book did not hit #1??  I love historical fiction, and I am usually very 'into' the time period and the 'feel' of the era...this one was particularly evocative; you could swear you smelled the animal cars, the greasy scent of the carnie food, the whiff of the stale sleeping quarters.  I could almost feel sweet Rosie's pain at the hands of the cruel August; and when he met his fate, I cheered Rosie like she was a hero (she's an ELEPHANT).  What a rich read--if you begin it, make sure you don't need to sleep that night!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Jacob looks back to memories of love and his time with the circus when he was a young man.  He needs them now more than ever to get him through the declining life he lives out in a nursing home. The story portrayed a difficult, sad, evil circus environment where animals were mistreated by men who mistreated each other as well, I guess to survive the depression.  I wanted more from the story than its hopeful ending.  I wanted throughout to be lifted above its base struggles. I want more vivid descriptions of scenes and increased depth to the characters. What Jacob, like so many in nursing homes needed most was the comfort of family, friends, and staff to listen, to care. A well written book with depressing undertones."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I must confess I had to listen to the audio version of this because I'm not allowed to open my Kindle until Christmas.  Either way, this was the best book I've \"read\" in a very long time.  I think I could understand Jacobs feelings about being in the nursing home since I had to deal with my mom being in a nursing home.  His description about sitting in the dining room was so real.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy it.  Also, it has a great ending."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I haven't seen the movie (I usually prefer the books anyway), so had little knowledge of the plot. I really enjoyed the history of how the country was during the Depression and how, basically, lawless the country still was, where people could come and go and even disappear. I enjoyed learning the levels of \"society\" within the circus and the behind the scenes look at the life of performers and workers. Life was hard in those days with no government assistance to fall back on. Aside from the window into a different time and place, the plot was interesting too."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Just finished this wonderfully colorful novel & I was not disappointed.....Once I started reading,I could NOT put it down...Loved the circus setting,strong characters and animals...Now I cannot wait to see the movie...One of the best stories I have read all year....And the author very realistically portrays what it actually means to get older...I'm not as old as the elder Jacob yet but each year that goes by,I can tell the difference in the physical abilities....If you are looking for entertainment,this book will provide it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Shame on you if you ever look at an old person again and don't remember they were once young and had the world by the tail.Jacob is now ninety or ninety-three, he can't remember, and is living out his last years in a nursing home treated as belligerent and cantankerous.He sits a lot and while he sits, recalls his life in the circus.  It is an amazing and fantastic story. And so I don't write a spoiler I will simply say, I couldn't put the book down!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've seen the book from time to time, but the cover never intrigued me enough to actually buy and read it. Now I wish I had picked it up the first time I saw it! It is a delightfully different story of a 93 year old man who tells his story of his years in the circus through flashbacks. The topics are obviously well researched and that adds something special to the novel. It is a very engaging read and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a lighter, different type of book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had heard mixed reviews about both the book and the movie and was a little wary of both, but when prime gave a free month subscription I figured it was worth at least trying the book.  I loved it!  I found it to be very witty - I absolutely fell in love with the 93 year old Jacob, and the historial aspect was very interesting... I never knew the history of the circus before reading this or what a great competivie market it was back in its hayday!  I will never look at the workers of a traveling show the same way again. I thought the book was a little slow paced for my taste but well worth it.  I even went ahead and watched the movie and found the book to be far more superior in context.  Great read!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is a gripping story filled with both the sadness and the joy of life. Hope and regret thread through the pages gripping the reader in a heartrending but mesmerizing journey. Filled with characters struggling to choose right over wrong as well as those who are selfish and greedy, the reader will alternately lament their choices, feel their pain, sympathize with their struggles, and cheer their successes. Animal lovers beware there are some fairly graphic depictions of the way circus animals have been treated over the years. Gruen's unapologetic descriptions of circus life for all involved, the workers, the performers, and the animals strips away the romanticized idea that running away with the circus could ever be the answers to one's troubles in life. All the while, Water for Elephants also grounds us in the reality of aging and reminds us that perhaps we should listen a little and \"do\" a little less. Gruen's writing immerses the reader in a world so real the reader feels compelled to remind one's self it's fiction."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "i totally don't understand why so many people loved this book. i earnestly tried to read it the whole way through but couldn't. the main character is completely unbelievable, and the dialogue is terrible (i find it hard to believe people spoke that way in the year this novel took place). the prose in this book had zero imagination. when i read books like this, i feel like the author is more interested in finishing than developing the work.the litany of things i hated about this book would take all day to write. i suppose if you were ever interested in read this tripe, go for it, as it seems like tons of people loved it. i hated Water for Elephants, however."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love when you open a book and start reading, and you visualize yourself right there.  Not only do you see things, you can smell the aromas in the air, and you are stopped just short of touching.  You stand there witnessing the events going on around you.  You can not stop them, you can not change them, but you are feeling the feelings of everyone there.  I did not want this book to end.  This book had me emotional from the beginning to the end, and even beyond."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was hesitant to read this book since it felt like everyone I knew who raved about it was a middle-aged lady and I didn't think it'd have enough action to keep my attention.  To my pleasant surprise, the writing was just brash enough to make me want to keep reading, often laughing out loud at the bizarre pseudo-autobiography.  I recommend it as a quick, easy, summer read.  Yes, a bit on the chick-lit side of the spectrum, but very good just the same."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I simply don't understand the fanfare.  Every bit of this story was heartbreaking.  The animal abuse (especially Rosie), the human abuse (Walter and Camel, especially), and all of the heartbreaking things that happened at the hands of certain men.  What was there to enjoy about this story?  Revenge at the end?  Ok, so I liked the last 3 pages.  But those last 3 pages didn't make up for my sadness throughout the whole of this book.  I wish I hadn't read it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A 90+ gentleman (sharp as a tack) in a nursing home watches from the window as a circus comes to town.  He takes us back in time to his own \"carny\" days as a veternarian for the circus animals.  So far sounds boring as heck, doesn't it?  Well, this is one old gent you come to really like.  We learn a lot about the shenanigans behind the scenes of the circus as well as the plight of those during the depression.  Again, sounds boring.  But this author makes it a story you can't put down.  This is a testament to a great writer.  I believe she could make the phone book interesting.  JUST READ IT !!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Fortunately, I didn't pay full price for this book; I borrowed it on my Kindle through my Prime membership.The author found some interesting true circus stories but wove them together poorly. The book read like a treatment for a screenplay, in that it seemed less like a novel than an attempt to sell a script to Hollywood. The characters all sounded the same, and the dialogue was too modern for the time period of the novel. I have not seen the movie, but I think it would at least be visually interesting to distract from the plot. The love story is barely believable and the villains are archetypes--you've seen them before.Not very deep, but the animals are interesting. Much more so than the people."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A friend loaned me this book and told me it was one of the best she'd ever read.  Then she said, in a voice just above a whisper, \"It's about the circus.\".  To be honest, that didn't intrigue me at all.  But right from the start I was hooked and finished the book in two days, then re-read it a couple of days later to my husband.  This is a book I will read over and over again just because of the beauty of the characters and the fascinating facts about the depression-era circus."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I listened to the unabridged audio CD version as I drove the last couple of weeks. I know that the book was (and is) a wildly popular bestseller, but I have to confess that the thought that kept nagging at me as I listened was why? I'm not saying this is a bad book. It is somewhat engaging. However, I didn't find any of the characters particularly vivid or humanly multi-dimensional. And as soon as Rosie the elephant was added to the circus, halfway through the book, I had a (correct) feeling as to where the plot line was moving, so no surprise ending. I have no idea whether circus life in the prohibition era was anything like this, so can't comment on the authenticity of the backdrop, but I found it pretty depressing. Altogether, a pretty so-so read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The writing in this book is about boring and uncreative as it can get. I am not speaking about the story, which is OK, though nothing too special. But the writing style itself and the use of the English language by the author is about as dry and unimaginative as one can get.It's a fast read, and I kept waiting for the plot twist that would make the book a worthwhile read, but was left disappointed. Not a great read, but not horrible either, just very middle of the road and very forgettable. The author used to be a technical writer prior to writing this book and it shows."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was given this book by a friend that insisted that I read it, \"It was fabulous\".  I read about 100 pages of it and set it down which is something I rarely ever do.  A couple months go by and I was at a party where a couple people again said what a great book it was.  I decided I had to give it another try so I picked it back up and continued to read it.  At the end, I still don't understand the love of this book.  I didn't care for the animal brutality and I just never connected with the characters in this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wasn't too enthusiastic about reading this, and so I chose to see the movie before deciding whether or not I wanted to purchase it. After seeing the film, I figured if the book is anything like the movie it wouldn't be half bad. The book is A MILLION times better. I read it in a few days and was absolutely hooked from cover to cover. As the book progresses, you find yourself feeling everything Jacob feels: guilt, love, affection, worry etc. Gruen did an awesome job bringing the story to life and the characters Rosie and Kinko were definitely an added bonus. I would recommend this to just about anyone old enough to handle a few \"detailed\" scenes and my book had a series of pictures every couple of chapters, some of which I would deem inappropriate for younger kids. I'm seventeen and didn't have an issue with them, but parents BE WARNED."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I give this book a 2.6.  All those people Jacob's father helped in that little town and no one came forward in his time of tragedy?  It just didn't seem realistic to me.  Someone from immigrant stock with the pluck and drive to get into Cornell vet school is not likely to founder in this situation, nor just dismissively to walk away from his final exams.  Jacob wasn't a pampered trust fund baby; he'd probaby had it a bit rough all along. The rest of the story is just a contrivance built upon an unbelievable premise."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book. While it has history it is not a dull history book and the history is indeed interesting. The book details the lives of different people enveloped in the gold rush from a wonderful clergy man ,a young Irish woman with a keen sense for business, successful and not so successful miners plus those who went there with no knowledge of mining or life in the very rugged north.The book is very well written and weaves the history, the town of Dawson, and the individual characters together seamlessly."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "To me Hemingway epitomizes the hard drinking, hard living, hard loving, worldy writer. In this book, the main character Robert Jordan is a soldier send on a mission to the hills of Spain to blow up a bridge. There, Jordan meets up with a rogue band of warriors who believe in war but not in military. Once united with the militia, Jordan becomes involved with a woman named Maria. The fight scenes are incredible. The ending is even more incredible. I'm not going give away the book, but the ending  brought tears to my eyes- I guess it's true, underneath every man of steel is a heart of gold."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "An interesting historical novel set in the context of Revolutionary Spain, but classic Hemmingway, it carries with it the important lesson of activism over apathy, especially pertinent to today's world.  It teaches that ideals transcend political boundaries and that if you believe in something strongly, then you owe it to yourself to protect that ideal in any part of the world and at any cost, even that of your life.  Intwined is a beautiful love story.  One of my top 5 greatest books of all time.  Thats a rave, baby.  The poem by John Donne at the beginning makes the book worth buying.A 5 because it is a great story with an invaluable lesson.  If you gain nothing, you still read beautiful prose by one of the greatest authors ever."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For Whom the Bell Tolls takes the reader on a three and a half day journey starring Robert Jordan who is assigned with blowing up a bridge. He is in Spain and the fighting is between fascists and the Republicans (Robert Jordan&#8217;s side). It accounts his time with a group of guerrilla fighters.While the writing drags on at times and in the beginning it is difficult to tell what or whom the dialogue is between, it is a pretty good book. Topics such as love &#8211; between Maria and Jordan, the psychology of soldiers, and who God is are covered in this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is by far my favorite book ever.  I am sure many other people will lay out the plot for you in their reviews, so I will tell you what I loved about it.  I love the bravery and leadership of the main character Robert  Jordan, I loved how Hemingway used people such as the strong willed Pilar  and other characters to only make it seem more realistic, and I mostly love  how Hemingway painted a picture with Robert Jordan that is the example for  all people who want to see what bravery is.  No author could top this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I do enjoy the book. My issue is not with the book but with the people who altered it to suit their sensibility. If you don't like the langauge used in the book that is fine, but don't change every curse word to \"unprintable\", \"unmentionable\" because you and want you and your children to live in a bubble. You are ruining something that is perfect as it is. You lack the creative ability to create anything on your own so you believe changing curse words into clever terms makes you an artist. Whoever edited this book need be shot, and be sent back to whatever community college academic standpoint they came from where they believe the world is fair and things should all be politically correct.NEVER CHANGE THINGS TO SUIT YOUR SENSIBILITY!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For Whom the Bell Tolls is perhaps one of the greatest books of the 20th Century. Set in revolutionary Spain about 1933 or so, the book covers less than a week of real time, as American Republican Partisan Robert Jordan assists a band of guerrillas in blowing up a bridge in preparation for a major Republican attack.  Hemingway is a master storyteller, and the weaving of love, life, death, and the horrors and deceit of war are well developed.  You know the ending at the beginning, and yet the development of the story and characters are so rich and so complete that there is little to do but wistfully tear up during the last chapter.  The book is a page turner, and a must read treasure of 20th Century literature."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Hemingway used his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War to build the structure for this novel.  His descriptions of the settings are superb. The novel is a great introduction to the Spanish Civil  War, a war with which many Americans are unfamiliar. Hemingway used  characters like Pablo to show how people lose their humanity during war.  The story is powerful.  His main character, Robert Jordan, begins to  question whether anything good will come of all the fighting.Despite its  many wonderful attributes, this novel has some problems.  The dialogue is  stilted.  The romance (as in all Hemingway novels) is unbelievable.  Finally, Hemingway should have stuck to English.  His use of Spanish in  this book is embarassing.Nonetheless, in my opinion, For Whom the Bell  Tolls should be required reading for all U.S. high school students.  It's  truly a classic."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read many, many books. I read many good books. But I read few books that are masterpieces and that I *know* are masterpieces before I've even finished them. This is one of them.Hemingway is a writer of many virtues and his share of faults. All his virtues and few of his faults are on display here. He brings to life a little skirmish in a &#34;little&#34; war that would perhaps be largely forgotten by most of the world were it not for this very book. His characterizations (with the exception of Maria, who however well she serves her purpose, is still, frankly insipid) are brilliant. Jordan is easily one of his most likable and relatable heroes, Pilar one of his best female characters. The conflict, and especially the climax in the last fifty pages, is electric.Thought-provoking, moving, entertaining - what more can you ask from a book?"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For Whom the Bell Tolls is a Hemingway less affected by his modernist tendencies than To Have and Have Not yet not as uninfluenced as The Old Man and the Sea. Also, there is a good deal of sexual discussion and activity, though all of it is done in an explicit-yet-entirely-implied manner exclusive to Hemingway's style. This story of the American professor who joins the Spanish Communists in their fight against the fascists explores love, morality, Communism, duty, awareness of death, and bravery in the face of death. Specifically, impending doom expedites and deepens the life and love of the characters.  A good first read but not necessarily worth a return."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This novel brings one into close contact with the forces in dreadful conflict during civil war--Solidarity versus Brutality; Hemingway portrays both thoroughly. The story told by Pilar in this book seemed to haunt me  for a few days, the images were so clear, and as one will find by reading  it, it is a story which has a very grave lucidity, as if you wished  Hemingway would drown the scene in a sea of lifeless and complex words.  The descriptions of the love story and Jordan's internal motivations  immediately soothe the unsettling images of war, and the novel as a whole  works paradoxically to the point where both sets of images collide, and  leave the reader both unsettled and fulfilled simultaneously."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "After having read the first half of this book, I was bored.  Nothing happened.  We heard about a future attack, but it never happened.  But then suddenly, at the last few chapters, it finally took place.  And then the book got so exciting that I sat there gasping for air.  I also understood why the boring first half was included, because that part was the one that made the last half in to such an incredible experience.  And after I read the whole book, the first half became exciting too. So buy this book, it is the best I have ever read.  But keep in mind, that the first half is boring.  So do not give up.  Keep reading it to the end, and I promise you the best reading experience you have ever had. It is the first book by Hemmingway I have read, but it will not be the last."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you're a Hemingway fan, then you should not miss this book. There's a reason why many people feel this is his best novel. The scenery, character development, plot and overall picture in words make this a masterpiece. With the Spanish civil war as his launching point he makes great strides in making the reader feel the grip of ANY war past or present. What you get here is a lot of his philosophy on war, life, love and death. A theme with which he was more than passively familiar having had several near-death experiences until he finally took his own life. Compared to many of his other works, the ending is also somewhat of a fresh surprise. The John Donne quote cited in the fly leaf speaks volumes about the current troubles in the world today. Like all great literature, despite being written more than sixty years ago, this book still feels fresh and new."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I tried to get through it, I really did.  But then I remembered what a chore it was in High School when two of his novels were required reading.  It bored me stiff then, and it does now.  But I have found that with Hemingway, he's either your cup of tea, or he isn't.  The characters are shallow, and I don't like his writing style, in any of his stories.  Personal choice, to each his own.  As the reviews show, some love it, some don't.  I don't.  But at least I won't resort to name calling like some reviewers do, when someone doesn't share their opinion.  If you've never read it, give it a try, you may love it.  If you don't, its not indicative of your intelligence level as some would have us believe."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For Whom the Bell Tolls, is equally very engaging and very dull.  Occasionally this novel cracks with energy, the tension among the characters is quite potent, and then at other times it bores you near sleep.  The rambling monolgues can be great(like when Pilar is detailing Pablo's once fervent commitment to the cause) and then at other times the words seem to be an annoying roadblock that you have to wade through to get to the meaty parts.  All in all I respect this novel and do think it is a good work, but I can't give it more than 3 stars, because of the chores it sometimes put me through."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a great book if you are interested in the history of the Spanish Civil War. It is also useful if you are seeking insights into Hemingway. So much of the novel is taken directly from the author's experiences as a foreign correspondent in Spain for the North American Newspaper Alliance.There are many facets of the book which contribute to its outstanding reputation. Hemingway's treatment of Robert Jordan, the protagonist, is exceptional. Jordan is a very complicated man who is radically transformed by the events described in the book. He is also the first Hemingway hero to contemplate suicide.El Sordo is a leader of another guerilla band which is operating in the same territory as the band in which Jordan serves as an aide. The description of El Sordo's last stand on a hill against the Nationalists is an example of Hemingway's best writing."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Geez, who am I as a novice author to make a comment or review on Hemingway.I read this book to gain an insight into dialogue. What an insight that was.  It runs from start to finish.I had an advantage of having seen the film, albeit a long time ago but, that made the book even more interesing to me personally as I could not only read the dialogue but visualise the characters better and hear them in my mind.It taught me a great deal and I hope some of it will rub off into my own future scribbles.I will now be reading other works of his"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've probably read this book over 4 or 5 times throughout the years, first having read it as part of an assignment in a High School English class.  This is my absolute favorite book, and I'll tell you why.  As many reviewers have already pointed out, this book is enjoyable on so many levels: the characters are deep and complex; the questions about their purpose are deep.As a native Spanish speaker, I truly enjoy this book much more because Hemingway's prose is an exact translation of how the characters would speak in their Spanish setting, which I only realize now living in Puerto Rico and re-reading this masterpiece after many years (and two war tours).  The conversations, which may seem awkward to a non-Spanish speaker, are perfectly natural if translated into Spanish, adding to the realism of his tale.  Chalk this up to Hemingway's genius and his ability to create realistic worlds in which his characters live and die."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I revisited this book in my early 40's and came away resold on Hemingway as one of America's greatest writers and an artist who stands the test of time. It's a shame, in fact, that Hemingway's caricature-friendly persona, life and writing style have sometimes obsured his work. Forget the macho image and the stories of drinking and hunting. He is an artist of the first order.For Whom... is a novel about the important things -- life, love, death, fear, the attraction and horror of war. What struck me throughout was how innocent the characters are and how genuinely Hemingway depicts the most difficult subjects, be it war (in this case the Spanish Civil War) or the love between Maria and Robert Jordan.Hemingway is a writer we need in our times. He focuses on the big, important issues without cynicism, and never shies from exposing what is in our hearts and minds. A classic."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I did not care much for the story.  It was before my time so I have no connection to the events. The big looser for me was the writing style. It was probably a well accepted style at the time but just does not fit in today. Hemingway changed his style several times in his life and this is just an example of a style that went astray.I enjoyed &#34;The old man and the sea&#34; which was written quite differenty. The fact that there was only one person involved made a difference."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story is a classic. It details events that occurred during the Spanish civil war of the late 1930s when fascism was on the rise in Western Europe.In 1944, in my adolescent romanticism, I had become immutably bonded to the characters and Ingrid Bergman after seeing the movie that had just come out.Now, 70 years later and reading the details of the love affair, I was to discover that I understood practically nothing of the historical significance in which the story takes place. The atmosphere of the guerrilla cave and escapades left a deep impression on me that was never to be forgotten.Should you read this novel, I might suggest that seeing the movie first might place the characters most strongly in their rightful desperate and fateful surroundings as so skillfully described by the author."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Hemingway is one of the best known authors worldwide and with good reason. As someone with limited knowledge of European history and a complete ignorance of the events of the Spanish Civil War, this had me engrossed and wanting to learn more. It had me so engrossed that I nearly wanted to go join a rebel movement and dedicate myself to war a la Robert Jordan.This book has the vital ingredients of sex and war and mixed together with Hemingway's unbelievably creative writing style, makes for one of the best works of fiction of all time."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It's hard to write a a concise review for this wonderful novel that would begin to capture the emotion and vitality within its pages. Read the Amazon description for a plot summary; but don't be fooled into thinking it's a black and white story about the Spanish Revolution.  Hemingway has an amazing way of capturing the sheer humanity of the whole undertaking.  The Reds, the fascists, the anarchists and the uncommitted are all examined and ultimately shown as being human beings first, and political creatures second.At the same time it is the ultimate war novel and love story.  Hemingway delves into Jordan's perspective of the characters and is vivid in his description of the Spanish countryside while also maintaining a near stream of consciousness of intelligent thoughts.  The simultaneous vitality and fatalism of the characters is amazing.  Truly a wonderful book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Having recently come back from Paris, I went through a Hemingway phase, starting with his memoirs of his Paris days, then I stumbled on this book.The stumbling was a fortunate accident, for this book is amazing.  Hemingway's short but powerful prose is in perfect form. I actually find  Hemingway and Gabriel Garcia Marquez similar in their ability to capture a  thought completely in one sentence- even though their actual sentences are  different.Hemingway perfectly captures poignant emotions, and the  sentence sparsity adds to the strength and description beautifully.I  also agree with one of the other reviewers above, in that my appreciation  is probably helped by age. A lot of the emotions of loss, doubt,  disillusion and love I only felt in my post high school years. It's a good  adventure story nonetheless, but might lose its power for a youger  audience."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Well, I'm embarrased to say that it took me until late in life to finally get around to reading this gem. And oh, what a gem it is. Robert Jordan is one of those characters that just stays with you. I found myself a bit envious of his adventure, at least for a while (don't want to give anything away). For me, having never fought in a war, the sense of romanticism, mingled with the clear tragedy, seemed a realistic picture of what it must be like.Ultimately, I admire the sense of duty and honor so many of these characters display, and I wonder how many people share that kind of personal commitment today. I like to think it's still a high number (certainly we see it our military men and women), but I can't help but wonder.......This book is a 5-star read all the way around. Read it. You won't be sorry."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "You understand you have to like Hemingway. This work embodied his distinct style of writing, the spare, yet eloquent manner that is known as his. Hemingway's ability to saddle every word with meaning and emotion is at it's ripest in this work, where he writes a war story that encompasses the entire spectrum of the human experience, form love to hate, spite to sacrifice. While the Spanish Civil War included tens of thousands, Hemingway writes of a handful of people who represent the whole of the country. Heroes do not always win in Hemingway's world, but in their defeat, they do win. The bravery and ultimate sacrifice of the protagonist captures that bitter fact of life. This novel has a meaning and lesson that can only be appreciated and understood by those who have read it. It would be a loss not to."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had to write this review because of the review someone else wrote...This person said it was about Hemingway's support for anti-communists and young americans going over to Spain during the civil war to fight the communists...He must not have read the book.  The main character of the book went to fight against the FASCISTS, not the communists.  He hated fascism and wanted to stop the fascist regime from taking Spain.  Fighting on his side were many communists, or Spanish backed by communist nations, such as the spanish generals trained by the communist Russian nation, so how on earth this reviewer could think it was against communism if he read the book is beyond me.  Also, this book is about much more, it explores moral issues and covers themes from love to the truth of war.  Hemingway really makes you see the tragedy and pointlessness of war."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "EXCERPTED FROM \"GOD'S COUNTRY\" BY STEVEN TRAVERS\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is based upon Hemingway?s support for the anti-Communists fighting in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s. He and many other Americans went over to fight in the war, which some say was a \"dress rehearsal\" for World War II. It did not materialize into the kind of idealized Spanish government that many had sacrificed for. The fascistic Francisco Franco ended up ruling an isolationist Spain until the 1970s. While the nation is now Democratic, the Franco regime was the final event that took Spain from greatness to mediocrity. Hemingway also wrote a stageplay about the Spanish Civil War called \"The Fifth Column\"."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Hemingway really did excellent work when he wrote this novel based on his experiences covering the war in Spain. I especially liked his description of his main characters female lover.  It gives a good idea of what the guerrillas did behind Fran cos lines. I really enjoyed the ugly women who had in her life many young handsome swashbuckling lovers who were matadors. This reminds me of advice I have given to women many times in my life essentially if you are a women and you like a guy pursue him it's really a buyers market for women when it comes to men in that respect."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Then check out the passage when he falls to nothing.  This is the best war book (along with Tim Obriens The Things They Carried which is way different, and about a different war, but equally powerful) that I have  read.  It exhibits everything and gets to the point of life and its lack of  purpose if you cannot find something worth dying for, and that that purpose  is not the real purpose at all when it comes down to dying.  This is not a  dark book, nor is it self-pitying as I imagine a less able writer would  make it so soon.  It is not even depressing, it is exciting and touching  and well-written.  And there's winesacks as well.  &quot;the bell tolls for  thou,&quot; he quotes.  This book gets to the connectedness and loneliness  of people."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you like Old Man and the Sea, you'll love this.  It is similar in feeling and has a Spanish flair.  I seldom remember lines from books, but I've memorized many from this novel.  The opening quote from John Donne is  as deep as they come.  It sets the tone for the book, but is better  understood if you immediately re-read the quote right after finishing the  book.  You really truly understand then what is meant when he says,  &quot;Do not send to know for whom the bell tolls....it tolls for  thee.&quot;"}

The walks are thoughtfully designed to comprehensively cover the city; Georgina Masson's writing is cultured, individual and excellent, and the book is chock full of interesting background detail to bring the city alive. Rome is a unique and fascinating place and she definitely gets it! Wore out one copy of this book (earlier edition purchased in '78) and am now working on the second, unfortunately much heavier edition, also not the current one.Not a book for the short-stay or casual visitor who just wants to hit the top sites, but if you want to do some in depth exploration, a tremendous resource (definitely a read ahead resource).  Buy this book while you can - its gone out of print a couple of times so far!"}

A good one to have in the hotel room and read at the end of the day (especially if you have someone to read some of the passages to, it is such good writing,) preparing for the next day's sight-seeing.  However, it is too heavy and detailed to carry around with you and refer to during the day, unless you and your partner are willing to share the toting, and one carries this book and the other carries everything else!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought  A Companion Guide to Rome by Masson based on 5-star recommendations from Amazon, and for me it was not a worthwhile purchase.  The authors (it has been revised several times) offer infinite detail and historical tid bits, but it actually offers little that wasn't already in the Green Guide, and it is too heavy and too much reading in my opinion to do on site, while walking around. It was a nice reference, but I should have looked for it in the library and just borrowed it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The pleasure that Ms. Goodall had placed and received in sharing her life with chimpanzees is conveyed effortlessly in this book and touches you quite easily. I started reading this book not being to sure about what I was doing, since to know about the habits of these primates is not exactly among my list of favorite topics. So I just started browsing and before I knew it, sixty or eighty pages had gone by as well as my possibilities of getting up early in the morning.The author will guide your through the complex social structures in which chimpanzees live to the very detailed and amazing details of their everyday life. For example that they would eat gladly a human baby if given the chance. But more important she makes you care for their lives not as a consequence of a higher scientific purpose, but simply because the more that we relate to nature the more we are embraced in its blessings."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I first came across this book when I was browsing a tiny library in the building basement a couple of doors down.  I was probably around 10-12 years old and unable to check out the book (don't remember why) so instead I sat down in the stacks and began paging through it.  I absolutely loved looking at all the wonderful photographs and reading the captions, etc.  I was so pulled in by Ms Goodall's writings, I found it such an interesting book and it stayed with me all these decades.  I even majored in Anthropology in college, that's how inspired I was by this amazing book.The day I came across In the Shadow of Man, Jane Goodall became my hero.  Nearly forty years later, I still feel drawn to her chimp stories.  I think it's time I buy it to have forever.  Happy 80th Birthday, Ms Goodall."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A really fine volume. Jane Goodall describes her study of chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream in Tanzania. She and her team has studied these animals over a long period of time. This covers the social behavior of the chimpanzees in the earlier years of the study.The story occurs at several levels. One, simply, is the interaction of individuals with their own personalities--Flo, David, Goliath, Faben, Merlin, Passion, and so on. Another level is the group/society. What is the structure of the society studies?The book covers the life cycle of chimpanzees in this environment-- from infant on. It explores relations with other species. It looks at the variety of behaviors that characterize chimpanzee society--reproduction, feeding, hierarchy, predation, and so on. The book also addresses the challenges facing chimpanzees as humans encroach further.In the end, a riveting book, well worth reading."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was the first book I ever borrowed from the library as a kid. I met Dr Goodall herself a few years ago. A gorgeous, wonderful woman. Humble. Quietly spoken. Impossible to ignore. My signed edition of this book is a treasure I'll take to my grave!Jane Goodall was once described as Conservation's Greatest Rock Star. She was so far ahead of her time, science is now only beginning to catch up. This is a beautifully written account of the beginnings of the longest continuous animal field study on earth. The discoveries Jane Goodall made at Gombe, in Tanzania, redefined not only science's understanding of Chimpanzees, but also redefined human beings. Because of Jane Goodall, we could no longer consider man to be the only \"tool maker\" living on earth.In the Shadow of Man has all the elements of a best-seller - politics, violence, sex, warfare, murder, devotion, tenderness, even love."}

In fact, if you wanted to recreate that world, this is the blueprint -- not the world of the rich and the powerful (Proust is the blueprint for that), but the world of the rustics, the rural/urban poor, the artisans.Jean Renoir's own memoirs of his life in cinema are also fine, but much more fragmented.

Another of Lorenza de Medici's big, unwieldy books of gorgeous pictures of Italian scenery paired with mediocre recipes.The text, not written by de Medici, has several silly errors, saying that sugar cane came from the New World and pumpkins from the Old, which is backwards.The recipes are better than in some of her other cookbooks, where we were treated to a gorgeous picture of, for example, croque monsieur, which isn't Italian and isn't really a recipe.But not much better. Vegetarians might go for many of them, since they are supposed to be from the peasant kitchens, where meat was, until recently, seldom seen. Yet the recipes are dull enough. Steamed asparagus topped with butter and lemon is, indeed, a fine dish, but not really a recipe.The food illustrations are punk, well under the gorgeous picture of croque monsieur, for example.The full page pictures of Italy are superb, though, if you like that sort of thing."}

William Dalrymple paints a picture full of humor and fascinating detail, mixed with love and frustration.  Which is what Delhi is: fascinating, frustrating, fun, and full of incredible people.  Delhi is multi-layered and not easily explained.  Delhi has to be experienced. Yet, Dalrymple brings to life a lot of the feeling of this magnificent city.  More importantly for me, he brings to life part of its history, details history books leave out, alley ways that deserve to be explored.  As a traveler blessed to return to Delhi fairly often, I have found the details of Dalrymple's book adding value to my visits - by knowing which alley ways might just be explored."}

In doing so, he succeeds in bringing out the secret lives of the eunuchs, passionate pigeon fights in Old Delhi, the wild rule of William Fraser in the jungles of Mehrauli, the frivolous codes of the decorum practiced in Mughal period, the popularity of the Sufi saints and their powers and much more to help you envisage the rich heritage of the city."}

Or if you wish to visit the sub-continent and Delhi, it will illuminate your understanding of this complex city.  Dalrymple tells the story of a city that has been ruled by Mughals, Sikhs, Hindus, the British and more recently regained its independence.  I read it swiftly.  Pleasant narrator/author, who added depth to the history, by plumping out past historical figures and including current day Delhi-wallahs in their daily life.  I would recommend this novel."}

There is an extensive chapter on seafood including some excellent recipes which shouldn't come as a surprise since Mexico boasts a 6000 mile coastline.

I am currently about a fourth of the way through War and Remembrance....it is equally splendid.  I first read Marjorie Morningstar and fell in love with Herman Wouk's style and mastery of the storyline and character development.  At times when reading these books I am incredibly sad, other times uplifted, and yet other times amazed.  Absolutely one of the best authors I've ever read...and I have read alot of books."}

I decided to get the Kindle edition and I am thrilled to read this wonderful author again.  I found the sequel 'War and Remembrance' in the last move and will read that.  This is a long novel but well worth the time.  Although fiction, it involved historical figures that give it a real-life experience quality.  The fictional characters are fully developed and it is easy to visualize their life during the run up to World War II.  It is definitely a cautionary tale in today's world where most of us have the tendency to bury our heads in sand--or in family and work--and hope things will get better without doing anything ourselves.  Great read.  I'm still on the second half (because this is really two volumes) and even knowing the end, I'm rooting for Natalie and Aaron to get back home."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I go from historical romance novels to historical fiction to non-fiction but easy-to-read history.  Each of them has its own slant on perspective about that era, ranging from history-as- wallpaper to up-close rendering, as if you were there.  This is one of the very few novels that manages to combine the elements of all 3 kinds of those books into a very gripping reading saga of WWII.  So you are given well researched history in a very palatable form. It follows an interrelated cast of characters all over the map with WWII, taking us deeply into the critical locales. There is even a fascinating account given by a German general, interspersed throughout, of the war as seen through the opposite side's eyes. Wouk does an incredible job and his sequel, &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; is almost as goood."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This novel was an enormous best seller in the 1970s for good reason.  Wouk is a skilled story teller, and the reader quickly learns to like and to care about the fate of Wouk's characters.  Also, Wouk portrays a vision of America appealing to Americans:  they enter war reluctantly, but once in, they fight the good war and fight it well.  Although Wouk knows too much about the military to abandon all cynicism, he portrays military men as generally competent, committed, and patriotic.The appeal of the novel is also its limitation.  This is not a meditation on the human condition like Tolstoy's \"War and Peace.\"  Also, Wouk uses his characters to tell the whole story of the lead up to World War II.  He is sufficiently skilled to pull it off, but he spreads his characters a bit thin in the process.I recommend the book as highly entertaining.  Despite its length, it reads fast."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Herman Wouk's tale is a huge masterpiece: sweeping in terms of plot, character, and history. His knowledge of WWII is staggering; years of research are evident in the story. He also has the rare gift of literary poetry, with imaginative similes rolling off the storyteller's pen. The one very slight fault is that the occasional letters or diaries lose a bit of their authentic voice; most people, even creative geniuses, don't pen such cleverly Shakespearian notes to their loved ones. Otherwise, this is a moving and satisfying drama about one of the globe's great tragic conflicts. NOTE: I read a hard copy, not the much-aligned Kindle version."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "\"The Winds of War\" and \"War and Remembrance\" must be read together. These lengthy novels follow the trials and travails of one American family through the years immediately preceeding the Second World War through to the end of that war. The author does a great job of depicting the terrors of the holocaust and of the ground war on Europe's eastern front. Likewise pacific naval combat is dealt with on a personal level. The historical context of the books seemed to be quite accurate. By the close of the second book the reader will have an appreciation for the cost of global war. Personally, I could have done with somewhat less of the romantic double-dealings and intrigue. My only other caution to the prospective reader is the daunting length of these books. I listened to the unabridged Audible Audio version of both books and found the narration to be excellent."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book, and it's companion, \"War and Remembrance\" are two of my favorite novels of WWII. I read/re-read them about every ten years. I find them exceptionally well written with clearly drawn characters who enter the traumic period of Western civilization's march through the use of the industrial model for the destruction of millions of people and an end to traditional European colonial powers. I find myself caring about the characters, their losses, and how they delt with a world bent on destruction; characters trying to balance traditional values while creating new beginnings from the ashes of a world focused on self-destruction and death. I have read most of Mr. Wouk's books and have been a fan of his writings for many years. You will not be disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "He's a most utterly unappealing protagonist.  Wouk wants us to think of Pug as a career-driven, very rigidly moral sort of person.  Instead, he came across to me as cold, humorless, stodgy, somewhat hypocritical, and very, VERY boring.  The few things Wouk has him do to make him less of a plaster saint (drinks a bit, smokes, lusts in his heart after a young English woman) didn't humanize Pug for me.  By the end of the novel, I found him about as likeable as Wouk's other famous character, Captain Queeg.That said, the plot of the novel was engrossing and most of the other characters (Including Hitler and Stalin!)were more interesting and entertaining than Pug.The definite highlight of the book is Wouk writing as the German General van Roon.  It's very convincingly done and it is in these sections of the book where what little (sly) humor Wouk offers is to be found."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For me,  THE WINDS OF WAR, combined with WAR AND REMEMBRANCE, comprise Herman Wouk's ultimate masterpiece. A sweeping telling of the World War II story from initial rumblings to Hiroshima, all through the eyes of a US Navy commander. The two books combined make for a massive read, but it's well worth it.  We must never ever forget the horror of the war, the horrific fate of the Jews caught in it's net and the brave men who willingly and, yes, gladly went off to fight enemies on both sides of the planet.  They are dying daily and the world owes them a huge debt.  Herman Wouk's accurate and fair telling of the story will stand as a monument to all of them. These books can be read and read again then listened to in the excellent audio version - they are that good."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a 5-star book that should read by anybody with an interest in WW II. The comments and complaints regarding sexism and poor female characters... well the book was published in 1971. Compare it to some of the other fiction being published at the time... Ian Fleming, John MacDonald, Robert Heinlein. Wouk comes of pretty well in comparison to those authors, I think, especially as his subject is war. Despite this, Wouk still constructs some fascinating female characters... and not all of them are brilliant, easy to sympathize with, or even very smart. But then again, neither are the men.It's a long story, a bit melodramatic at times, will infuriate you, and bring tears to your eyes. Which was what Wouk set out to accomplish."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved the mini-series so decided to give the book a go.  The TV series covered all the most important things from the book, but as usual there is much detail in the book that there was not time for in the series. This book is a good bet for  anyone who loves an engrossing story about a very important time in the history of mankind.  I learned a great deal that I never knew before, and I fancy myself somewhat of a history buff.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "\"Winds\" is a magnificent saga of the Henry family and their friends and associates told against a backdrop of the world events leading up to the USA's entry to WWII.  Navy Captain Victor \"Pug\" Henry travels the world doing odd jobs for FDR while Germany invades Poland, overruns France, and fights England and Russia.  In the meantime, FDR keeps the USA out of the war. After rubbing elbows with Churchill, Stalin, and Hitler, Pug finally finishes up his tasks for FDR and heads to Hawaii to command a battleship.  All Pug really ever wanted was a sea command, a decent shot at flag rank, and good lives for his family.  Wait a minute---Hawaii?  Isn't that where Pearl Harbor is?  When I read \"The Caine Mutiny\", I thought I had read Wouk's best.  Despite the rather narrower scope of \"Caine\", I still feel that way. Don't miss this one though, it's great."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I consider myself very picky when it comes to books. They have to be pretty exciting and well writting to hold my attention. Maybe I have A.D.D. or something. As the other reviewer said, there is a little \"they know we know that they know\" business in this book, but that didn't stop me from zipping through this book in about 2 days. I  give this book 5 stars because the style of writing just allows you to literally sprint through the pages without realizing you're even reading. it's seamless, and a breeze to read. i never once stopped to question something he wrote, and never once felt like i was \"outside of the story\". i'll be purchasing more of his books pronto."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I think James Bond should take a leaf from Alistair Maclean's books. His hero in this &quot;yarn&quot; defies description, someone who is smart, a little cynical, unwilling to give in to the momentary distractions of injury or beautiful spoiled women (who are actually great heroines in disguise!) in order to force the hand of the blackguard holding the world in thrall.  My most memorable scene in this book is when the protagonist is suffering from a bullet-ridden leg, yet hanging from the side of a porthole in high wind, trying valiantly to get past the villains that have hijacked this ship which has precious lives and gold cargo.  It's a real treat and an engrossing read, especially because it is so fantastic!  I would rather take a hero of Maclean's stamp than Ian Fleming's any day of the week!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The whole Patrick O'Brian are works of art and will grab you for Captain Aubrey's entire career.  Interesting to note how many obstacles he overcomes as he climbs the ladder of command in the Royal Navy.  Its a good primer for young folks starting a career; it is not always a rocket path to the top.  You will encounter traditions, rules, and technology that impede your goals; and one has to be a risk taker.  Again and again Aubrey takes risks, rallies his seamen, and prevails.  One wonders if a personality like Aubrey would be tolerated in our risk aversion US Navy today."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This series is really more like one long novel than a serialization. Again we find Lucky Jack Aubrey land bound and hoping for a command. Like in all the others he soon receives his hearts desire and the rest as they say is history. The semi accurate revisionist history is pleasing. The use of the archaic Royal naval jargon is like learning another language. If this installment we see more of Dr. Maturins true vocation as a spy. I highly recommend this installment to anyone who has read any of the past books."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm reading these books in series and I've just recently finished The Mauritius Command. I've given all the books in this series 5 stars. The title of my review suggests that this book is a departure from the first three. This is true, but I do not want to overemphasize that point. We get here all the things we expect from an O'Brian Aubrey novel. What is different is simply the amount of time spent on the various actions. In this book, I missed more of the intimate moments between Maturin and Aubrey, playing their instruments, fretting over money, and so forth. However, this does well perhaps to put us in the mind of Aubrey for this adventure.Readers of the other novels will not be disappointed here. And of course, the quality of O'Brian's writing cannot be overstated."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Jack Aubrey's dreams of success in the British Navy get a boost when he is assigned as the Commodore of a fleet near Mauritius. But, along with the glory of the management post, comes the hellish torture of responsibility  for the actions of several captains less capable than Jack.Aubrey and  Maturin finally fully join their mental forces in the attempt to understand  just what makes each captain in the fleet tick. Each at their own level  (Maturin's rather deeper), they form a concept of the other personalities  they must work with. And Aubrey ultimately finds that even the best  planning can be brought to nought by one committee or another...This  book also gives us a gently amusing glimpse of Aubrey's life on land as a  married man. As with all the Aubrey/Maturin books, this is by turns amusing  and thoughtful, as well as realistic and picturesque."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Over the years I have read almost all of the Aubrey-Maturin novels and I have enjoyed them, but this one was new to me, and was a disappointment. The engagements were all conducted against a kind of generic background, where in reality Mauritius in particular has a quite dramatic, volcanic skyline, and the fauna (the dodo had only recently gone extinct) still show the sort of evolutionary drift that should have transfixed Maturin. Instead we maneuvered in and out of bays and inlets that might as well have been off New Jersey. Shipboard life in the Georgian navy was as usual vividly rendered, but Admiralty politics, while referred to (Jack was made an acting Commodore for the assignment), were downplayed, and Napoleon was thousands of miles away. One got the impression that the French and British fleets were sort of killing time, fighting from force of habit. A potboiler, in narrative and purpose. Don't bother."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I can only say; be careful, because you won't be able to read very many other authors after reading Mr. O'Brian's work. I purchased and, in disgust, discarded several books immediately after reading this series; and did that each time I re-read the series. I will unashamedly admit I have read the Aubrey and Maturin series at least 10 times, and am looking forward to reading it yet again. So much of the drivel out there on the Bestseller shelf is written so that a person with the reading comprehension skills of a 9th grader can understand it (and let's face it, that's probably 80% of the folks in America), but that is not the case with these books.I, as you can probably tell, absolutely love this series."}

They should have had some more positive bands like 311.  I.C.P. should NOT have been there!  They REALLY made me mad when they sang  &quot;F**k The World&quot;. Other than that, the video was okay. They could  have put some better songs from the bands though. Especially from Godsmack,  Lit, and Metallica. Basically, the video was not bad."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "For those of you guitar music lovers, (mostly men, I guess), this is a great intro to three of the biggest names in guitar-centric music. More importantly, this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the first time I ever saw these three guys playing guitar. Satriani, Johnson and Vai. Each of them play 3 songs, and at the end they all unite and play together 3 more songs. This DVD is killer. The quality of the sound is just so good that you think you're listening to the CD. I sometimes turn on my surround sound and play this DVD and makes me think WOW! This is a must for any serious fan, or for anyone who loves guitar music. If I could give it a 10 stars, I'd give 10."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you are not an instrumental rock'n roll fan and your blood doesn't boil with some extreme overdrive and other guitar effects, this is not for you. If you are a rock guitar player, this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai, as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza, deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson, I have to say, has a very different personality, melodic approach, and technique from Vai and Satriani, but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "To anyone who, like me, only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death, this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program, giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here, all the banter between  songs, the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent, two seperate sound  mixes, regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Jeff Buckley left this planet too early, and what remains of his work still lovingly haunts and mesmerizes fans. &quot;Live In Chicago&quot; is priceless, capturing the essence of Buckley's live shows.Anyone who was fortunate enough to catch a Buckley show while he was alive will tell you that it is an unbelievable experience. This video captures the show in it's entirety, including Buckley's between-song humor.Highlights? Impossible to narrow down. Really. The bonus features on this disc are great collector's pieces - 2 rare acoustic performances from a cable access show, and an electronic press kit are included.No extra hype here - no fluff. Just a straight-up Buckley show in all it's beauty, untouched and as real as it gets. If you are a Buckley fan, this should be number one on your wish list."}

This concert, even if you dont know Jeff, is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album, and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great, try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Here is your only chance to see the great talent of Jeff Buckley, live and in person.  Sadly, he lost his life in a swimming accident, and the world will be diminished, musically, by this tragedy.  However, some of his finest work is captured here.  This concert gives the viewer a chance to see a young talent ply his skills with pure artistry. His guitar is captivating, and his voice is haunting.  Give yourself a musical treat, and pick this DVD up.  The only reason I gave it 4, instead of 5 stars, is because of a digital flaw in the song Lilac Wine.  The program stalls in this song.  I checked on more than one DVD player, and they both manifested the same pause.  Other than that... a great buy!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been familiar with Herbert von Karajan and the singers on this DVD for a long time before finally seeing them in action, and I must say, not one of them failed to impress, and each one of them is just as amazing as I had always expected.  This is absolutely one of the greatest productions of Don Giovanni, which just happens to be my favorite opera, in this whole world.  Von Karajan seems to be still at the peak of his power with the baton, and I just cannot say enough great things about the cast, especially Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Samuel Ramey, Julia Varady, and Kathleen Battle. This is a must-have in the collection of any opera/Don Giovanni lover!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I enjoyed this production of Don Giovanni, even though there are some aspects I did not like. The musicianship of everyone was excellent. The opera proceeded at a good pace. However I found the constant darkness overwhelming, even though the light background showing the city was very well done. Similarly almost all costumes were black, as if everyone, no matter what was happening, was dressed for a funeral, even those celebrating the wedding between Zerlina and Masetto. Although that is not their fault, Donna Anna, Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira appeared too old to make their passionate roles believable. The parts of Leporello and Don Giovanni were acted excellently: Leporello a servant, ambivalent, who enjoys, but then also dislikes his role; Don Giovanni: a very charming seducer, who can also be cruel, who does not care at all about the effect of his actions on others."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this video because my daughter loves dogs and other animals.  I also bought it because there is a segment on babies - as we are having a baby in a few months, I thought it would be good to expose her to little babies.  My daughter this loves this video.  She asks to watch it multiple times every day.  Sometimes we have to hide it.  She laughts at Elmo and really relates to all the animals and babies that are shown in the segments.The video is divided into 3 full length segments of Elmo's World - one on babies, one on dogs, and one on farm animals.  My daughter loves each one.  Plus they are very educational.  If there is a new baby on the way, I DEFINITELY recommend this video as a tool to teach your toddler about babies.  It discusses how to play with babies and what newborns are like."}

I play this movie several times per week for our two year old because she just adores watching the scenery and singing along with all the catchy and original songs.  This is a must have for any Elmo Fan!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This movie couldn't make up it's mind if it wanted to be a sex comedy  along the lines of AMERICAN PIE or a romantic comedy akin to SHE'S ALL  THAT.  It had the potential to be good whichever way it went, but it never  lived up to it in either one.  The sex jokes were uninspired and the  situations felt awkward and forced.  The romance wasn't really emphasized  and just not done very well, I felt.  Normally, you're rooting for the boy  to get the girl, but, in this film, I didn't really care.  I felt nothing  for the characters; I didn't even find myself rooting against the  &quot;villain&quot;.  Be it the writer's or the director's fault, it was  just very badly done.  The acting was decent and the dialogue was well  written, but the story development just left me feeling flat.  Disappointing."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Whatever it Takes is my pick for the worst teen comedy ever made. Miles below She's All That Never Been Kissed and American Pie and yes even worse than Can't Hardly Wait and the horrifying Melissa Joan Hart disaster You Drive me Crazy, Whatever it takes is boring an inept from start to finish. 2 guys join forces to help eachother get the girl of their dreams. 1 girl is the jock guy's cousin. The other girl is the best friend of the nice guy. It rips off a little Cyrano and a little She's all that. Complete with the cliched prom scene climax and the twist ending that you can predict from the first 5 minutes."}

He needs help getting Ashley to notice him, so in comes Chris (James), Ashley's cousin who is also very popular. Chris wants to date Ryan's best friend Maggie (Marla). He convinces Ryan that he has good intentions for wanting Maggie and that in the end, they will both have their dream girls, so Ryan agrees to the plan.Unfortunately, Ryan doesn't realize until it is too late that he's totally mismatched with his dream girl and that Chris is a total jerk.The cast is absolutely amazing, and they do a wonderful job. This is one of the best teen movies I've seen in a while.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to see a good romantic comedy."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "When I first saw the trailer to this film, I honestly wasn't impressed. It just looked like another pointless teen film (like &quot;She's All That&quot;). When I rented this film I wasn't expecting much. And when I watched it for my first time, I didn't get much. HOWEVER.. when I watched it again (a day later), I realized that this really is a great film. So what I'm saying here is, be optimistic about this film, or you may not enjoy it.Anyway.. in my opinion, this is a great teen flick!"}

Firedance is much better in it's original version where it's performed by a man and a woman.2.  I don't see why the Trading Taps needs to be included.  However, this is not to say that the tappers are not incredibly talented, they're just not Celtic!3.  For the same reason I've never really liked the Russian Dervish dance!4.  I also don't care much for \"Slip Into Spring.\"5.  And the original version of \"Lift The Wings\" is by far the best!6.  Colin Dunne is no Michael Flatly.Now, for the two changes that are good.1.  The narration at the start the talks about The Sun!  Yay Lugh!2.  The number called \"Heartbeat Of The World.\"  It's very good!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Watching the fast-paced Irish step-dancing that dominates this performance, you wonder how the dancers can keep from falling over their own feet, extensive practice notwithstanding.  Though there are a few segments that seem out of place (a flamenco dancer, a sequence featuring a black ensemble), most of the video is made up of dance numbers using traditional instruments and footwork from the Emerald Isle.  When I first watched it I was blown away.  I still am.  If you have only *one* dance performance video in your collection, this should be it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "There will never be a winner in the Flantley vs Dunne debate, which is perhaps appropriate, as the true star of the show is the music and dance, ably assisted by Colin Dunne, Jean Butler, Katie McMahon, et al.  The sheer  power of this production is overwhelming.  Even those who are not  afficianados of the dance will be enthralled by the pounding rhythms and  dizzying movements of the dancers.  The joy of Riverdance is apparent in  the interplay between the performers, masterfully captured in this video.  When the dancers are enjoying themselves, the audience feeds on the  enthusiasm, and a performance becomes a memorable event.  Riverdance - Live  from New York City is just such an occasion.  If I ever find a time  machine, I'm going back to catch the premier!  What a show!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Great music, great dancing, great story -- in short, sensational. Riverdance is STILL in a worldwide tour, years after Michael Flatley left. The hypnotic dancing moves, the romantic sweep and the Celtic rhythms are truly mesmerizing. In the past couple of years it has become hip to slam Riverdance, but that is only because of its stratospheric popularity. Riverdance is exhilarating entertainment that lifts you up and leaves you with simple joy in life itself.I can't think of anything we need more given the events of the past month.Peace."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It is heartening to know that people are still making films of this type. This is in the style of Happiest Days Of Their Lives or the St.Trinians films, but with younger girls. It therefore ditches any sort of sexuality in favour of a rather charming innocence. Even the teacher is a nun, rather than an Alistair Sim type. Having said that, these girls are no Von-Trapp angels. Director Daisy Von Scherler Meyer avoids the pitfall of casting precocious showbiz children and choses (mainly) sweet little girls who can act. The main plot about the girls trying to keep their school from being sold by crusty old aristocrat Nigel Hawthorne is spiced up with a kidnap caper which stops things wearing thin. On the whole, a good one to watch with younger children."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was hoping this would be a decent video about potty training.  It jumps around too much from character to character and from process to process.  Addresses washing hands before it addresses using the potty which it called a toilet and let's face it few kids / parents call it a toilet so that is another thing that irritated me.  I have always hated that shadow chick, and she is really annoying in this series.  And the \"potty time\" song with silloute stick figures is just plain stupid.  There was only one redeeming scene in the actual bathroom with the little brown bear, but the rest of this was total [...].  It is going in the next yard sale."}

Aside from the potty training he loves the singing and he loves all of the animals on the show. I also recommend Bear in the Big Blue House: Colors and Shapes. These dvd's are so cute my little one watches them every day!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was shocked to see Tchaikovsky's classic danced exclusively by males.  One reviewer felt that the result was a \"human\"-- not merely  \"romantic\"-- ballet.  I saw it as a travesty of Swan Lake.  We all know that gays have contributed much to ballet, but Nureyev danced with Fonteyn in the pas de deux from Le Corsaire.  A gay agenda should not trump artistic integrity.  The superb pas de deux by Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky in the other selection from Swan Lake did not remove the bad taste left by Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The trouble with this bleakly modern staging of Don Giovanni isn't that it fails but that it works all too well. Instead of the Faustian Giovanni of traditional productions, whose defiance is so appealing that one almost wishes him a better fate, Gilles Cachemaille portrays a sex-crazed psychopath who unquestionably deserves the psychological hell he's created for himself. Instead of the stock commedia Donna Elvira, we get a hopeless co-dependent. The cocky survivor Leoporello, traditionally a double of Figaro but less lucky in his master, becomes a self-hating neurotic with just a hint of masochistic homoeroticism. Don Ottavio, traditionally a satiric role, in the Glyndebourne production becomes the most stable character, the \"therapist\" for Donna Anna. And so on. All the roles are well conceived in this dark, Bergmanesque psychodrama. It's a good piece of theater!Oh, but what about the music? Unfortunately, it's not well-suited to the action, and perhaps should be replaced."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This \"Fancuilla\" is a bit of a mixed bag, an old-fashioned, no frills production, conducted and directed moderately well. Neblett, singing a signature role, is a bit melodramatic at times, and hits some of her high notes by force of sheer will. A not particularly pretty sound. Domingo, on the other hand, is magnificent. Dashing in appearance, passionate and sexy, he sings gloriously throughout. The DVD's overall sound is not all that good -- it was filmed, after all, way before the digital age. That said, I'm enjoying it very much, and can see myself happily pulling it out whenever I need a comforting Puccini/Domingo fix. This is a favorite opera of mine, and I'm not at all unhappy with the purchase."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Overall I loved this performance, especially the performances of Domingo and Neblett.  Yes, she may have been overtaxed in the role at times, but for me the chemistry between the two of them was wonderful.  He with a soft edged machismo and she as the tough woman in the wild west but with an obvious feminine side.  I found both the characters very believable.  Carolli was acceptable but not great.  Wish it had been Milnes as in the recording on the DGG CD.  The production values are good but the age of this recording shows.  It definitely does not have the sharpness of more modern recordings.  I've not seen the La Scala DVD mentioned here but I've heard it on CD and while Domingo is as good as always, I find Zampieri's voice just plain ugly."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Fanciulla should be lively....rugged men, perky young gal.... but Neblett acts like a 40 year old school marm and is not helped by the ponderously slow tempi.  This ain't Wagner!!  Phrases that should bounce and sparkle are more like dirges.  Domingo is ordinary as usual, but sings a bit better here than in the Met production.  I usually like Carolli, but not so much here.......rather stiff and one dimensional.So why did I give 4 stars.........the sets and costumes are fantastic.  Altho Minnie's cabin has elaborate china and stuff you would never expect in a wilderness cabin."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Handel's late oratorio is giving a magnificent reading in this modern staging, taped at the 1996 Glyndebourne Festival.  Baroque specialist William Christie leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and a group of spectacularly talented principals who bring great sensitivity and drama to some of Handel's most achingly-beautiful music.  Daniels, Upshaw, Croft and Hunt all sing ravishingly (pay special attention to Croft's wonderful first act aria).  The Glyndebourne Chorus is spectacular, and gives wonderful treatment to the great choral sections.  Avante-garde director Peter Sellars gives the piece a modern treatment that holds interest, if not providing any revelatory moments.  Technical aspects are superb.  Highly recommended for the Handel completist, and a great introduction to this beautiful score (considered to be Handel's personal favorite)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was my first time seeing anying by the Australian Ballet and I was very impressed.  Costumes and sets are beautiful.  Pavane and Horsman are very talented performers.  I really enjoyed the second act in the Dr's \"workroom\".  The members of the company who \"dance\" the various \"dolls\" are great especially the one who performs the floppy, unformed, unsculpted \"doll\".  Also worth noting is that a friend who knows nothing about ballet easily understood the story without help from me or any other source."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Coppelia has always been my favorite ballet (to watch and to dance).My friend and I decided that we wanted to see the ballet again, after several years of not seeing it, so I went on Amazon to see what was out there.  I'm really glad that I chose the Australian Ballet's version.If you read the other reviews, yes, there are some differences from the 'classic' version of the story, but it's done really well and the dancing is phenomenal.  If you're looking for a great version of this ballet for your collection, pick this one up, you won't be disappointed.(this, from a professional ballet dancer. Well, 2 if you count the friend I watched it with!)  :-)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've just now (minutes ago) finished seeing this film for the first time.I'm awestruck.Had this film been made by anyone other than Fritz Lang I'd have thought it impossible in the context of a film circa 1931.  Peter Lorre's performance as a child murderer is incredible.  His pleas for mercy when being \"tried\" by the underworld bosses is amazing.  The director spends an entire film making you hate his character and in a matter of seconds, Peter Lorre makes you understand the pathos, the compulsion, the madness that drives him to do what he does.  He relates real pain, real self hatred and true madness.  The cinematography is PERFECT.  Every aspect is flawless.  All this from a film made nearly three quarters of a century ago.It's in German.  Subtitles.  Big deal.  If you're even looking at this, you need to see it, period."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Honestly, after reading some of the wonderfully written reviews here I cannot see myself even attempting to better this excellence.  Just going to say I watched it today and was astounded.  I originally started to watch it in English but as soon as Lorre came on, realized he didn't do his own voice-over. Stopped and begin the subtitled version. The imagery in this film will blow you away. Lorre is perfect in the part.  I've mostly seen him in comedic roles, the exception being CASSABLANCA, so this was a good opportunity to watch him strut his dramatic chops.On a lesser note, I enoyed seeing life in the 30's Germany. The washboard and the wash tub, the way the rooms looked as well as the way people dressed.Now, go read some of the other reviews. You won't be sorry."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Peter Lorre is great  as the man who kills children.  M is an excellent film.  A man is killing children and the police are going after everybody with a record, so the criminals band together to find the killer to get the police off their backs. How these desperate characters work together makes a very compelling and suspenseful story.  Directed by Fritz Lang, who also directed the Sifi masterpiece metropolis, does a great job on his first talkie. Shortly after making this film Peter Lorre fled Germany and Fritz Lang followed shortly there after as both men were Jews.  I would highly recommend this movie.  It is in German with English subtitles, and after a while you don't mind reading them."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is what every filmmaker should try to produce.This film is difficult to rival.  It was and still is an influential movie that discussed reality with realism and never shied away from continual controversy.  One of the first films about a serial killer, with details ripped from the headlines and extras ripped from the streets.Peter Lorre is a genius in this film.  Even though you know everything, he still manages to illicit some sympathy from viewers.  Lang is excellent at creating a story that draws in his audience and captivates.This movie also solidified Edvard Grieg's \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" as a terrifying piece of music.Although made in 1931, this film looks and feels well beyond its time.  This new edition of this film will ensure its legacy to continue well beyond as a masterpiece!Highly recommend for anyone, especially those who consider themselves cinema connoisseurs."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This film left me numb. The final scenes hit me with a power I had never before experienced. Peter Lorre plays a child murderer (immaculately, I must add) being pursued, throughout the course of the film, by not only the police, but the underground crime syndicate as well. Lang's use of the newfound sound technology is absolutely brilliant, as is his visual style. The opening scene shows shots of empty alleys, stairwells, and a lost balloon stuck in power lines over the sound of a mother calling for her child, instead of showing the actual killing itself. And its worth seeing for that alone."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If he did it could have been Fritz Lang & his seminal talkie, M, made in 1931 & released in 1933. A deranged child murderer is loose in the city (played broadly & wonderfully by \"newcomer,\" Peter Lorre).The movie has scenes pitting citizen v. citizen, in accusations & counter accusations, near lynchings & mob hysteria. The police seem helpless & bereft of clues. Organized crimes seeks to find the murderer also. He's bad for business.Crowd mentality is examined. It is a theme Lang returns to in later movies. His first American movie, Fury , (1936) deals with vigilantism & mob rule. This version, a poor print by the way, has English subtitles so you're forced to pay attention. It was Lang's favorite film. It is a prototype, if you will, of the murder mystery genre. Kind of a precursor to Hitchcock's thrillers of the 40's & 50's."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a chilling film about a child murderer who terrifies a Berlin neighborhood.  The police seem to focus on the lowly criminals and prostitutes in the area and seem more interested in making a show of the hunt at least in the beginning.  The community members are terrified and numb at first then become activist in hunting for the killer.  Police eventually bring in skilled investigators who come close to catching the killer.  The people use a blind possible witness for better effect.  What happens to the killer, who captures him and his explanation form the essential thought provoking finale.  Capital punishment, evil deeds and uncontrollable compulsions are discussed and become part of the story.  The psychological background of the killer, the police and the community were ground breaking at the time.  The DVD comes with a story booklet, several interesting documentaries and quite a lot of information on Fritz Lang and German film-making at the time.  I found all very interesting.  Loved them."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is one seriously disturbing movie. Fritz Lang created several masterpieces (e.g., Metropolis) in his career, but M is unique. This was Lang's first \"talkie\" and to be honest the dialog means little to your ears if you're watching M and can't understand German (you can read English subtitles - very well done in the recent criterion release on DVD). Yet the \"talkie\" nature of M is critical when Lorre's character whistle's chords from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt before each chilling moment. I found this use of a simple repeated musically element to be one of the most effective I have ever heard in a film. If you don't like subtitles M won't be your cup of tea, but if they don't bother you then check this movie out. You'll have chills for a while I promise! 5 stars!*This review is of the Criterion 1999 version."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Ok... in my book, you can't miss any film that has the great Peter Lorre in a key role. While this film was most likely intended to make a statement about society, it translates nicely as a finely crafted story of a manhunt for a despicable murderer of children.The Criterion dvd features a very nice print, and considering this is in the early day of sound film, maintains a clean soundtrack.Like the best of post WWI German films, M makes people look at themselves and question the power that leads, or misleads. The gray area is surprisingly broad when presented in such a skilled way. This film merits re-watching as the arguement proposed in M leaves further questions, rather than answers.The sharp editing and stark imagery make the technical execution of this film a classic and paints society itself as ugly as its own nightmares."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Fritz Lang's M features a young Peter Lorre as a psychotic child murderer on the loose in Germany. His performance is chilling. The rest of the cast is also excellent as they portray various levels of society reacting to the murders and participating in the hunt for a serial killer. Lang uses music and lighting to great effect and the film is gripping from beginning to end. It is in B&W with English subtitles. For lovers of classic films this is a must see. It showcases a master at work in the creation of an atmospheric horror story with minimal technology and special effects.  You can honestly say after watching this \" they don't make them like this anymore\"."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is without hyperbole one of the best movies ever made.  When I first watched it, I was absolutely riveted.  While German cinema of this time period (1920s-1930s) was certainly edgy, experimental and deeply rooted in the social issues of the day, this movie stands above the rest.  It's one of the very first movies to examine the social problems of serial killers, pedophiles, mental illness and mob rule.  And all of this is delivered with Fritz Lang's incomparable film-making style.The newest Criterion release is definitely the best available.  Not only does the film look lovely with its new transfer, but there are plenty of informative extras to keep Lang's most ardent fans happy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have to say i give the crew behind TMNT a lot of credit, dealing with the low budget they had, and able to create the wonderful costumes for the turtles. I'm not good with the names of the people in the costumes but i have to say, they are truly talented in the 3 movies in this series. This movie does seem to slow down in the middle of it, but the fight scenes are amazing. A lot of great directed shots by Steve Barron, this is probably one of his best. With the low budget they had, they were limited on set design, which is noticeable, do to the fact, that some of the shots are actually from New York, and the house that they are in after there first encounter with The Foot is a real house. As we can all tell, the costumes probably took a great deal of percentage out of the 13 million dollar budget. But overall, this movie is just plain fun, and great adventure."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The comic book and cartoon heroes come to life.Back when this movie first came out I was like 5 or 6,so I loved the Ninja Turtles from watching the cartoon and having the action figures.The movie is still enjoyable,even though I am now 19.The characters were develped very well,and the movie does a good job introducing the story of how the turtles came what they are.Besides the turtles and splinter,there is also Casey Jones and the Shredder of course.The movie is dark,made where it can be appealing to adults as well as children.The DVD version of the film is pretty cool!The picture in nice quality,not grainy,and you have your choice of viewing it full screen or wide screen.The sound quality is pretty good too.A real bargain and a real treat for Turtle fans."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were the cartoon craze I remember growing up.  I was so happy someone finally put the movie on DVD.  While this movie wasn't great as far as technical standards it still did a great job capturing the story line and personalities.  I thought maybe I had outgrown the turtles but as soon as I saw the movie again I was hooked.  I couldn't wait to find an original Nintendo and start playing the TMNT game again.  You've got to own this part of independent film history."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Yes, this movie is a classic. I feel very lucky to have grown up when the Ninja Turtles first became popular. This was back at a time when thought and care went into children's entertainment. Unlike the stuff kids are watching today. All of the characters in the Ninja Turtles series have distinct personalities and they're all lovable in their own way. If you loved this movie when you were a kid you'll still love it as an adult. Sure, the movie looks dated but it is far superior to the recent kids movies out there like &quot;Power Rangers.&quot;"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have always loved this movie.It was everything that the other Ninja Turtle movies were not.It was dark,and was a bit serious,but at the same time,there was humor in it.Both kids and adults could enjoy this movie.Although there is a few violent scenes(such as Shredder's death) that some parents might not want their kids watching...but that's up to the parents.Overall though,this is a really good enjoyable film.I thought the other Turtle movies were complete crap.I wish they would come out with a two disc special edition of this,with deleted scenes,commentary,and other cool stuff,because this is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time.Right up there with Tim Burton's Batman and The original Superman movie in my opinion."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Parece que la extraviada (Traviata)realmente esta muy enferma al final ya que la escena esta incompleta. esto no deberia asombrarnos ya que Zeffirelli hizo algo peor con su Otello con su recortada aria del Sauce. Excepto este detalle no tan importante como el Otello, la pelicula es muy bella aunque para los puristas, entre los que me incluyo humildemente quizas por mi condicion de Profesor de Apreciacion Musical, encuentro en ella tal como note en la Carmen de Migenes y Domingo, ruidos innecesarios que en la presentacion en un teatro serian imperdonables; al fin y al cabo lo importante es la musica y no los extras caprichosos de Zeffirelli. A pesar de estos pequenos detalles la presentacion es maravillosa; las cuatro estrelas en vez de cinco obedecen a estas para algunos quizas necedades. Para mi repito, soy un purista y pienso en la intencion siempre del compositor. Recomiendo la version de Beverly Sills y ni se diga la de Angela Ghiorgiu, superiores excepto los tenores ya que Placido Domingo sigue siendo el mejor."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Only the film version of Carmen tops this breathtakingly beautiful and sumptuous production of La Traviata. During the overture we see Violetta towards the end of the opera, nearing her tragic death. She looks more like a phantasm, especially when seen next to her lovely portrait, painted when she was radiating beauty and health. Act one thus marks the start of Violetta reminiscing about how she and Alfredo fell in love. This is a most effective beginning, and as this is a film it gives us unique new insights into one of Verdi's most well-known and beloved operas. As such, it allows us to view the opera with new eyes, making us fall in love with it all over again. The singing and acting of Domingo and Stratas are outstanding, although that of Cornell Macneil is somewhat stiff. Aside from perhaps tradionalists who believe that opera can only be performed in the opera house, this film version is sure to please opera and non-opera fans alike."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I think opera, as a tradition, tends to stagnate in, well...tradition. It's good that opera is also being expanded to the media of today. This for-film movie production takes all advantage that the video medium has to grant, without the limitations of a traditional filmed stage production. The acting is perfect (Domingo gets better every time I see him, and this performance tops the cake). The casting is very appropriate (Stratas is indeed the sickly prima donna!). Also, the cinematography and camera-work are the work one might expect from Hollywood, not from opera: superb!All in all, buy it for its creativity."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I like this movie a lot because of the good performance and excellent photography.  Domingo's Alfredo is still good enough however, Stratas's Violetta is not good at all in Act I - her voice is quite annoying and it seems that she cannot adjust her breathing while she is singing - things become better when Germont shows up in Act II.  Sound quality is much better than that recorded in an opera house, so is the image quality.  It's a good choice for those who do not really enjoy opera (just like me) or who want to try something different."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As I understand it, this film was a revolution at the time, with Zeferelli opting for shooting as for a film rather than filming a stage production. As another commentator commented, the miming is not always perfect and lip movements and sung words don't always match. However, the sound of one of Verdi's greatest operas is wonderful and the soloists are great. Domingo is in his prime here, not only a splendid voice but also a great actor, and Teresa Stratas does an equally great job as Violetta. The production is gorgeous, a feast to the eye as well as the ear, and the party scene, with two stars of the Bolshoi Ballet in the starring dancing roles, is absolutely breathtaking (\"He really didn't do that, did he? Omigosh, he did it again!\"). A must for all lovers of opera."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This adaptation of Verdi's opera La Traviata is simply sumptuous and a lavish production. Never before than an opera is transformed into a beautiful film. Ms.Stratas and Mr. Domingo performed and sings with pure gusto and it is a sheer delight. Set designs and costumes are a credit to the production and director Zeffereli excels in his delivery of this opera and presents it as a movie experience. Music performed by The Metropolitan Opera orchestra conducted by James Levine and the music thoroughly shines all the way through.I truly enjoyed this film experience and enjoy the music and performance."}

It has remained one of her favorites even though she is now a SR in college (majoring in chemistry).The colors were vibrant and the animation is super! Voice talent was superb, including Dom Deluise.

(Some analogies are present here.)  During the storm boat trip, Fievel is lost at sea, and he finally washes up ashore in New York Harbor, where he vows to find his family.With the voices of Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, Nehemiah Persoff, and Christopher Plummer, this story will warm your heart.

When he arrives alone in the New World, he keeps up hope, searching for his family, making new friends, and running and dodging the cats he thought he'd be rid off. An American Tail easily one of the best animated features ever made, but it proves to be leaps beyond the efforts of recent Disney movies by refusing to be constricted to an all too familiar formula. A heartwarming story, beautiful songs, great performances and the animation is stellar. This is an excellent movie for all ages that will warm your heart"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This sequel to \"An American Tail\" is a fine animated film full of Old West Americana; the stuff legends are made of. It is full of great characters and you may even soon forget that you are watching an animated film. The story and dialogue are that good! James Horner seems to have really come of age with this memorable score. It is as much homage to Copland as it is to the American West. This was James Stewart's last theatrical film. This is a good and entertaining family film, which expounds virtues of loyalty and honor. Highly recommended viewing!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a really cute children's movie in this series. It's the next one after an American tail. In this one we find the mouseskewitz heading west taking a train hoping life will be better than in New York. On the way to the train station to head west to Green River Fievel falls off the train. Meanwhile Miss Kitty Tiger's love interest tells Tiger she's heading west as well. Tiger decides he's going to head west to follow them and he falls off the stage. Both Fievel and Tiger wind up in the desert and eventually meet up and the adventure goes on from there. It's an interesting story and it's full of adventure for the little ones. It is defintely worth getting."}

The new version of \"The End\" recorded in Arthur Barrow's studio(Lotek in Venice, Ca)is hypnotizing. If you want a behind the scenes update of \"The Doors\" - this is it.  I thought it was very interesting to see Ray Manzarek's apartment in Venice, Ca where they lived and Jim Morrison lived there with them for a while.  The films \"Evergreen\" and \"Induction\" that Ray put together while at UCLA was also intriguing. Too much great information, film, and music to list all here. Get it - you won't be sorry you did."}

If you're an obssesive fan of CSNY and Sly & Family Stone like I am, then you have to buy this for their real live songs. That adds up to a great 10 or 15 minutes. The Rascals, Janis and a few others are live and decent, but wait till you can get this for $5 bucks, not $20. James Brown without his band! It's a crime against humanity. Most of this you will watch once at most.I mean Smith? They walked right out of the Billy Jack movie.Do you want to see David Steinberg and Lily Tomlin before they were famous, or funny? Some day Sly and CSNY will put out decent DVD's of all their live performances. C'mon Neil!"}

Unfortunately back then there were no VCR's to purchase or record it from the tv- we had to sit there and watch the entire movie at one sitting and take bathroom breaks during the commercials-how lucky kids are nowadays to be able to have videos/dvds in their home library.

I'll admit that when I was growing up I had little affection for BAMBI but some of the vivid images have remained with me up to this day.  The Great Prince all alone as the hard snow falls in a deafening silence is unnerving and almost unbearable to watch. Yet, his father is there to finish his upbringing and they walk off to his adulthood. As I return now I see the tenderness and harsh lesson we all must endure. Simply told through a brilliantly visual medium this film is so appropriately conceived for its honesty and celebration of life and nature. It has now become a favorite."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid of about seven or eight.  I didn't realize that I was just a couple of years younger at that point than my dad was when the movie was originally released in '42.The beginning shows the superior artistry in telling the story.  It comes across as real woods.  For the most part, the animals behaved like animals (though I don't think deer talk to rabbits in real life).The best part of the DVD is the story board, where they go through the movie with the creators telling their thoughts about what to do and comparing it with previous movies.One part of the movie that is fantasy is that man is the only predator.  In real life, the old wise owl and Flower would be preadators as well.  Coyotes and wolves and mountain lions and bob cats were all absent from this forest.I found this a very scary movie when I was young.  Parents would want to watch this with their kids, especially young ones."}

Sporting an incredible new transfer this edition shines light years beyond the previous VHS incarnation.  Colors appear slightly brighter and the soundtrack rings crystal clear.  The extras on this platinum edition are varied and quite enjoyable as well w/the OLD MILL short  animated short being my favorite. Another 1 hr and 10 min extra delves deep into the meetings and processes that formed this classic.  Deeper than most Disney films and second only to Snow White sits this incredible testament to animation and Walt Disney's genius."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Bambi isn't just one of Disney's best animated features, it truly is a work of stunning art.  Really.  The entire film is so gorgeously imagined, choreographed and executed that it may move you in its sheer beauty, not to mention the fact that it is a wonderfully layered story appropriate for nearly anyone anywhere.  It is fascinating to watch it as the precursor to nearly all of Disney's later triumphs, perhaps most of all The Lion King.  It is essentially the same story, told through a different species.  Even the settings, and the dramatic use of nature as integral to the scenic look of the film, recall so many other, later Disney films.  Your children will love it, and yes, they'll be devastated by its most heart-wrenching plot twist.  But it's also a wonderful way to introduce bits of life's crueler twists of fate -- and to discuss them as a family.  Bravo Bambi!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "All about a young male deer and how the phases of its life parallel the cycle of seasons in the forest. This is a perennial favourite from the genius of the Disney studios.  I've always thought that the beautifully done APRIL SHOWERS sequence - which reveals the forest at its most mysterious and beautiful exemplifies the superb craftmanship which is seen in every frame.  Here the world was introduced to Thumper who, along with Jiminy Cricket, Dumbo and the Seven Dwarfs became a favourite with children everywhere.  Based on the famous story by Felix Salten, this low-keyed and gentlest of all the Disney animated cartoons is a timeless delight for children and adults alike.  The film's total commitment to its portrayal of the seasons and elements of nature set a pattern that Disney would follow years later in his true-life adventure series.  As in all the past Disney cartoon features, colour and music played an important part in helping to create mood and atmosphere. A beautifully done animated gem from 1942."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this movie and had my three plus yr old watch it and I couldn't believe how terrified he was. I had to keep forwarding the scary scenes. I had no idea this was such an old movie. The music sounds like church music and is not something I consider for kids (Remember it is rated G). The video may be remastered but the audio quality is poor and one has to turn up the volume to listen to the dialogue which makes the scary scenes even more so. I think this is an age old format of story telling which needs to revised. Unfortunately Disney keeps repeating it through movies like Incredibles."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Given how Bambi is no longer a Disney hottie, I was thrilled to own it on DVD, and for our kids to meet some of the older Disney characters.  They love the book, and this film would be one of the first they read, then watched.I noticed some differences, though I don't recall it vividly since I've not seen it since its original theatre release. Still, I thought the older art form was well-maintained, and the story relatively intact.  Watching it now, I found the leap from Bambi's youth to maturity quite abrupt, and I recall as a child finding that somewhat confusing.  My little ones did, as well. It took them a few minutes to realize the new young buck was Bambi.In all, I think it's worth adding to a classic Disney home collection.  I enjoyed the special features, also."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First off, I would like to thank Amazon publicly for providing me with a copy & the opportunity to review this much-anticipated release.  The folks at Disney have pulled off a remarkable feat in restoring this 1942 classic.  Nary a bit of grainy picture nor the usual pops and blips that normally accompany films of this age.  It has been completely revitalized and the audio has been given the \"enhanced home theater\" treatment which means you can watch it in a great new 5.1 mix or a restored version of the original mono soundtrack.  I found the enhanced version to be much more preferable.  This would be a great addition to any Disney DVD collection and look forward to \"Cinderella\" in Oct."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Sorry, Peter, but I grew up.Actually, it's more than that. Wendy is not exactly a feminist, after all, and the Indians are not in any sense Native Americans. The jokes about them are not the sort that would be acceptable today. And it's too late for the dream of a boy who never grows up. We've heard about \"The Peter Pan Syndrome,\" and I even married one. That was Husband Number Three, actually.There's also the fact that it's very much a boys' story, and for more reasons than the unrealistic depictions of females: Wendy, Tinkerbell and Tiger Lily. Even as a child, I didn't see the point to the fake combat against the Indians and the pirates. And I considered Peter impossibly arrogant; I still do.I would not recommend this to your children and grandchildren, unless you are prepared to do a good bit of explaining the differences between 1953 and 2012."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The very best Peter Pan ever made for film. I am sure we are not the only family that loves this movie together as a family. We have to watch it every year at Christmas , 4 generations gather around the TV sometime during December to watch Peter Pan and a few other family favorite movies. We just love the animation and the way in which the story is told, it makes you wish Neverland was real and we could all be kids and play forever. We love watching our gandsons pretending to be Peter and fighting Hook. A huge bowl of homemade caramel corn, and beverage of your choice have been found by our family to only enhance the viewing pleasure!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Classic Disney movie on Blu-Ray, though not without a few reservations. There are screenshot threads comparing the blu-ray with the VHS and I feel that this bluray is a worthy upgrade without too many awful mistakes like on the Cindarella blu-ray or others like Little Mermaid (has been recalled), Robin Hood, and Sword in the Stone.  Luckily it wasn't edited or changed to make it any less-racist, so it's still the Peter Pan you remember :-)  But the transfer is a huge step up from the awful DVD that was released a few years back."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was always one of my favorite Disney movies.  I am happy to say that it is now one of my 2 daughter's favorites as well.  We got the DVD when it came out and they have watched it over and over.  All I can say is that I am glad that DVD movies don't wear out like VHS or Beta.The clarity of the images is fantastic.  Disney re-releases are always beautiful and this is no exception.Special features are great for the adults or older children.A definite must have for any family, but especially for those of us who remember or, more importantly, can't remember what it was like to be a kid."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "You can fly You can fly, you can fly!!!! Where the imagination can take you into far away lands you'll never forget TinkerBell! Don't we all love her! I'm troubled by the depiction of native americans though. What makes the red man red? I think this is the only set back to the film there's some prejudice there that I'm not happy with. Don't we all wanna stay as children? We all miss our childhoods. This film is by far one of the best films to relive your childhood."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "&quot;Peter Pan&quot;, the 2nd Disney Classic that I added to my DVD library is another keeper. Another favorite from my childhood, the film is still a great experience to watch. The animation is still classic, as is the story. Of course, the appeal of the film has changed for me, from what it was when I was a kid. It is now a classic animation film, rather then just a cartoon.I was suprised with Disney didn't announce that this film was going to be part of their &quot;Platinum Editions&quot;, but this DVD (while no extras) is still worth the purchase for the film its self. The picture is adequete as is the Dolby Digital Mix (Adequete for an animated film that is).If you are a DVD Collector, you should strongly consider purchasing this DVD, and all of Disney's Classics."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like many other thousands of people I am a huge fan of Disney animated classics so I am very happy that this edition of Peter Pan is available.  I always had a very active imagination as a kid and it kind of dwindled away as the years rolled on by so it is always enjoyable to watch this movie and think of never growing up.  The story is so fun and magical.  Now a little down side to this movie is I don't want my kids to try to fly out a window!!!  Do you think Michael Jackson is trying to have the face of Peter Pan it really does look like him with the large eyes and very small nose?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Our family voted PP as the 2nd best Disney movie, behind only The Lion King.  It has something for boys and girls of all ages, including the 2 things that make a movie truly great for my 9 year old son&#65533;  swords and sword fights.  This is a movie we have owned a long time and it gets watched several times per year.  Pete&#65533;s Dragon is our most watched movie period but PD came in 3rd.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work.  All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad.  Peter Pan is no Codfish, we rank it #2.  Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly.  Peter Pan was 2.  Pete&#65533;s Dragon 3, Beauty & the beast 4 and Sleeping Beauty 5."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "An evergreen animated fantasy based on J.M. Barrie's beloved children's book, Disney's \"Peter Pan\" features dazzling hand-drawn visuals, excellent voice acting, and a winning score epitomized by the song \"You Can Fly!\" Rendered by Driscoll, Peter is refreshingly cocky, and even Tinkerbell has a bit of an impetuous streak; Hook, of course, is as dastardly as ever. Made by the same team that later created \"The Lady and the Tramp,\" this thrilling, imaginative tale bests the 1923 live-action original, and leaves most other versions in the (fairy) dust as well."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a great movie.  It's funny, well written and tells a wonderful story.  However, I'm sick of this steryotype crap. Give me a break people, this movie was made a long time ago, when they made movies with a decent story line, and didn't compromise that to make all the poor little people happy.  Looses up. Don't talk to your kids about it being &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;  what next burn it 'cos it's offensive? Give me a break. Let peoople make movies properly, and don't worry about offending everyone in the world.  Most people aren't offended and out dumber those that for whatever reason are. Get a life."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Both the video and the sound on this BluRay are state-of-the art. The colors are really true, and are a little bit darker than they were in the previous DVD release (as can be seen when you watch the extra features which were produced for the earlier DVD release and feature color that has been \"corrected\" into a brighter, more-pastel-ish look). The outlines of the animated characters are also sharper in this BD release than in previous issues.The extra features in this set are substantial and very interesting. I won't discuss them here, but I will say that you're really missing out if you've purchased this combo set and don't avail yourself of watching the extras.A great release from Disney.Highly recommended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When someone asks &quot;what is your favorite Disney movie&quot; I usually reply, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; or &quot;The Lion King&quot;, as do most people. There is one Disney movie, which almost everyone loves, yet always seems to forget, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. This is one of Disney's most wonderfully brilliant and magical movies ever. It combines the joy of childhood with the seriousness of growing up. I remember watching it so often that I wore out my video. Anyone of any age can enjoy this film...and will."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "\"SHANGHAI WENDY?\", the pirates reply.!!!  That's what I say!!!Captain Hook is, his fellow pirates say, \"the world's most famous crook\"!If it weren't for Peter Pan, I would not have a name!  I'm most grateful to be named after Wendy Darling, a most gracious heroine and foster mother to the Lost Boys of Never, Never Land.  I'm so glad too that Disney left out the ending where Wendy grows up after all, gets married, and meets Peter Pan after so many years of separation.  What a rotten ending, I've always thought, so glad this version ended differently.There's not really a moral to the story, just a fanciful adventure/children's story of innocent kids battling Captain Hook and his cohorts.  Another Disney classic!\"Say your prayers, Hook!!!\", Peter Pan replies when he saves the day!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Olsen twins star in this great tale of halloween adventure. Their family is going through some tuff financial trubles and may lose their house so they turn to the only member of the family with any money- a cruel aunt. Upon arrival they are immediately dismissed- but the young twins presence frightens the mean aunt because she was once a twin herself and she did something very horrible to her own twin. See- their cruel aunt is a witch and used a spell to make her twin vanish and now its up to mary kate and ashley to uncover the plot and save someone they have never met. They find help with a little person and a grave digger and set off around the town trying to learn more about their evil aunt's witches coven.

{"label": 6, "raw": "After reading the book by Michael Lang, the man who thought this whole festival up..(\" the road to Woodstock\"), it put it all in perspective for me! Watching the artists perform was simply amazing! I loved it!! The music.. the People.. the interviews have brought me right there! I still can't get Richie Havens Out of my head And that's a beautiful thing! Nor Santana for that matter!! They laid the groundwork for the vibe that was the Woodstock Festival. 10 stars!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Anyone who knows Woodstock through the audio releases or the original video will find this a great update.  The performances are enhanced with Blu-ray quality, the sound is greatly enhanced and the extras are a sweet addition to the package.If you're like me you've probably owned several versions of this recording.  This is likely to be the definitive version, with lots of extra footage that included performances and footage I had never seen before.  It was a bit pricey, but all things considered, this is probably about as good as it will ever get and I couldn't pass up on the opportunity to have this in the superior Blu-ray quality.Woodstock was the event of a lifetime, certainly one of history's defining events that deserves to be enjoyed again.  This is the perfect way to do it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Honest to God being of the Woodstock generation I had Great expectations from this release, and was very disappointing with the resolution and the editing of this version. I was really looking for something that looked like at least somewhat close to the original theatrical release but this fell very short. The Audio is barely OK and sounds flat (dynamics are lacking in the music)and the added footage does not add much to the film.In addition I would be hard pressed to say it's a Hi Def film. The contrast in many parts is just poor, and no it's not my set. I have a newer set that was rated pretty high, and I have never had this issue in concert films. I guess I would say except on vintage poorly non Hi Def films that were poorly transferred. Over all I can not see anything about this making it look or sound like a newly Remastered Version Hi Def  release, Nothing!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First let me say that I was the idiot who thought that this contained the whole Woodstock concert (all days and all footage). Instead, I got one or two videos from each artist. I wanted to see all of Jimi Hendrix's concert or all of Janis Joplin's. Sadly, its not here. A friend said I'd have to find and purchase a different dvd and that costs alot more. I give it three stars because I did enjoy the videos that were there and they made me feel as if I was at the concert. If you are looking for the entire concert with videos of all songs from each artist, this is not it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I really loved this version.  I had watched the film on cable,  but it never filled the HD screen.  I have no idea, but I decided to purchase the 40th Anniversary which is also the Director's Cut.  The film deserved it's Oscar.  It is a Time Capsule of a time and a place that has never been reproduced (but they did try).The ratio is not full HD, but the screen is much larger, performers get longer sets, more music.  For anyone curious or to see what this was all about, you cannot go wrong with this set."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Just got this last night, and I have to say it's stunning.  I purchased Woodstock as an excuse to purchase a blu-ray player, and I'm happy I did.  The colors pop, you see detail you never saw in the original DVD.And yes, some of the songs have been \"repaired\" with added instrumentation, which I have NO PROBLEM WITH.  I suppose it would be immoral if they didn't tell us they did it.  But they told us.  They even made a video to show the process, which is pretty amazing.So quit complaining and turn it up!And oh yeah, groovy.Kaz"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was 20 years old in '69, didn't make it to Woodstock, even though I only lived 200 miles away in Vt. On this 40th anniversary, I am kicking myself repeatedly! I just bought the 40th anniversary directors cut boxed set and love every moment of it. But for me, I keep going back to those precious few moments where the three nuns are walking through the crowd. The wonderful smile and the spontaneous peace sign -FROZEN IN TIME- it just cuts to my soul! I can't help but wonder what ever became of that young lady in the blue habit. I have a feeling she lived a very PEACEFUL life.God, I wish I'd been there!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "While I like the multichannnel remix overall I'd say if you already have the Directors cut DVD then I wouldn't spend the money on the Blu-Ray.  The picture on the DVD looks the same on the Blu-Ray which makes sense since I would guess that the original footage was shot in 16mm.  The audio on the other hand sounds much better than on the DVD. If you're an audio purist than you probably won't like the multichannel mix, but I'm not a purist so I enjoyed it.  If you haven't seen the Director's cut then definiately buy the Blu-Ray.  The extra footage is worth the price."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I also have this movie in it's many various incarnations.  The Blu Ray 40th Anniversary, the original VHS and DVD release, as well as the director's cut DVD.  So I go and by this 40th Aniversary DVD for my office (which unfortunately does not have a Blu Ray player) specifically because I wanted the extra performances that are on the other 40th Anniversary discs.  Creedance, Johnny Winter, The Who, Canned Heat, Airplane, etc.  Wrong! Not here. Even the extra documentary footage that's on the other 40th Anniversary release of Wadleigh, Dale Bell, Scorsese and many others speaking on the events surrounding the filming of the movie is not here.  Just some cheesy Story of the Sixties film.  Totally dissapointed.  What really made me angry is that there's no disclaimer stating that there's huge differences between this \"40th Anniversary Edition\" DVD and the others that are available.  I just gave it away."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A great introduction for those who missed out (like I did), but not so much a documentary or a concert. I supposed it is very difficult to fit 3 days into the time alloted, but it's oftentimes very difficult to watch as  some songs are cut short... the cameramen can't find the subject they're  shooting... the filmmakers often focus on mundane topics rather than  grabbing the full excitement of the event. Don't get me wrong - it's a  great piece of history - it just doesn't seem to capture the best of it,  IMHO."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Woodstock was the high point of the late sixties.  It was a time of innocence and pain.  It was a time when we who were young were members of a tribe - we cared for each other and shared visions of a better world.  Yes, there were problems - bad drugs, lack of sanitation, and the like.  But it worked in its time.  The movie captures this mood so well, both in the interviews and in the music.  The multiple frames help to show the different aspects of life at Woodstock so well.  I'm not sure if those who are younger now can truly understand why Woodstock was so important - maybe this film will help them to understand."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I love Woodstock.  I must have seen the movie as a midnight show several times in the 1970's.  I bought this edition because of the promised unreleased footage, including CCR.  It is NOWHERE to be found on the two disc edition I received.  Apparently, there is a third disc containing this in some special editions, but NOT the one I got.  I am still glad I bought it, but cannot recommend it to others for this reason unless you know what you are getting."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was a really terrific film.  I wish they could've made a series of films like this to capture the entire festival, but this comes as close as we've got I guess.  As it was, I felt transported and when it was over, I was sad to leave it.  Really glad I got the director's cut!  This is a great historical document that captures not only the music (though I wish there were more), but the climate (political and natural) surrounding the festival as well.  Whether you were there or wish you could have been, this is a great trip!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this DVD for Santana's Soul Sacrifice.  In my opinion, this is the highlight of the whole concert.  Michael Shrieve's drum solo is unbelievable.  Imagine 400,000 people dancing in a muddy field, all at once!  Crazy!  Santana stopped the show!  Ten Years After and The Who rocked the show too, and of course, Jimi Hendrix ripping on guitar.  I gave it 4 stars because there's too much talking.  Some talking parts are long and drag on and on.  They could've been replaced with more music.  Otherwise, a really good movie."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Without question this was a landmark movie. Some of the greatest acts in rock and roll were able to perform in this movie. The movie going fan was able to see the Who,Joe Cocker,Janis Joplin,Jimi Hendrix,Sly and the Family Stone, Richie Havens, John Sebastian and the Loving Spoonful as well as many other up and coming stars in the world of music. The music in the movie was very good. The on the scene footage was also well shot. You were able to see Woodstock from every perspectivein this movie. That this video is till available 32 years lateris a testament to this event. Buy this and watch it. It is a collector's item."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wow! I saw this movie when it first came out at the theater. Amazing film. So many big performers. This has some extras that are worth watching. Probably the beginning of drug abuse/sexually transmitted diseases in this contry and who knows what else. I still would have liked to have been there. Nothing compares to this event. Not something to sit and watch with your kids unless they are in their late teens. This is where Ten Years After really go their big start. I mean you have Janis Joplin, Hendrix, Crosby, Stills and Nash (who got there beginning here) Richie Havens, Country Joe and the Fish, Santana...the list goes on."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was thinking of buying this item, but after reading the reviews, and finding out just what is NOT included in it, I said SKIP it!! All the other bands that did not make it to the previous versions are NOT on here. I guess in order to see them you have to have a BLU-RAY player, which I don`t have, and in these tight times, do not plan to get.(In my opinion BLU-RAY is a waste of money, once you get used to it, you would`nt want to go back to standard, so your hooked on it and its higher prices). This is a NOT SO SPECIAL EDITION. How many years will it take before the regular people can have the full version. Maybe I`ll get the 50th anniversary version! PASSSSS!  \"Hey You, Get Off Those Towers\""}

It's stupid to mention but for perfectionists and collectors its worth noting as that very plastic sleeve wil keep dust off of it. So now I have turned the plastic upside down and slide the cover over the DVD box as opposed to sliding the box into the plastic. Works great now!

{"label": 6, "raw": "Although it was before my time, as a big music fan I took the opportunity to pick this film up when I saw it on sale. I can see why they tried to re-create the feeling  of these times by staging woodstock 94 and 99, unfortunate that 99 ruined a great thing.  If you like music from that era, this film is a definite must have. The who, Hendrix, Joe Cocker to name a few, but many other as well. Interesting look into Flower power. I don't nessesarily agree with everything in the movie, but this is an important American Documentary.  Something for any Music person to watch at least once in their life."}

The animation is excellent and the voices also but the story and atmosphere in the movie are just majestic. It's such a great adventure battling eternal questions such as good vs evil and logic vs magic it has great messages for children and adults alike. All should see this movie."}

I still have the tape, but not the Disney Channel.James Earl Jones makes an execellent bad guy named Omodon.

The front picture is misleading, if you look at the back of the DVD it's more true to form. It's a great inspiration to me, I couldn't be happier with the film. I bought one for twenty four dollars and it was hard to find. This is more organized, and classically done. I wish I had this one instead, but I bought this because my family loves this film.

The songs in his films were often poor quality, but not so much in this film.If you are a new Elvis fan and want to see a high quality Technicolor transfer of a great classic romp....this is my pick for his best movie.  The only other one that came close to this was \"Fun In Alcupulco\" (sp?)Enjoy...and Viva Las Vegas!!"}

If you are not familiar with The King's movies, this one would be a great place to start. The fact that Ann Margaret's dance numbers in Viva Las Vegas have been so frequently immitated speaks for itself.Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I still remember her performance in State Fair when she dazzled a young Pat Boone. In this Elvis movie, she plays a swimming instructor who does not like him at first. Near the beginning is an interesting number where they trade opinions of each other, Elvis liking Rusty I think her name is, and she not liking him. Of course they eventually fall in love with each other, but a car race and getting Elvis' car ready to run is more important. It was really funny watching the very voluptuous Ann-Margret get covered in motor oil while working under his car, but then she also does a number about following her mother's advice. She is some dancer, but Elvis is some singer with moves of his own."}

Who knows why...maybe she wanted more than they would pay or was touring during the production window but its a bad blow to the package...still for its price its a great value. I should ad that I have an IMPORT 2 DVD set of the movie TOMMY and she is all over that one with interviews etc...you would think she'd be proud to be on this?the 24 Page book that comes with it is nice added value as well."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "My husband and I were skeptical.  I bought this DVD on a whim and it stayed in its wrapper for 2 weeks before we watched it.  Our baby fussed for 2 hours at night, fighting sleep, but obviously exhausted, well fed, and wearing a clean diaper.  My daughter fussed while we watched the video and we calmed her right there as we watched the techniques.  We can get her to sleep in less than 5 minutes, rather than try to calm her fussing for over an hour, like we had done before.It really works!  We are now the Happiest Parents on the Block!  Our baby is calm and well rested.  We are less stressed.  We are giving it to all our pregnant friends as part of their baby gifts."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought several meditation CD's from Amazon but \"Goodbye Worries\" is by far the best.There are 4 different sessions on this CD, so it is kind of like getting 4 for the price of 1.  One of the other CD's I bought claimed to be a \"half-hour of peace\" but when you take away the introduction and the music at the end, it was only 15 minutes.There are currently 30 reviews for this posted and all of them give it 5 stars.  This is the best $10  I have ever spent.  Buy this CD.  You will not regret it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "One of the most beautiful records ever made. The \"Master Edition\" sound quality lets you truly hear the heartrending tone of these tenor giants. Beyond jazz, this will move anyone with a pulse. After seven tracks that leave you emotionally stunned, where you kept turning it up to savor every nuance of tone and feeling, you suddenly get the sound of a recording engineer barking into a mike! The fools just had to fill some unused CD real estate and mar one of the most beautiful records ever made with some let's look behind the curtain \"Blues for Yolanda\" outtakes! Why not use \"Maria\" and \"Cocktails for Two\", tracks from the same session I've found on other compilations? So be ready to shut down your CD player after \"Shine On Harvest Moon\". Grafitti on the Mona Lisa, fercrysakes."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Some might say (including historians, musical producers and liner notes writers) that Hawkins was much better than Webster, that only Young could equall his power with his unique approach. Even if this is true, the level at which Hawk and Webster play is so high that I see the meeting of two true giants.Impecable rhythm section led by great Oscar Peterson always helps at these Verve style encounters and I feel that both tenor plays made the best of it. Whether it is gentle ballads, blowing the blues or harmonizing in rhythm, this CD should satisfy not only swing and mainstream fans but also modern jazz fans: mainstream by definition leans somewhat towards modern jazz and Hawk and Peterson particularly well blend the best of both worlds (as they did throught their careers; Hawkins even before modern jazz was born).A classic."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've always adored \" Scooby Doo\" since i was 8 and this movie was a excellent comeback for him, i saw this on Cartoon Network and thought it was great.It's the story of Scooby, Shaggy and friends who take a vacation in a southern made Island to investagate a strange going on, now they discovered that the Island is cursed by dark forces including the undead, will they make it out alive or end up as bait for the darkness?Very entertaining and thrilling Scooby flick inspired by the old 40's voodoo flicks and Lucio Fulci Italian horror flicks, this is a must see for fans of Scooby or Zombie lovers.Similar movies recommended: Lucio Fulci's Zombie, City of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Cat People, An American Werewolf in London, Day of the Dead, Lucio Fulci's The Beyond, Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Return of the Living Dead, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie and Creepshow."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Dame Joan obviously could not be compared to her prime at her farewell performance. However, that was a very good decision to say farewell to all her fans in this glorious and very seldom performed opera.She still had a very good stage presence and did not have to \"die or go mad \" at the end.The final farewell scene was impressive, I don't think any opera singer ever had such a sumptious farewell occasion. It showed how her fans loved her and would missed her.That was in sharp contrast to how Pavarotti bid farewell to her fans in New York.Both occsions would be well talked about and remembered.I wished they have taped the OONY concert performance of the same opera at Carnegie Hall last year.That was a memorable performance."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Come on, guys. This is just about as good as you're gonna get nowadays. Yes, the ol' girl is past her prime. Yes the tenor is squally. But when will you hear a better cast? Not in our lifetimes, I'll bet! (Though try the Opera D'Oro CD with Corelli and Sutherland.) The production values are pretty good. Orchestra is fine. Most of the cast hit most of the notes. Let's just admit that we don't have singers anymore who can perform &quot;The Night of the Seven Stars.&quot; If you want to see this opera, this is it. Okay?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Yes, as everyone else says this is not the quaint fairy tale that Dvorak envisioned (and it is sung in sometimes garbled English), but it is an original and terribly moving evocation of a similar story--an unusual, different sort of being (a wood nymph in the original, here a young adolescent) who longs for a perfect, \"normal\" relationship and is left tragically betrayed and alone, if loved very briefly.  The staging is starkly modern and at the same time Victorian (it makes Robert Carsen's Paris production with Fleming look very derivative); the singing is always heartfelt and impressive, although Rusalka (Hannan) has a few weak moments especially in act 2.  The orchestral sound is generally good although the winds are at times strangely wobbly.  But the final effect of this version of a quintessential romantic score is a revelation of deep human meaning that most traditional productions have not touched (including the Met one).  Beautifully filmed."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The eqipment used to make this movie was only fair. HOWEVER, for good reason this my favorite. The performances of The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Otis Redding, Janis Joplin, and more, are terrific. It is quite fun to see Mama Cass's reaction to Janis Joplin's \"Ball and Chain.\" The ending of the festival is fantastic-- Ravi Shankar's group plays the longest and most wonderful raga, or whatever one would call it. Have you ever listened to some performer-- and the performance is so incredible that at the end you stand up applauding? The performance has literally pulled you out of your seat? Well Shankar's raga pulled everyone out of their seat-- even Micky Dolenz of the monkees. I have owned the video for 20 years or so, and it is by far the best 60s rock concert I have ever heard.-- Sam Yulish, author of WHERE HAVE ALL THE HIPPIES GONE and THE HESITANT PSYCHIC AND OTHER STRANGE STORIES."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The historical significance of this video is when Jimi arrived at Monterey  he was an unknown and before the concert Black artists in Rock music besides Arthur Lee of Love were big at that time in the &quot;Soul&quot; catagory only.  Hendrix understandably  nervous came thru big time and broke all stereotypes.  Monterey is clearly his best concert video for entertainment purposes with Jimi playing behind his head, the burning antics at the end, his funny comments between songs and the audience reaction to seeing him for the first time.  Also included in this film is some good background information on the Monterey Pop Festival by John Phillips.  If you're looking though for straight guitar playing, Jimi is better at &quot;Berkeley&quot;."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This concert is one of the greatest of all time. The performance of Alice, his band, and the whole \"Nightmare\" concept is absolutely ahead of it's time, and still holds up today. Alice set the standard in theatrical rock. Sure, he was a little drunk, but so what? He still put on one hell of a show- this is pure sick and twisted theater.  Accept no substitutes. This production and concept changed the face of live rock and roll performance. So many bands and performers have copied, and been directly influenced by Alice Cooper. Even U2 used his \"movie screen\" idea in one of their stage shows.The whole \"Welcome To My Nightmare\" album is performed, along side original Cooper band classics, like \"I'm Eighteen\", and \"Billion Dollar Babies\". Recommended!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I just finished watching this DVD. IT SUCKS! I thought it was the TV Special. It was Alice Cooper's concert for the album. The video is bad. So is the audio. The cover says it's \"REMASTERED\". If this is remastered. I'd hate to see the original. If you're looking for the actual TV Special, look for the one that is under 120 minutes AND does not include his hits from the previous years as this disc does. SHAME ON RHINO FOR GIVING US THIS CRAP!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the best Darin DVD available - Bobby died several months after this performance.  This incredible DVD showcases better than any - and better than many of his CDs- the range of talent this man embodied.  From \"Beyond the Sea\" to \"Midnight Special,\" you get 200 percent of everything Bobby had to give. His energy in this performance is incredible, almost as if he knew it was his final. What's more, this performance had not been thoroughly rehearsed, Bobby had his oxygen sitting backstage to take hits from between songs, and if you watch closely, you'll see him working to get blood circulating through his hands. This is Bobby Darin at his cumulative best and shows what he could do with a song that no other vocalist can do."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Having had the absolute pleasure of attending many of Bobby Darin's performances in person, as well as, being in posession of MANY of his LP's/CD's, he has proven over, and over again, to be the consummate all-around entertainer/actor/singer/musician.  Although I have been a fan of Sinatra and Sammy Davis,Jr. for many years..NONE could surpass his magnifcent artistry.  He just absolutely ran \"circles\" around EVERY great performer who has ever lived.  His untimely death on Decemmber 20, 1973 was an absolute loss to the entertainment industry....\"bar none.\"  That date will be forever etched in my heart and soul, as well as, in my mind.  Personally...that was the day \"the music died.\"  Never, in the future, will there ever be an all-around performer that could EVER come close to this phenomenal TALENT!!!!!!!  May GOD BLESS YOU, Bobby."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am a huge fan of Bobby Darin but this video is just terrible. Instead of hearing Darin songs I want to hear I'm forced to hear songs like \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and \"Midnight Special\" might I add these songs are performed terribly. He sings Mack the knife And Beyond The Sea but he sings them boringly (is that even a word) and lame. no enthusiasm at all. I wish they would give out a tape of him in his earlier years so it would be more entertaining."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I already owned Into The Woods and was in awe of Ms. Peters' performance in it, so I purchased this. I was astounded at her performing and vocal ability, and much more astounded when I found out her age (exact words: &quot;but, she's so HOT!&quot;). Except for &quot;We're In The Money&quot;, all the songs and/or performances are wonderful (some of the songs were only made interesting by her rendition). Also, if anyone who heard she will be playing Madame Rose in Gypsy is doubting her ability to play the role, they ought to see her rendition of &quot;Some People&quot; on this video."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Tina Turner DVD is in DTS and it sounds wonderful. The image isn't bad either, but it looks a little soft--almost like it was filmed instead of taped. The concert was recorded in Amsterdam, so maybe there were some PAL  to NTSL conversion issues. Or maybe the producers just wanted a softer  look.This is a high energy DVD. You almost get out of breath just  watching it. Most of the songs are up tempo and have lots of energy. Lights  flash, scenes change rapidly. It's very effective. I found myself squinting  from time to time when a bright light was shown on my monitor."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I read the reviews on Amazon.com and bought it (DVD) on the strength of the ratings. It is, without dispute, the best concert I have ever seen. We have a 63&quot; big screen and a full digital pro-logic system. I felt like  I was there! &quot;Missing You&quot;, on the DVD is spellbinding as are  most songs. The musicians are extreme professionals and the dancers did not  miss a beat. If you can only have ONE concert DVD, this is the one to have!  It is crisp, flawless and breathtaking. I thought I knew her music, now I  don't know if she could beat this one. It's like Michael Jackson's  &quot;Thriller&quot;...one of a kind, never repeated in it's intensity. Get  it!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I will try to be as bried/concise as possible:&quot;Live in Amsterdam: Wildest Dreams Tour - DTS DVD&quot; is one of the best DVDs ever released. The sound quality and 5.1 channel mix is truly amazing.Listen to how the whole stadium sings along with Tina while performing &quot;Simply the Best&quot;. It gives you a true feeling of a live concert. Just close your eyes and imagine yourself at the stadium...watchng this legendary performer act for you...just for you.I can't stop watching this concert over and over. If you are a true Tina fan or just like good quality music, YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS DVD! Now we are waiting for the final Tina Turner Video Music Compilation 1991-2003 exceptionally in DTS sound !I wish there was a regulation or something forcing the DVD manufacturers produce their music DVDs in DTS sound only."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have to agree with the earlier reviewer that mentioned the bad sound recording on this DVD.  The visuals, of course, are as wonderfully Tina as expected.  I don't understand how and why the sound is so &quot;strange.&quot;  ... even though their are two versions (of the sound) from which to choose.  I'm not sorry that I purchased it, however.  This is my favorite Tina Turner concert.  The selection of material is perfection and the energy comes across like a volcano erupting.  I love Tina more than ever, and look forward to her next DVD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am a big Tina Turner fan who personally thinks she sounds better on record, than live.  This concert is enjoyable, but after awhile her voice is annoying because she tends to scream.  Tina has a good voice, but not great, in my opinion.  Her studio recordings have always sounded better probably because she can do them again and again until she gets them perfect. Concerts don't allow such luxuries.This DVD is available in a 5.1 surround sound version, or DTS version.  I have the 5.1 surround DVD and it is more than adequate.  I have to ask why the concert wasn't filmed in widescreen to give the viewer more of a feel for the concert.The DVD also includes a lengthy interview with Tina where she discusses each track of the then new album &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;.  The interview, while promotional based, is very enjoyable and contains video excerpts for each album track."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Unfortunately there is not a lot of Neil Diamond available on video. Greatest Hits Live is rather hit and miss. Filmed before a small audience at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988 it appears that Diamond was just going through the motions.The performance, while it does include some of his best work, seems oddly disconnected and lifeless. The mix is adequate but nothing special. There are times when the camera cuts to a member of the band and you can't really hear the instrument he is playing.I have seen Mr. Diamond twice before and I know that there are better performances out there. The song selection could have been boosted to add some more of the classics.All in all you need to take what you can get but this DVD is disappointing."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A mixture of several of his hits.  There are some omissions such as \"Be\" (from Jonathan Livingston Seagull) and \"Holly Holy\", but it includes several of my favorites, such as \"America\", \"Sweet Caroline\", \"I Am I Said\", and \"Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show\" (I still wonder if that song is meant to mock Christianity or rather to paint the picture of an old tent revival).I will say that I prefer Diamond's vocals on the Beatles tribute than the original."}

I felt just like the little girl I used to be watching him on TV while screaming and crying. I still can not believe MJ is no longer with us. Get this DVD you will no be disappointed! It's so clear the videos chosen are perfecto. I just wish that it wasn't a two sided disc so I dont have to flip the disc over for the rest. Nevertheless, MJ will live in film & history forever. I am so grateful to be able to obtain this collection my only regret is that I didn't get it years ago."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I went to Hollywood Video & rented this on VHS & let me tell you when I saw it, it completely renewed my interest in Michael Jackson. I went out & bought the DVD right away. No matter what the press says, he is truly amazing & one of a kind! The 1995 MTV performance is just show stopping & the proof is in the standing ovation he gets when he finishes. I also loved the Blood on the dance floor video because for the first time, it shows Michael partner dancing with another girl which looks hot. I like the teaser at the beginning & it has a better version of the Smooth Criminal video than the Number Ones DVD. It even includes the legendary Motown 25 performance where he performs Billie Jean & for the first time, does his iconic moonwalk. This DVD is a must have for all fans & those who want to see some of Michael's best work!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was awesome! I purchased this and my whole family and I enjoy watching it over and over. It is priceless entertainment for our family. I am glad that I purchased this collection. I also purchased the Dangerous short films, Video history one, and the Michael Jackson Dangerous concert.. All are awesome and make a great collections. I would like to see a dvd with all of MJ's videos on one dvd instead of several here and there. For instant man in the mirror is on the number one's dvd.. I would have liked to have seen that on one of these collections. With that said, theses are still great to have. I don't know if I will purchase the number one's dvd. I think you will enjoy all the ones that I have mentioned. Get ready to be entertained."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wow! After watching all of MJ DVDs, I now know why Michael is the greatest entertainer who ever lived or will ever live. No one even comes close to his level of artistry. And each of these videos is a masterpeice. Childhood, Stranger in Moscow, Smooth Criminal and Earth Song are just astounding. You can watch them again and again and never get tired of them...they're candy for your eyes. You just don't see many vidoes on this caliber. And the MTV video music award performance is unparalleled. Would highly recommend this!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was the very first video I saw by Ozzy Osbourne.  I really liked it from the start, but it seems to get better and better every time I watch it.  This video shows Ozzy and his band performing in a few different shows.  I think it's interesting to see more than one concert.  The songs are great, the ones that were chosen are the very best from his career.  The band performs well and Ozzy's voice is excellent.  There is also Ozzy performing Black Sabbath with the original members from that band.  It's neat to see them all together again.  This is one of my very favorite videos, regardless of type.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Once upon a time, say somewhere between 1994 and 1997, I'm convinced that OASIS truly was the meanest, biggest and bleedin' greatest band alive. They held the world in their hands and threw it on a roller coaster ride, of which a piece is caught in this video. Noel Gallagher had the talent of 100 years of composers together, Liam had enough charisma for a millennium. Yes, it was there and then and today's Oasis perhaps only have the shell left ot these days - but it doesn't really matter, since the wonders this band made during these years (perfectly sumaried in this video) is enough for a thousand lifetimes. Even if they won't live forever, this will!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This release was taken from their two shows at Earl's Court and Maine Rd in England.Kicking off with the jam fest that is known as &quot;The Swamp Song&quot; and then smoothly gliding into the duet &quot;Acquiesce&quot;, this is a good indication that the boys know how to rock.There isn't a sour note to be found here especially when Noel sits down on his stool for another rendition of &quot;The Masterplan&quot; or his otherworldly guitar solo in &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;.It was a bit odd to see Oasis perform &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; with a Beatles look-a-like, tribute band. Tongues firmly planted in cheeks?The one thing that keeps this video from being consistent are the interview bits they throw in between songs. I have to fast forward through them. Sorry guys.This is a better concert video than the previously released &quot;Live By the Sea&quot; as it shows Oasis at the height of their popularity, on bigger stages, in front of larger crowds, giving their all. Outstanding."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "not bad in terms of seeing the bad boys of boston behind the scenes in the studio but bad in terms of dvd entertainment - no special features, no menu, there isn't even any artwork on the disc.I think I speak on behalf of most Aerosmith fans when I say that the record company needs to release an Aerosmith concert on DVD for us. They must be the only band in the world that don't have a live concert to buy whenever you walk into a virgin megastore or a wallmart! It's frustrating! They should have even released an &quot;OH YEAH! GREATEST VIDEO HITS&quot; to coincide with the CD &amp; the dvd could have had special features to make up for the songs without videos - for example big ten inch live, dream on live, etc. Surely this would have been more exciting to us fans than this!!No wonder Aerosmith don't get the recognition they deserve if you cant even buy a concert or video compilation on DVD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you're a huge Aerosmith fan or like learning about great rock bands then I highly recommend this DVD!  Aerosmith is my favorite band of all time.  This DVD has 2 sides.  I loved learning about how much time goes into making an album and how they come up with songs.  I'll definitely be buying other Aerosmith DVD's and learning more about them since they haven't been on Vh1's Behind The Music in forever.  I highly recommend buying this.  It's definitely worth your time and money."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I love RATM. I was at the Irvine Meadows concert shown in this video - unfortunately, that one is the worst of the ones shown. It was a great show, but it's just poor quality. Part of that is because it's at night,  but it also seems kind of poor anyway. The other shows are pretty good, but  the video has flaws. The video collection is cool though, although the ones  from the first album are basically just Rage live, they're awesome."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Included on this DVD is footage from two concerts, two appearances on television's \"Austin City Limits.\" I thought this was easily the best of the three Stevie Ray concert tapes (DVDs) I've seen. All of them are good, however.Most of this is from the 1989 concert but I enjoyed the three songs from the '83 concert the most. They seemed to be the most intense and the most impressive. The latter adjective mainly describes his work on \"Voodoo Chile.\" To my knowledge, Vaughan is the only guitarist to successfully imitate the late-and-great Jimi Hendrix. (Although SRV's vocals aren't as good.)After 40-some minutes of rocking blues and rock, there is a change-of-pace and beautifully done jazz instrumental called \"Riviera Paradise.\" Featured on that piece is keyboard player, \"Reese Wynans,\" who does an outstanding job.This is a feel-good, great music and most of it would make for a good aerobic-workout music, too."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you are a big SRV fan you'll  be happy to have this.  Is it top quality?  Does it include as many songs/performances as I'd like? No and No.  However, I am thrilled to have this.  Even before he got clean, SRV just knew how to perform each and every time because the music came from deep within him.  I am so glad he sobered up and was able to help others.  He is an inspiration as a musician and a insightful human being.  Glad he lives on despite leaving us in physical form."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Stevie Ray's first appearance was in 1983, along with Tommy Shannon on bass guitar, and Chris Layton on the drums (Double Trouble). There are 3 songs from that show, on this dvd: Pride & Joy, Texas Flood, and Voodoo Chile. Stevie Ray's 2nd appearance was in 1989. This time he had added Reese Wymans on keyboards, to the band Double Trouble (containing Tommy & Chris).I like both appearances, but I like the 1989 appearance the best. The songs include:1.The House is a Rockin' (This is written in large letters, on top of the front doors, at the Hard Rock Cafe in Houston, also they have a big replica of one of his guitars, mounted and revolving on top of the Hard Rock Cafe Houston.)2.Tightrope3.Leave my Girl Alone4.Cold Shot5.Crossfire6.Riviera Paradise7.Tick Tock8.Litte Wing (bonus video, showing legendary blues guitarist, and the manufacturing of guitars).Thanks!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Stevie Ray Vaughan was one awesome guitar player and underatted singer. The footage of the two concerts is a joy to watch. The second concert is a little better because it feature the talents of keyboardist, Reese Wynas who is a perfect foil for Stevie.However, this video should be so much longer. It clocks in at a mere 63 minutes and features three songs from one concert, six from another, the closing credits, and video clips of great guitarists with Little Wing playing in the background. All these scene changes are disruptive to the viewer. Also, more songs are needed. Nothing from the Soul to Soul record.Whereas Stevie Ray was a blue ribbon talent, I am sure there are more comprehensive concerts feature this late legend."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I first discovered Stevie on Austin City Limits. I was just blown away by his playing and singing.  I don't think I have ever viewed such a passionate player - Body and Soul.  There is not one wrong note -- it's complete bliss.  I was lucky enough to see him about four months before he passed, and it was the most fantastic musical experience of my life.  I remember it like it was last week.  He played with everything he had and it was beautiful.  I've been listening to him for years and I never get tired of him."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you are a guitar player, you know what a talent Stevie was.A huge loss to the music and more specifically the guitar world.This was my first DVD pruchase and I love it.If you critique the sound, and are dissapointed with it, you are missing the point. Simply watching Stevie play was enough for me. Makes playing the guitar look easy, which it isn't.The contrasts between the two Austin performances was good, giving us a look at two phases in Stevie (and DT) music career.A &quot;must&quot; purchase for the guitar player, and, a great addition to anyone who can appreciate good blues and rock music.Missin you Stevie."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The first place I saw footage of this concert was on youtube and let me tell you I was blown away. The allman brothers band perform there best songs. So when I heard there was an official dvd release I was beside myself with excitment, That is until I read the reviews stating that this dvd only shows short segments of these performances intertwined with interviews and all I could think was WHY! why would the people in charge of releasing this do something so completely idiotic. This is a complete tragedy to think that this concert exsist in full on vhs but only in bits and peices on dvd. I can only hope that one day this company will have the common sense to release this in full as it was originally intended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I used to have this on VHS and was ecstatic when the DVD came out.  Although the VHS was itself not the entire show at Great Woods (which is what we really want), nonetheless, what we got was terrific.  But it's just a travesty what happened on the way to the DVD editing room.  It's all chopped up with interviews interrupting the solos, truncated and/or missing songs.  It's so irritating that I will never view it again.  Now, if this show (with Warren, Allen, Dickey, Greg, Marc, Butch and Jaimoe) were re-released without the horrible edits it would be a \"must have\".Until then - avoid it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Great concert - the Allman Brothers at thier best since Duane and Berry passed on. Better than live at The Beacon - that should be a bluray catalog as well - it's plenty new enough.  The problem with this DVD is the interviews as others have stated.  They could have been added as bonus content to select off the menu rather than have them embedded in the the concert itself.  Please re-edit and possibly reissue as a bluray with full concert footage and non embedded \"added\" bonus content. Classic Allman Brothers - Its the right thing to do........."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like a lot of reviewers here, I bought the VHS edition when it first came out...nothing but the highest praise for that version.  There is perhaps no better single video that so superbly documents what these guys do onstage  ( at least not with Dickey Betts in the lineup ).  I was fortunate enought to have stumbled upon the DVD for rent first...which I did, and that was it, for reasons stated so well by everybody else here.  By the way, the VHS tape can be copied to DVD, which I heartily recommend!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This film, shot in Texas in June of 1995, features a whole host of talented musicians.  The littany of names is enthralling.  Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt, Jimmy Vaughan, Robert Cray and Eric Clapton, who was  nominated for best male rock performance in 1997 at the Grammys for his  performance.  Each musician performs his own incredible piece and the film  also includes each performer's reflections on Stevie and all culminating to  an incredible blues guitar jam with each musician having a solo.  Filled  with beautiful slides, riffs and solos and heartfelt thoughts each artist  pays tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan in his own way. A befitting tribute to a  once in a life time bluesman."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "James Taylor performs almost two hours worth of songs at a semi-famous theater in New York City in the late '90s.These are mostly great songs, about every hit song he ever had and more, and his voice is in fine form. The only problem I found was that it got monotonous after awhile. Although likable, Taylor is not exactly an animated performer, nor are his shows. After a half dozen or so tunes they all start sounding similar.  Lately, though, I've seen him on other venues like Eric Clapton''s Crossroads Guitar Festival, and Taylor is very animated!  Guess he's getting spry in his old age!Here, though, he isn't.  He just stands there and sings. This is better just played as background music while you are doing something else. In other words, it's better served as a CD rather than a DVD.But it's an excellent concert as Taylor and his band perform beautifully."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "James Taylor is such a brilliant songwriter, singer and performer, and he is one one of the few artists who has remained on top year after year. I am not speaking about the charts and selling the most records, but about performance. Listen (and look) to this excellent performance! All the classic songs are here, some of them sounding even better than on the original recordings. The musicians are in good mood and totally inspired by James and his songs. The perfect DVD when you need inspiration! (...)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "James Taylor and his absolutely KILLER Band tear the roof off of the Beacon Theatre in NYC. Not an easy feat by any stretch of the imagination.  What is even more incredible is the fact that longtime JT drummer Carlos Vega, committed suicide the week before this show was taped. Carlos was an incredible talent and may he rest in peace. JT called on an old friend who was definitely up for the task of learning the 30+ song set. Mr. Steve Jordan does a marvelous job with all of JT's classics as well as his newer material. His band is top notch as well! Buy this DVD, you won't be dissappointed!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "James Taylor at his best. Although this concert is shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio, it is crystal clear.  The audio has a Dolby Digital 5.1 option which sounds great.  This has always been a favorite album to test a system with.  New Blu ray audio and video technology notwithstanding, a good system will enhance this and other older DVD's.  The editing is also top notch with quick cuts minimized. The back-up singers almost steal the show, but James is in good humor and fine voice. Taylor has been, and always will be one of my favorite singers, able to span generations and song styles. A great concert that sounds great too."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Mr. Taylor is a troubadour of the ages.  He and the artists he assembled for this production are nothing short of incredible as they hit every note with grace and craftsmanship.  The production quality approaches that of The Eagles \"Hell Freezes Over\" DVD, however, I still feel the Eagles hold the honor of producing the benchmark DVD to measure all other concert DVD videos by.  Nevertheless, this concert is a close second and will captivate any JT fan.  \"Shower the People\" actually brought a tear to my eye, sooo sweet! The sound quality of the DTS is exemplary and the DD 5.1 holds its own.  The camera work is right on the mark and the quality of the video is crystal clear.  Plug this DVD in and experience the Beacon Theater's warm ambiance from the front row and beyond. I've played this DVD dozens of times and look forward to the next."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When funding for school music classes were being cut all over the country people kind of brushed it off as a non-necessity.  Studies prooved that many kids prosper in other academic subjects when taking a music class.  Art should be available for all kids in school as well as sports.  This benefit concert brought awareness to that.  Mariah, Celine, Gloria & Shania all appeard to support the cause.  And of course Ms. Aretha Franklin.  The performnaces were great.  Carol King was brought out as a special guest of Celine Dion.  The best part of the show was when the diva's sang You've Got A Friend and Natural Woman.  This show sounds even better with the 5.1 sound."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Celine Dion is definitely the biggest highlight from the first ever Divas Live. Her solo performances of River Deep, Mountain High and My Heart Will Go On are impeccable. Everyone agrees that her My Heart Will Go On performance on this show is one of her best and most memorable yet. She also does The Reason with Carole King. Shania Twain performing Man!I Feel Like A Woman! and You're Still The One also contributes to making this show better than it would have been with incredibly mediocre Gloria Estefan, incredibly annoying Mariah Carey, and incredibly over hyped Aretha Franklin. MARIAH CAREY IS NOT A GREAT SINGER!!!!!!!!It was awesome to see Celine rightfully upstage Aretha in the finale. Classic. Aretha may be the Queen Of Soul(ick) but Celine Dion is the Queen of ALL singers! The Canadians rule the day here, folks!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've been a fan of Gloria Estefan for years and have purchased and enjoyed many of her audio CDs.  This is the first DVD I have purchased and it is truly disappointing.  The music was wonderful, but the productions were terrible.  To me it took on the look of one big strobe light!  There were so many flashing lights in the backgrounds, foregrounds, above, below, from helicopters that most of the images were washed out and appeared overexposed and ghost-like.  Certainly not flattering to someone as attractive as Gloria.  Too bad, but this one is going to be discarded.  If you're over the age of 15 and appreciate good entertainment, then you're wasting your time with this DVD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This DVD is absolutely incredible and possesses one of the best images I've seen on a music DVD so far. The musical content is magical as Gloria Estefan takes us through her journey as a dance diva with 12 of her  greatest and latest videos including &quot;Oye&quot; &quot;Heavens what I  feel&quot; &quot;Don't Stop&quot; &quot;Turn the beat around&quot;  &quot;You'll be Mine (Party time)&quot; &quot;I'm not giving you up&quot;  &quot;Higher&quot; &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; all ranging from the years  94 - 98, 5 of these videos are taken from her already multi platinum  release &quot;gloria!&quot;. It also takes us behind the scenes of her  recent promotional tour of the album with a look at rehearsals for such  shows as VH1 diva's live and The world music awards. The DVD has also been  nominated for a Grammy for best long form music video at this years (2000)  ceremony. A must have and worthy addition to your DVD collection."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As many others have mentioned, this video is a behind the scenes look at the \"Yield\" album recording sessions.Each member shares something different, whether talking about the band's approach to the album or how the band has changed over the years, or their personal views on the band or music in general.  The performance sections sound great, and nearly every song on the album is performed (at least in part).Yield is my favorite album so seeing the creative process behind it is very cool.  Input from each member is represented fairly equally, and you can see a kind of \"rebirth\" happening during the making of that album.Before \"Pearl Jam Twenty\" was released, this was really the only footage of its kind showing the creative process within the band, but for me this video has a uniquely intimate feel, as if you were in the studio with them rather than just seeing footage of the band recording.  Definitely would recommend this for all Pearl Jam fans, especially if you love Yield!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I do not need to even get into details.  This DVD performance is so important to the Alice in Chains legacy.  Also, it is perhaps the most meanful MTV Unplugged release of them all.  Layne is at his tormented best, so deep in pain, you get chills just hearing him sing.  Oh so sad, but yet he makes it sound so sweet and beautiful.  Jerry is just equal to Layne, never adding too much nor taking much away.  Layne and Jerry I think are the last great dou to emerge from the whole 90's rock explosion.  Get this DVD, all you need to do is love music, not even be a fan of AIC's, just love music.  Put this DVD in your player, push play, then close your eyes.  Let me know how you feel afterwards."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The title of this review, of course, is to reference the messsage bassist Sean Kinney wrote to four patrons of their MTV Unplugged set, Metallica. That is one of the many highlights, humorous and saddening,that you will find on this DVD. Of course, as mentioned may times over, the obvious fact is the deterioration of Layne Staley. The man was clearly on his last legs; the power and conviction in his voice is all but gone, and what is left is essentially a mouse-like figure, trembling and quivering his own shame and sorrow. Perhaps, at least for this performance,is for the best; the changes underscore the gravity and moxy that this band once had. \"Would\", \"Down In A Hole\" \"Rooster\" and \"Killer Is Me\" are some of the better performances that are featured is this must-own DVD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been listening to these boys for years but honestly I had never seen them.  To see them doing many of their hits live was more of a thrill than I had imagined.  They are so talented and quite a charasmatic presense on stage.  Jerry and Layne harmonize together flawlessly.  The drums on &quot;No Excuses&quot; are perfect as well as the opening bass line for &quot;Would?&quot;It is sad in a sense to watch Layne because of his untimely death but his creative talents will live forever in this concert.Many times in the concert the band members talk to the audience and as I said before many of their best songs are played.This is a must for ANY Alice in Chains fan."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I had the pleasure of seeing AIC on tour with Van Hagar (Halen) in 1991. They blew Van Hagar's door's off! Their shear talent, energy and musicianship were totally inspiring. I went there to see Van Hagar and emerged a lifetime AIC fan. No one has ever better coupled together brooding rock melody with power-chord virtuosity than AIC. Sadly, no one now will. Layne was a one-of-a-kind vocalist, both inspired and tormented by his inner demons and probably, like Cobain before him, hopelessly destined for his ultimate fate. Jerry continues to play and record admirably, but a major piece of him obviously died that fateful day in 2002.It is disconcerting that there are currently so many AIC-derivative bands making a shameless living off of unconvincingly replicating AIC's sound. Inspiration is one thing; sheer plagerism is quite another. Good luck, Jerry; R.I.P. Layne."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a moving performance by a severely underrated band. I didn't really start to appreciate AIC until the last few years. This is a great bare bones performance of AIC playing their most important songs. This is a testament to the bands incredible power.The crowning point of this video for me was the performance of \"Down in a Hole\". This is a very intense song that seems to eulogize the life of Lane Staley.If you are like me you will find this video so enjoyable to watch that you will likely watch it often. This video will change the way you look at everything."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "We even don't have to discuss the picture or sound quality of this DVD at all. ( If you must know the quality of the picture is poor, after all it was filmed in the 1980s, but the sound quality is excellent)This is Maestro Karajan's only appearance on Wiener Philarmoniker's New Year's Concert so it's worth having it for any Classical music fans. The Maestro was in the twilight of his life so you should not expect an energetic Karajan on the stage,but the great conductor was fully devoted to the music of his native Austria. The Soprano version of the Waltz Sound of Spring was the highlight...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "January 1st, 2006Every New Year's Day when I view this superb DVD of the VPO and Karajan at their most musicianly ways, I am impressed by the ebb, flow, and hesitancy which is the way the music of the Strausses should be played.A conductor friend of mine who studied in Vienna and was conductor of an orchestra in Lvov said that Karajan and the VPO in this recording got it RIGHT!Especially entrancing is the music accompanying the horses from the Spanish Riding School and Karjan's darling, Kathleen Battle, doing a fine rendition of the Voices of Spring.The stage is sumptuously decked out in what seem to be all of the fresh flowers in Vienna and one gets the sense that this was a real event because the maestro died only two years later.I highly recommend this DVD and it will give YOUR New Year's Day something special to remember it by.Timothy Wingate  OTTAWA  CANADA"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The sound is perhaps marginally better than its CD equivalent, however, the DVD really doesn't take total advantage of the medium.  The views of the orchestra and conductor is very limiting.  Infact there are at most 6 vantage points of PARTS of the orchestra, conductor or choir.  One really never sees entire sections or for that matter the entire orchestra. The result is a feeling of &quot;claustrophobia&quot; and no sense of occasion.The tight shots are not sympathetic to the breadth and the grandeur of the music.  The DVD medium could have allowed switchable overviews of the whole choir and orchestra.Furthermore, the views are backlit to the point that the glare is annoying.As far as the performance is concerned, it is highly polished, but somewhat on the dull side."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Nice for a first try (this is a direct dub from a SONY video with no added production values) but obviously this DVD will be remastered at some point to provide true surround sound and a better ecomomic layout.DG is already ahead of the game in that department, they have just released a DVD set &quot;Anne-Sophie Mutter - Beethoven's Complete Violin Sonatas&quot; featuring some six hours of music on two DVD's - talk about value for money!For me it's only a matter of time before SONY Music will reissue the complete Beethoven cycle on a double DVD set with much better sound (we've gone through this with the compact disc format and why shouldn't we again with the DVD format)!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Overall the sound and image quality of this DVD is OK but I am still quite disappointed by this release particularly the 4th movement &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;.  This performance is definitely worse than  the one recorded by Karajan in 1970's and may be not as good as that recorded in 1960's.  The tenor and baritone here are extremely weak and it feels like that they are singing serenade instead, which makes Beethoven's 9th symphony lack of strength.  Karajan's 1970's version of this work is the best and I wonder why he did not try to find someone as good as Peter Schreier and Jose van Dam.  Anyway, this release is still worth collecting since it's the only one on DVD.  Not too many choices."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Finally I bought this Karajan's last Beethoven's symphony cycle on DVDs and it was really exciting to take a close look at the conductor and orchestra while they were playing.  The orchestra and chorus are just excellent - exactly what I expected since I have their 1970s performance on CDs.  However, I am still quite disappointed by the 4th movement of the 9th Symphony because of the girly voices of the tenor and baritone, although the soprano and alto are brilliant.  Each time when I was watching this one, I had to be away from TV and speakers to avoid listening to tenor and baritone singing.  Anyway, it's still worth buying since I cannot expect another DVD from Karajan.  My rating for this symphony cycle is 5 stars for Symphonies nos. 1 - 6 &amp; 8, 4 stars for the 7th and 3 stars for the 9th.  The sound quality of this DVD is not as good as on CD but it's not a problem when turning the speakers louder."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have reviewed 5 Beethoven DVDs. Yes the recording is old....but can't imagine why video is so poor. The real problem is we buy these great masterpieces to experience the orchestra and not the conductor. We don't buy operas to watch the conductor nearly full time. I would agree there is little cinematography going on here....which seems criminal with such an important piece. I am nervous to get any Karajan piano or violin concertos les they not focus on the performer. I have a solution in Beethoven's masterpiece. Get the recent Blu-ray Vienna performance with Thielmann conducting in glorious 1080p DTS high definition. You will always judge every classical DVD by this performance....especially the direction and cinematography and of course picture and sound quality."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "\"The Four Seasons\" is probably one of the most famous and widely played symphony in the world. This version is beautifully shot and the sound quality is superb. Mr. Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic are in excellent form. It's always a treat watching Mr. Karajan conduct and play the harpischord. Reminding us how great composers like Beethoven did both in their days. Anne-Sophie Mutter's playing is both heavenly and flawless...and I'm a cellist!  This performance is like a wonderful bottle of Cabernet - very solid. Just perfect for a relaxing evening at home. It's great to have this version on dvd as testament to the growth and talent of Ms. Mutter.  Mutter's 1999 collaboration of \"The Four Seasons\" with the Trondheim Soloists is more energetic & uptempo. Mutter plays with a little more abandon. Unfortunately, the 1999 rendition is cd only and not available on dvd yet."}

The audio quality is very good, but there is some  slight rumble at high listening levels. The video seems over driven and  camera angles can be irritating when they hit laser lights (a common  problem)Now for the thoughtless part. The concert's lighting seems done  by a bunch of confused 10 year olds that think hundreds of spinning and  glaring laser lights and massive ultra violet lights are way cool. Reality  is that it all just detracts from Charlotte's presence.Luckily,  Charlotte's young voice and personality do overcome the childish  lighting.On a one to five scale, this DVD is still a 10!"}

Anyway, she sings a lot of her hits here, and there is also some bonus videos on the VHS, Butterfly and Breakdown, which are worth the price of this video alone. However once again DVD gets more extras, with extra videos for the two I listed, and as well My All and The Roof. Anyway this is a nice collection of live performances, but Mariah we are waiting for one of your tours to be released on video!"}

He doesnt even know who they are and he loved it hahaha :)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I can agree with the other reviews: this video, which is titled to be an Elmo one, does NOT have much Elmo in it. This left my daughter asking for the furry red monster throughout the video. Elmo makes cameo appearances, popping in here and there for a minute or two. The rest of the video is full of fun songs (we love the Mighty Mighty Bosstones one) but not enough character interaction. A little disappointing, but older kids and adults will really appreciate the songs and guest appearances."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have to disagree with the reviewer who says this video isn't good for little kids.  My daughter LOVES this video and has since she got it for her first birthday.  She wants to watch it over and over.  Her 4 year old cousin wants to watch it whenever he comes to visit.It's fun enough that you don't mind watching it over and over again.  John Stewart and David Alan Grier are hilarious and the music is great.  The only part that I don't particularly care for is Rosie O'Donnell, but that's just because I don't like her.Buy it for your kids.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "In 1994 Tony Bennett reestablished himself as an icon for the MTV generation. He appeared on the network's Unplugged in support of his new albums Perfectly Frank and Steppin' Out. In so doing he endeared himself to a new generation of fans and received critical attention the likes of which is usually reserved for new rock stars.This disc is a record of the show. Bennett accompanied by the Ralph Sharon Trio perform twenty-one classics from the great American songbook all done in Bennett's cool sinature style. Highlights include a truly unplugged Fly Me To the Moon, It Had to Be You, Rags to Riches, and the signature I Left My Heart in San Francisco. The disc includes duets with Elvis Costello and k.d.

The isle of Wight was more for the money than Woodstock. Some were kept out even if only one outta then of the crowd payed. We don't get the feeling that we're there with them as in Woodstock and the footage isn't as good but it is enjoyable, you can see some great performance, especially from Pete Townshend.

It's always a pleasure to listen to his music.  This Wildlife concert was to highlight his music and his love and interest in the environment.  Between every few songs John stops singing and talks about his inspiration for why he wrote a particular song.  I didn't find it distracting since many of John songs he wrote himself.

To me, he was a true genius at song writing. And, bless his heart, you could understand every word he said. Not like the noise they call music now where you have no idea what they are saying.  He was a national treasure and died too young. I am so glad that I was able to see him in concert in Fort Worth,Texas many years ago, probably in the mid 80s. It was wonderful. Of course he had lived here at one time and made jokes about meeting old high school friends again.  My other favorite is \"A Song's Best Friend\" which I've seen on PBS and now own a copy of."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "Over the years, I have purchased most of John Denver's LPs and then CDs, and also observed several of his performances on television. (Regrettably, I was never in the audience at one of his concerts.) Recently I saw the PBS program during which the program on this DVD was recorded over a two-day period. Denver has never sounded better nor seemed happier than he does during The WILDLife Concert, totally comfortable playing a rich and diverse selection of older and newer songs. How rare and commendable that he makes each of the 25 seem so fresh. He is joined by immensely talented associates, notably James Burton, Jim Horn, and Pete Huttinger. FYI, this DVD and its companion two-disc CD include the previously unreleased \"For You\" which is not available elsewhere.

{"label": 6, "raw": "Sometimes I wonder what goes through the mind of Marilyn Manson. What powers from the depths of hell created this band?! I swear I have never seen a nastier artist than Marilyn Manson. Not even Slayer was as nasty as  this guy. Believe me, one look at the video &quot;Sweet Dreams(are made of  this)&quot; scared the living hell out of me. I'd rather be watching videos  from the Aphex Twin master &quot;Richard D. James&quot;. If you plan to  watch this video.......well, don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Okay, my third try, here's the censored version:  This was a terrible idea.  I didn't realize what i was buying so i guess i'm an idiot for wasting my money.  Placing Type O Negative over the soundtrack to a 1930's black and white silent film is like trying to watch \"Dawn of the Dead\" overdubbed with \"The Monster Mash\".  Utterly awful. These bogus made-up \"Goths\" have spoiled the vampire mystique for everyone. Even if i liked this sorry-ass band (which i don't),i'd still think this was a horrible, LAME idea."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The music of Type O Negative did some justice to this film by enhancing it with a new flair of romanticism. Listening to David Carradine's introduction is odd, adding more darkness to the film. Carradine looks somewhat cyanotic perhaps bitten by Dracula himself, make one wonder if that's why he nervously plays with that cane. The opening tune Der Untermensch is awesome and sends shivers down your spine and then begins the completely hypnotic trance throughout the film. The other songs like Love You To Death, Die With Me, Prelude To Agony, Bloody Kisses, and Unsuccessfully Coping With The Natural Beauty Of Infidelity just to mention a few put the icing (or blood) on the cake on F.W. Murnau's Symphony Of Horror. I found this DVD to be an eclectic harmonizing mixture of the old and the new. A must buy for all TON people."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am normally not a big fan of Putamayo collections, but this one is excellent in my opinion.  Every song is soothing & melodic without being weird or cloying.  Although devised to help children fall asleep, I am an adult and I purchased it for myself for those nights I have difficulty turning off the noise in my mind and falling asleep.  I would not restrict this to bedtime however.  It is enjoyable enough to listen to anytime one needs to de-stress.  I feel my money was well-spent on this and I would not hesitate to purchase this as a new-baby-gift or for any child's birthday.  I don't like all lullaby-type albums, but this one is a winner.  Another excellent one is a collection by Windham Hill called \" On a Starry Night \".  I have played both of these to rock babies to sleep and also just to have lovely, soothing music to relax with.  I highly recommend this c d."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this CD for my baby daughter to try and help her fall asleep and it works wonderfully, she loves it!  The music is from all over the globe so there is a diverse range of sounds, but it is all pleasant.  I have listened to the CD over and over again and still I am not sick of it.  I also like the liner notes.  These songs are about such interesting things.  For instance one talks about children being afraid of foxes coming and another talks about how both the baby and the cat have golden cradles, but that the baby's is nicer.  I really recomend this CD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Conductor and composer John Rutter has been a fan of this work for a long time - and it shows.  The orchestra is simply excellent as are the Cambridge Singers.  Rutter chose to use two younger voices for the women's solo parts; the soprano was 29, the alto 25 when recorded.  The quality of voices changes over time and there are some solos that benefit from young voices and some that require mature voices - per the conductor's and listener's choices.  The tenor at times overdid the vibrato.  The solo voices were all excellent but sometimes they lacked the depth and power that more mature voices often offer.  Comments aside, this is a fine group of soloists.  The clarity and separation of the choral parts are excellent.  This is a medium-paced rendition which captures the emotions of the oratorio while not forgetting its baroque heritage.  This is one of my 9 recordings of the complete work and one you'll enjoy owning."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Having never heard the entire Messiah, I guess I was just lucky be introduced to it through this recording.  The solos are so clear and resonant, the choral numbers breathtaking and the orchestral support first rate.  We're all familiar with the famous Hallelujah chorus and I'd heard various other excerpts, but didn't realize there was so much more to the work or that it portrayed the story of Christ's entire life.My son had heard a piece on NPR about how Handel wrote this entire thing in 22 days and that it wasn't all that well received until the King of England heard it and was so overtaken, he stood and wept during the Hallelujah chorus.  My son hunted down a recording and was himself so moved, he put it on his iPod and gave me the CDs.  There are plenty of other versions out there, but after checking around, I realize we really lucked out with this one.  It is outstanding and highly recommended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "An incredible effort of the utmost grace.  Each piece is thoroughly thought out and the timing is simply impeccable.  The soprano's voice touches on the divine - it is not at all melodramatic but simple soaring gorgeousness.  My one mild complaint would be that I find the alto's voice much less beautiful - and her diction is heavy (e.g., \"get thee up to the high mountain\" becomes \"... mounthain\").  Aside from that, this is simply stunning.  The rendition of \"I Know That My Redeemer Liveth\" is absolutely shattering in its austere beauty. Wow!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is getting a little gimmicky - 3D glasses and images on the cover, 'Superband' status with all these big names - and nowhere near as powerful a return from the first album. It's an okay rock album, but something I cannot sit down and directly plug my ears and brain into. I have to have it as background noise while I am working. Don't get lost in the marketing gimmick of 'Hagar and Satriani', but still worth a shot if you have not heard the first Chickenfoot album. If you have heard the first album, don't get your hopes too high."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Joe Satriani is capable of much more.  I think this album along with the first one proves that Joe just can't write actual rock songs (outside of his solo stuff) that are more than just mediocre.  Everything is just so bland and average.  I wish he would go back to doing Surfing with the Alien type music.  He was so great and inspired back then.  Anyway, I know people here don't like the comparison, but the new Van Halen Album \"A Different Kind of Truth\" absolutely destroys this waste of time.  I hope CF changes things a lot for their next album.  I will keep buying them, but I'm starting to lose faith that they will come out with anything decent in their current form.  I do think, however, the drummer is really good, and that shows on this album."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I notice there seems to still be this competition with some VH fans that won't die and never will so I thought I would put my two cents worth in here.I love the new Van Halen record ADKOT but that does not mean I am suppose to dislike this record like some people have decided, they are both great! I do favor the new VH more but that's not to say this is not an excellent record IT IS! I was and still am a fan of VH with DLR and Hagar and now Chickenfoot as well it's nice to have this much good RnR these days we should all feel blessed we do! By the way for young ones still learning Sammys music check out his fantastic solo record Standing Hampton."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is one of the best hard rock CDs I've heard in a very long time.Far better than the first disc.There is a version with a CD/DVD package, but I bought the CD only and found a serious rocker bonus track, not listed on the liner and from what I hear, NOT included if you buy the CD/DVD package.The band is very diverse on this with rockers, cranking hard rockers and some lighter rockers and ballads. Hagar is at the top of his game. Everyone is and standing out individually while creating an open quality band statement on each track.Three and half letters is a very powerful (words and music) rockin' piece.No Change, the unlisted bonus track just absolutely rocks full tilt.I've only heard the whole disc twice, but in will be my driving disc for a long time. I hope the radio catches on to this."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This album is a big improvement over the first Chickenfoot disc. The playing is tighter and seems more inspired. Sammy is singing great and the annoying, recycled cliches that were passing for lyrics on the last CD are less obvious. This band has such potential to make some really memorable music. It is just a shame that they won't call in some old friends to give them some songwriting help. Sammy is the only one in the band that has ever written a lyric and although this is the best stuff he has written in the last decade, that isn't saying that much. I hope that they can pull off releasing another. The 3 best tunes on this disc are: Up Next, Come Closer and Big Foot."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Liked Sammy's work with Van Halen and selectively his solo stuff. Love most everything Satriani has put out. Feel indifferent about the other two band members. Liked 3-4 tracks off the first Chickenfoot album to keep me interested and they still make it into my workout set list every once in a while.... My kid gloves off review of this album is not too kind. I don't hear growth so much as regression. The best two tracks on the album are Different Devil and Up Next, everything else is throw away. Different Devil is good but it sounds like something off a Hagar solo record, Up Next is the only song that reminds me the guitarist behind this album is one of the best alive. Only problem with Up Next is that I really don't want to hear Hagar's vocals on this one because the lyrics just disappoint compared to that great guitar work.Oh well, maybe the next one will be better."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Saw \"the Foot\" early last November, about a month after III was released. The concert was at Webster Hall in the East Village, NYC. There are no seats, so everyone stands from the git go. I was ten feet from the stage in the center, packed in tight with several hundred new friends.I was expecting Hager-fueled good time hard rock with Sensei Satriani showing all how its done. But I hadn't bought III yet, so this was my first time hearing the tunes. So, I wasn't expecting Three and a Half Letters. If you haven't already, check out the sample for a taste.Long story short, it brought me right back to my youth in the Sixties and the MC5, founders of punk rock and their classic tune, \"Up Against the Wall Mother&lt;EXPLETIVE DELETED>\" Three and a Half Letters is a anthem for today's broken world.Right On, and Rock On Chickenfoot!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This cd rocks! But I knew this was going to happen.On a side note, be sure to watch the song inspiration on the web which explains their process behind every song. It really provides insight on the album. There isn't a bad song here. Something Gone Wrong is my favorite. It is an acoustic, 12 string piece, good lyrics, and a classic Joe guitar bridge. With overall tempo which I prefer. I do like the lyrical message on Three and Half Letters, (I Need a Job). I can't wait until Chickenfoot 2!  Or Chickenfoot 6!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Don't be fooled, this is a great album, has a rythm and blues feel to it, the lyrics are cool. You can feel these guys had fun writing this album. Completely disagree with the 1 Star ratings or for that matter anything less than 3 stars, some people have anger issues. The music is great, definitely better than some of the older Sammy albums. It's a bit different, laid back, it's all Sammy Hagar material here, nothing surprising, and in no way are these guys selling on their big names alone... can't wait to see them again in concert."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "chickenfoot 111 takes off where it last was with the first cd. I read that joe challenged sammy to sing like he never did before but I dont hear any change in his vocals not bad just no difference in his style and sammy did the same with joe to play things unexplored and i dont hear anything different but joe still is badd real badd plays his ass off so he's just fine. Chad and Mike are just fine as well but I don't like the lyrics(who writes them?) on some of the songs but overall great collection of songs.  I like song 11(they lied about this one they lied about that one)nice tune, bye yall"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Everyone is comparing this one to the first. Why bother, if you like these guys chances are you will like everything they put out, I know I do. After all, you have four longtime hard driving rockers that have been doing it for years. Sammy sounds as good as ever and Joe is one of the all time greats. The highlight of the disc for me is Something Gone Wrong, what a great song! Joe pours his soul out with his guitar playing in this song. Mikes backup vocals are tremendous here. A good mix of rockers and ballads on this disc. When you mix this album with the other it will make one great concert. It should be a great tour. I am just glad these guys are still making new music after all these years. Great Cd!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Not only is this a great second album by a true \"supergroup\" but the packaging of the vinyl edition is awesome. I have not seen the disc version but the 3-D effect of the vinyl edition is some of the best I have seen and the booklet,Gatefold and sleeves all are cool as helll. If you like the first album I recommend this as it may be a little more mature but still plenty of excellent guitar work from Satch. I saw them live in 2009 and am glad they stuck together because they were jaw dropping and this album does not disappoint."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I loved the first Chickenfoot CD.  Loved it a lot. Great CD.  This one is better.  Much better!  The song structure and lyrical composition are both superior.  These are the best, most well constructed lyrics Hagar has even written.  The backing vocals are simply wonderful (VH has got to me missing Mikey).  The rhythem section is way more then solid.  This is simply wonderful, powerful, hard driving rock and roll.  If your fan of rock, there is not a bad song in this collection, front to back, every song is great!  Maybe the worst song is the \"single\" Bigfoot (so if you liked that, you'll LOVE the rest of the CD.  The hidden track \"untitled\" is maybe one of the best among the songs in this collection.  Buy it...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I agree with quite a few others that almost all the songs here are generic sounding Sammy Hagar songs (maybe something solo).  Not even the great guitar player can save these songs.  The only song I like is the last one, Something Gone Wrong!  And that describes the rest of this CD for me.  I was really surprised by the first Chickenfoot CD, the songs were really catchy GREAT HOOKS that had you stompin your foot!  And I'm not even the biggest Hagar fan, I did like Montrose and selective Van Hagar!  But that first CD really nailed it and it was a surprise hit going GOLD!  I just dont see the same thing happening here, I dont think it's going to catch on like the first one!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Miles and Slash are a perfect match and the songwriting is at a very high level on this release. I didn't care for Slash's prior CD with the various vocalists, but this one was a pleasant surprise. This is hard rock done right with lots of energy, soaring vocals and killer riffs. The choruses and hooks get stuck in your head and you want to listen to it over and over. There is not a bad track on here...and the extra tracks on the deluxe version are great too.If you like other great current rock bands like Sixx A.M., Hardcore Superstar and Voices of Extreme...then you will like this. If you liked Guns N Roses...then you SHOULD like this unless you are hung up on Axl being gone....but Miles sounds great, your loss."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Ghost of Guns N' Roses lives in this album if you listen carefully, in some cases Myles \" The Dying Cat\" tries to emulate Axl's style.Take a good listen and you'll find \"Locomotive\" riff from Use Your Illusion in \"Standing in the Sun\", \"Anything Goes\" from Appetite in \"Halo\" the chorus has some of Axl's style from \"Outta Get Me\", \"Move to The City\" is in \"Hard & Fast\" and the Chorus is very similar to \"Been There Lately\" From Slash's SnakepitGood album but sorry I cannot stand the annoying whining nasal singing from Myles..."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was never a huge fan of Slash (or GnR for that matter - pretty good, but not great). I always thought Slash was overrated and more of an image thing. I've heard him outside of GnR on a few one-off projects (Hendrix tribute and Muddy Waters tribute), and the solos sounded the same and stale.But I heard \"Standing In The Sun\" on the radio, and I liked it enough to try this CD. Holy crap is it good. \"Standing In The Sun\" is the weakest cut on the CD.I'm also a Myles Kennedy fan. His vocals are perfectly suited for this heavy rock, but unlike Alter Bridge, these songs are not all power ballads. Now, I like power ballads and Alter Bridge, but they get old. Same formula, etc. But these songs are just straight-forward heavy rock. Powerful, riff-heavy, and show-off chops. Each different and great. I am officially a Slash fan now."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "What I'd like to know is what the guys in the band were saying to each other when they were going over the final mix-down. It couldn't have been \"Check out that guitar solo!\" or \"This song is incredible!\" or \"Guys, we really outdid ourselves this time! Great work, everybody!\"This was simply one of the worst compilations of \"rock\" music I have ever heard. The riffs are boring! The lyrics are boring! The music is boring! This album is garbage. There isn't one single memorable hook or lyric on it. It was a total and complete waste of money!They should have named the album \"Apocalyptic Sleeping Pill.\"Clank! Clank! Clank! (That was the sound of the CD smacking the sides of the trash can)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "\"Apocalyptic Love\" is great! This is an great follow-up from Slash. A terrific rock album. All (13) tracks on here are great.Track Listing1. Apocalyptic Love (4 out of 4)2.

{"label": 6, "raw": "Slash makes his solo return with his second album Apocalyptic Love. After listening to it a couple of times, i think that it is a nice upgrade from his solo debut. Apocalyptic Love has a more connected feel about it that better showcases Slash`s trademark no-fills rock along with fine support from Miles Kennedy and the Conspirators. Listening to the album, it is very obvious how well they have gelled together after a lot of touring in the last year.Overall i highly recommend Apocalyptic Love to anyone that loves no-fills, balls to the wall rock."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "this is undeniably a fantastic record... i can't wait to see it live, but it sounds pretty bad. i am so frustrated by the record industry's penchant for overcompressing music these days! in my car, which has a pretty decent stock stereo, all the parts that are 'thick' sounding are clipping badly, as if i'm listening to the record while a helicopter flies by outside. there's a thrumming low frequency clipping that is annoying. the parts that are supposed to be airy and chimey sound like they're coming out of a can! i turned down the bass a little past the center detent, and turned the treble up a LOT to compensate... this ticks me off! why should i continue to BUY albums if record companies keep squashing the life out of music like this?! three stars for the crappy sound quality, 10 stars for the music itself..."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I had pretty much given up on Rush ever since their Grace Under Pressure album. Though there were a few songs I considered decent (Big Money and One Little Victory for example) the rest all seemed like filler music to me. But then Snakes & Arrows came out and I said to myself with much reserved, \"hey, maybe they have found inspiration again\". It was a pretty good album IMO. But with the arrival of Clockwork Angels I'm fully convinced that this band is serious about putting out the great music we all know these guys create. Snakes & Arrows was no fluke!Warning: This work is not for folks who need light Sunday listening music, Nickelback\\Foo Fighters generic rock or bubblegum pop. It's like sitting down to a steak dinner and a heavy dark porter. When you're done listening you'll know you've had one hell of a feast.I give this album a 4 out of 5 only because nobody believes 5 out of 5 reviews even though this is a 5 out of 5 album."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The newest release from that trio up north is probably their best since \"Snakes and Arrows\". And yes, I know, \"Snakes and Arrows\" was their last studio release. My point is everything they make is great. Rush has such a unique sound that also appeals to a broad range of fans. I have been a fan since their release of 2112 and I have every album they have made except for a couple of their live releases. If you don't have this one yet, Rush out and get it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I won't breakdown and analyze each individual track but this album as a whole absolutely rocks! If you are a Rush \"fan\" and don't immediately love it, you should keep playing it - because Rush's musical brilliance is there if you are open-minded enough to really listen for it. If you are reading the reviews due to an indecision to buy Clockwork Angels...don't waste another day and just do it.I believe that most people that download and buy only single tracks are cheating themselves because you must listen to Clockwork Angels from start to finish. This is a concept style album which Rush fans have come to enjoy and this is no exception, so I strongly recommend having enough time to listen to Clockwork Angels in it's entirety. While most significant rock music artists of the last 40 years are \"nursing\" their careers with greatest hits tours and uninspiring new music, Rush hasn't lost their fire or creativity."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have always liked Rush since I found out about them in 1978 with the release of Hemispheres. A buddy was already listening to them known through his older brother. His brother took us to school one morning and was jamming to hemispheres. I was hooked. Bought the album asap and began buying their other albums as well. Their music has a much different feel for me now days and it seems although the album is still good, it lacks something that the members of Rush had in the earlier days. Not disappointed in the album, it is more or less my taste of music has changed as well because I have not heard a big winner from the last several albums from Rush. I may like a song or two but that will be it. In the past, I usually liked the entire album with maybe one or two songs that I did not like."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been a Rush fan forever. I have loved most of the stuff they have put out but always have found a few tracks to be duds on every recent release. Clockwork Angels has no duds. It is absolutely amazing beginning to end. It is the first RUSH album since Signals that I want to hear all of Live. I love everything thing about this album. I even like the muddy mix, flashy wiz kid studio production and the cover art. This is the album I have been waiting for! Thank you Neil, Alex and Geddy for making this fan a freaking happy one!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It's Rush, it's brilliant. No more needs to be said-Except for one thing-For some reason, my copy is in a jewel case and not the digipak that every other copy of this album I've seen has been packaged in. You say, &#34;So what?&#34; Well, to a geek like me, that makes it some kind of &#34;One of a kind&#34; thingy. Is it a bootleg? I don't believe so-So, nanapoopoo stick your head in doodoo, mine is in a jewel case."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Disclosure: I'm one of those Rush fans that has enjoyed all of their albums, even the lighter, almost jazz-like offerings. I've enjoyed dropping the needle on each new album wondering what it would sound like.That said, most of us long-time Rush fans became fans around (if not exactly) \"2112.\" Those earlier albums defined the \"Rush sound\" that polarized music fans. For those of us who loved it, we fell hard. We ate up \"Farwell to Kings\", \"Permanent Waves\", \"2112\", and even \"Caress of Steel\" (which polarizes even Rush fans).\"Clockwork Angel\" is a return to those earlier albums. This album flat out rocks! If fact, most of these tracks would not be out of place in the Thrash Metal category. For me, it belongs square in the classic \"Rush Sound\" Prog-Rock category.Grade: A"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "They've really outdone themselves on this album. They're playing harder than they've ever played and the arrangements are outstanding. Neil is absolutely destroying his drums.I personally want to thank producer Nick Raskulinecz for working with these guys and pushing them to play to their full potential....the results speak for themselves.BTW, I loved BU2B but the album version is even better than the original. The title track is mind blowing and it amazes me how these guys can keep progressing and coming up with such great music."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was so happy Rush finally came out with another studio release and for good reason. I think this is the best Rush album ever released. I've always loved these guys and went back and listened to some of the earlier stuff just to make sure and for me this is the best. The musicianship is flawless, the songs are very well layered but yet it has a raw sound about it that can't be beat. This is one of those albums that you can listen to over and over and it always gets better. Rush has just dethroned Dream Theater as my favorite band again... lol"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "There's not much to say here other than it's a solid Rush album. I did not start listening to Rush until late 80s/early 90s, so I never was exactly in love with their 70s stuff (though I later learned to like it).  The musicianship is great, as always.  Seeing them on tour a few years ago was one of the best musical experiences of my life.  I would definitely recommend that if you like their stuff, go see them live and damn the price of the ticket.  It will be worth it,  believe me."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "This album absolutely blows away Snakes and Arrows. Not only do you have a jamming Rush but the melodic as well!! The song Headlong Fight is definitly the best song on the album. Probably one of the best songs that they put out in a while. The melodic side is back. The songs Halo Effect, The Wreckers and The Garden have an atmospheric sound that will send chills through you as you listen. There is not a bad song on the album, compared to finding a good song that will stick to you on Snakes and Arrows. They have come along way with their music. and hopefully they will make more! This CD gives me faith in the bands new music form again. I hope it continues. You can only Wish Them Well! See you at the show in Philly!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "No, really. Signals was about technology throughout and this one is about life's journeys. Signals has always been my favorite album by cohesiveness alone but this one is now second. I loved Vapor Trails for the first few years of it but I finally agreed that it had sound issues. Snakes and Arrows, I tried to like it and thought I really did but now, Clockwork Angels has surpassed both by miles. The sound is back and the songwriting and the essence of Rush is back. Everything a Rush album should be, this one takes the cake. They even surprised everybody with several great ballads. Honestly, the only ones I skip(not because they are not good songs but because of the sound)are Caravan and BU2B. Too harsh sounding, IMO. They corrected that with the balanced sound of \"Clockwork angels\" the song. And the rest of the songs flow perfectly after that.Rush has done it right this time, again."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When I first heard the first two singles from this album before it came out I was psyched Rush was doing an album this heavy but when I bought the album it leaves a lot to be desired. it starts off with a band with Caravan, BU2B, and Clockwork Angels but after that it took a confusing left turn for me. Some of Geddy's vocals are a little too shreaky and turns me off from the songs and some of their string arrangments on this album dosen't help either. I have to say i like 7 out of the 12 songs on here. I recommend their earlier records though."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The band was in shambles after Test for Echo, due to Neil's losses. Their follow-up, Vapor Trails, showed a band struggling to remain a band. Vapor Trails was a tremendous letdown for a lot of fans, myself included, not to mention holding the award for probably one of the worst sounding albums ever released by a major label, but it contains a lot of passion. Snakes and Arrows has some great moments and a few decent tracks overall, but it falls flat as whole. With Clockwork Angels we see Rush back in full swing. They want it again and they're pushing themselves to be as good as they know they can: Solid playing at a very high level, complex and intricate arrangements that keep your attention, and a passion that shows they really want to make something great!We thank you! Can't wait to see it live!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I really like this album! The band is very tight. Lots of change ups & tempo changes & some of the heaviest playing i have ever heard rush do. Yes it's a concept album but you can pick any song and just play it. musially i think it is the best album they have ever made. lyrically 2nd best. Under 2112 i would say this is there 2nd best album ever. They are just playing there guts out on this album.It's like there playing while the room is on fire around them. Because of the concept aspect of the album only lyrically it reminds me of 2112. Musically it reminds me of the albums counter parts or snakes & arrows on steroids. Geddy's voice sounds killer on this record & this album show's some of the best music Alex & Neil have ever done together. If you have ever liked just one song rush has done you will like this album."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "My favorite Rush album is Caress of Steel and what that album has that this one lacks is a crisp, crackling bite to the guitar and a clear depth to the drums and bass. Rush seems to have forgotten the importance of negative space, i.e., intervals between the sounds that give these sounds their definition and, I would argue, their power. The songs on the digitally recorded and over-processed Clockwork Angels are buried in a wall of noise and they must fight to be heard like poltergeists trapped in a snowy television set.As you might guess, I don't listen to a whole lot of modern music and have a bias against albums that are mastered with the amount of dynamic compression that is today's industry standard. This bias isn't just an aesthetic preference. I find that dynamically compressed music tires my ears after about ten minutes. Clockwork Angels may well be a significant sonic improvement over recent recordings like Vapor Trails (I wouldn't know) but it's still not enough to make me want to listen to it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like most new Rush CDs, I had to listen to this several times before I could form an opinion.  This is a good Rush disc.  The music sounds great & there are many good songs.  Geddy's voice sounds more mature.  However, his vocals sound tired; that is the only way I can describe them.  While I am always happy to get new Rush material, I can't really point to a specific song/highlight on the disc.  There is just something about this disc that disappoints.  I can't put my finger on it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This band has hung around for 40 years, made some great albums in the early 1980's, continued from there with repetitive material but great concerts, and now suddenly they are better, massively better.  Not only does Clockwork Angels succinctly present a lifetime of life's lessons in precise lyrics, but these guys really really rock.  Rather than discuss each track, which are all incongruent with Top 40 tunes, I'll just say it's their most cohesive album ever.  No other band out today can but hide and listen in the force of this material.  The last track, Garden, is beyond thorough composition - it can only be compared to the great allegories of literature and classical music.  A few great rock bands have survived, but Rush is the only one I know that still thrives."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The title description speaks for itself.I won't bore you with a song by song review because all the songs are amazing from the beginning to end...Classic sound with a modern twist.Rush is that one band that will never disappoint.They remain one of my fave bands ever,if not favorite and I'm sure they will still put out albums after this release.If you're a Rush fan pretty much from the beginning,this is for you.You won't take the disc out of your player.Yes,I still buy cd's and will until they are not made anymore  Rock n roll!!!!  \\m/"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I totally respect RUSH, and love some of their stuff like HEMISPHERES, FAREWELL TO KINGS, 2112 and FLIGHT BY NIGHT...but, it's been a long time since the last great RUSH album, that maybe is COUNTERPARTS(1993)....Since TEST OR ECHO, i think RUSH is not so inspired anymore, especially Neil Peart's lyrics....they are REALLY dark now....as musicians, Neil, Geddy and Alex are monsters!!!! Can't remenber many bands as techinical as RUSH...but the songs are not inspired...in fact, since SIGNALS(1982), RUSH started to create music with a kind of POP heaviness...i will stick with their legendary classic stuff like CARESS OF STEEL, PERMANENT WAVES and MOVING PICTURES!!!!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I Honestly wonder what these 1 star reviewers are smoking?This is by far the best rush album in over 20 years!(My first Rush album was Presto,Which had just come out at the time,A Highly underrated and masterful album,IMHO.)From the opening track\"Caravan\" To the stunningly beautiful\"The garden\",This the RUSH That  I have missed!! The songwriting is fantastic,And hearing geddy playing his old-school rolling basslines again put a smile on my face.Being a bass player myself,I Felt that Geddy was underutilizing his talent on the last 5 albums or so.Is it just me,Or do I hear Shades of \"Signals\" In this album?Hopefully,This isn't Rush's last album,But if it is,They're going out on top.A Much better album than it has any right being from a band 40 years and 20 albums into their career.They lost their fire for a while,But thankfully,They've found it again,And they're back,Amazingly,Better than ever.Long live RUSH!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "there last one snakes and arrows & this album was to me are 2 pf there best album since presto.id say i love probably 10 of the 12 songs.at least 5 could be played live with there classic hits!gettys voice isnt what it use to be but his voice is mature and sounds great.great riffs,drums,bass and solid song writing.and to me i will be listening to it for years to come and proud to put next to prestoand it sounds like most people who dont like the album is because of the compression which i dont blame them.you shouldnt need an audiophile system to have it sound good!luckly my tube amp gives it that added analog sound.BUT if your judging the album quality by mp3s you must be shot in the HEAD!at once!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Today is 10/12/2012 friday and I listened to Clockwork Angels yesterday and already I picked out my favorite tunes.  Snakes and Arrows is where I left off and this is just magic music.  When you grow up with a band what can I say???? even cd's you don't like that much it's still your band.  Caravan BU2B Halo Effect 7 Cities of Gold Headlong Flight Wish Them Well The Garden (the rest too but you get the point) I'm glad everyon's still alive to make music and I'll enjoy them till I'm dead(which I hope aint no time soon)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I first saw Brian Regan on Comedy Central talking about simple things like IHOP and trifocals...absolutely hilarious. This is a very funny disk...especially the name and spelling bee bits. I really like this guy because he doesn't curse and he isn't dirty at all. Comedians these days think they have to be vulgar to be funny. In my opinion, vulgarity isn't funny at all; Profanity in comedy has been rubbed into the ground. It's annoying and a sign of a lack of creativity. Brian Regan is clean, ingenious and hilarious."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Can it get any better than this?  \"I submit that it CANNOT!\"  This guy is so hilarious.  My husband and I got this CD after cracking up at his stand up on Comedy Central.  Brian Regan is one of those comedians you love to see in clubs.  You leave reciting some of his stuff and begin to laugh with yourself just thinking about it.  Everything is clean and nonoffensive as someone else said, but to be honest, I didn't really think about that until reading their review.  But it's true, very much like Bill Cosby Himself.  Love it!  The only downside is with it being a CD, you can't see his facial expressions, which if you have seen him on TV, you know what I mean :)  I wish there was more of his stuff available."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Brian Regan, IMO is extremely under-rated! It seems just about anyone I ask if they've ever heard of Brian Regan, their response is: \"who\"??? well, I wish more people knew of him because he is just \"laugh-out-loud\" funny! Excellent CD, by the way... I saw him Live recently and he did a lot of jokes from this CD... buy it! it's hilarious! and one more addition, he's a \"clean\" comic, so your kids can listen to this CD too!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Well, I know I'm a little late to this CD (12 years) but I looked it up on Amazon after hearing the first selection on Laugh USA Sirius XM last week.  I listen to that station for some smiles and giggles when I'm driving.  Brian Regan came on talking about \"you too\" and \"take luck\" and I almost had to pull over to the side of the road.  I was laughing so hard it really was dangerous!So now I have the CD and I listen at home where it's much safer for everyone.  It's just hilarious, no two ways about it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Every time I see his performance on Comedy Central I laugh. 5 times maybe and I am still laughing hysterically. His humor is witty, yet he doesn't always pick out things like current events. I love his pop-tart bit. The things that make him the best are his facial expressions, eye movements, and the tone of his voice. It's masterful, and it's too bad that this CD doesn't show him doing all of that. His dvd is coming out soon though, so cross your fingers for that.This cd doesn't have the poptart though...Still, it has alot. All his talk about animals is funny. Especially spider webs. The car stuff is funny too. \"Blasting Zone Ahead\" and \"Seatbelts\" are 2 of my favorites."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Brian Regan is an amazingly funny man. Not only is his act clean enough for everyone, but his observations on life are truly on the money and exquisitely made. From ridiculous spill-and-spell names like \"Aymie\", to psychotic doughnut consumption habits, there is no area of American life safe from Regan.I am especially fond of \"Hooked on Phonics\", \"Kid's Party Games\", \"Donut Lady\", and \"Spider Webs and Bees\", although there is not a clunker on the entire CD. For truly funny comedy that the entire family can share, this CD is impossible to beat.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go find a doughnut with icing all over it, but sprinkles only on one side."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I first heard Brian on Sirius a few years ago, I thought; hey I'd like to hear more.  The guy is sooo funny!  Good grief I laughed so hard!  I have him on my iPod and let some other folks hear his comedy particularly Stupid in School & You too and stuff, his material had one person doing everything they could, to keep from howling on the bus!  I just downloaded his \"All by Myself\" I laughed for almost 40 minutes.  This guy is gifted, funny, imaginative, & clean/family oriented.  I had one person tell me that they wanted to get his material for listening on car trips with their child, because his being clean AND funny was something they could both enjoy.  The guy is awesome. If you like to laugh, you're going to love this. Can't wait for the next CD/download."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I listen the entire new album of Chris Rea. I never hear a Chris Rea album before. This is an excepcional, complex & mesmerize album. This is the best album of this new century & one of the best blues album of all time. Eleven albums in one year !!! This is incredible. You must listen to it to believe it. The latin blues by English man sounds superior to the latin blues make for sud americans & spanish people. All the albums are great & sounds very very diferent. My favorites are: 60's & 70's, Chicago Blues,Electric Memphis Blues, Latin Blues & Ballads Blues. I recomend very much."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I must admit to being a dedicated fan of Chris Rea for many years and had not heard anything from this group at all.  I came across the collection purely by chance and decided to give it a try.  It has three Cd's and two vinyl albums.  Have not heard the vinyl as yet but the first of the three cd's is instrumental and takes you back to an earlier time in rock where the feel of the beat and the sound was all important.  It is fantastic.  The next two cd's are a variety of rocky and bluesy tracks which are equally as good.  On top of that you have the bonus of being able to read this very good quality book.  A very good collection from quality muso's."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This three cd packet of music delivers just like all of Chris Rea's music. His last endeavor of 11 cds of music on the history of the blues is a must in any collection of the blues. If you have not discovered Chris', then buy this bundle of extremely enjoyable music. He includes three LPs in the packet as well. His writing, singing and total professionalism have always come through into his music. Buy this and any other work he has done. His voice is a credit to the blues as is his mastery of many instruments that he plays on many of his cds. The total performer. If you like Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton, then you will enjoy Chris Rea."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you wonder where Stevie Ray Vaughn got his outstanding guitar licks on  &quot;Texas Flood&quot;, listen to &quot;Blues Power&quot;.  They're all  there in this original by Albert King.  I saw B. B. King on TV a few times  around 1970, but on Sunday nights around 1971 there was a show on PBS of  rock concerts from the Filmore. One night Albert King was on there, a film  of part of this very performance!  That is what cinched it for me as a  blues fan.  I'd never heard guitar playing that touched so close to home.  Every phrase was dynomite.  I can't recomend this album enough."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The best meditation cd money can buy. Also indispensible mood music for writing, painting, blissing out, anything really except driving. My 11-year old son used to be disturbed by the quiet power of this music, now he loves reading to it. I often throw &quot;Doje Ling&quot; into the cd player when I've got a heavy day of deadlines before me. Works wonders. For those curious about meditation books, pick up, &quot;Meditation Made Easy&quot; by Lorin Roche. That and his and Camille Maurine's, &quot;Meditation Secrets for Women&quot; are the two absolute best books out there and complement &quot;Dorje Ling&quot; perfectly."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "After Yatra this is the next of Parsons' discs to own, in my opinion. I would say this is more for the seasoned electronic music listener. The disc starts off with the piece, Tantra. This contains Tibetan trumpets, large hand cymbals, and Tibetan monks throat singing. The track builds to an exciting conclusion.The tracks, Tsaparang, Lauhaul Valley, and Dorje Ling follow in a similar vein. These are deep excursions into meditative electronic music. K-2 is a lighter piece that ends the disc. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The heading is not a bold statement its the truth. While other rappers' mixtapes are all guns, drugs and which hoe did it with freddy kreuger last night, Dead Prez devotes mixtape time to give you insight and thought provoking rhymes. Standout Tracks: TURN OFF THE RADIO, THAT'S WAR, WE NEED A REVOLUTION, FOOD CLOTHES & SHELTER part 2, SOULJA LIFE MENTALITY(Soulja Slim RIP), GET UP, KNOW YOUR ENEMY, IT WAS WRITTEN, NO LOVE, THO IT UP, HIP HOP(RBG mix)etc. Filler: Sellin d.o.p.e.. Bottom Line: Dead prez's mixtapes are better than most rappers mixtapes and albums if you want to take it that far. On some songs they use other people's beats like the late Aaliyah's I need a resolution and Black Rob's Whoa but they put their on positive spin on these track so Im okay with it. Both mixtapes by Dead Prez are strongly recommended by me as well as their albums."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Enya's richly chorded style has smitten me once again.  A little bit Gregorian, a lot Celtic, combined with a soft, well crafted execution, gives us a CD anyone can enjoy and relax with.  Enya performs all the instruments and vocals on the album.  Her vocal style is willowy and sweet, which blends with the synthesizer and piano accompaniment perfectly.This is great &quot;Hot Tub&quot; or massage music.  If you're not so lucky as to have both a tub and a masseuse available, just try a recliner with a glass of wine.  Enya has given us more great music, still with her unique perspective of flow and rhythm.  Her music remains timeless and fresh years after its release."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Ok, first off, Enya rocks.  If you don't know that already, go buy her compilation album, Paint the Sky with Stars.  It will enlighten you.  If you already know how good she is and you aren't desperate to buy everything she's ever done, there is something wrong with you.All right, so maybe Enya isn't for everyone.  But you will likely appreciate her if you have ever been truly moved by a dreamy piece of music.  She is soft, soulfull, and dynamic.  And yeah, so her music all sounds the same, but when it's so good, how can you complain?Highlights from The Memory of Trees include &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot;, and &quot;On My Way Home&quot;."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons.' 'The Celts, Watermark and Day...' were all pleasant and admirable throughout, but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically. But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory...' reaches those heights and beyond. It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting. I'm actually glad that this song didn't get overexposed the way Only Time did. It makes it that much more special to all who own this album."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the third review of an irish album I write today (the others were Cranberries) and now I'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world. And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way. Okay, I just wanted to say something about Irish  music. Now let's say something about this album. It's great. it's  beautiful. Very good, easy listened music. If you like Enya or you just  want some easy-listened relaxing music. This is the album for you to buy!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This album is so hauntingly beautiful.  It reminds me of how the Celts and Druids would endow trees with human and other life characteristics.  Now...every time I prune a tree I expect it to say \"ouch!\", or when I walk by a tree I expect it to reach out to me.  Listening to this album, especially after consuming a quart or more of good Irish whiskey is a delight.  I remember trees and I am sure, after listening to this album, that they remember me also.  Definitely a buy!  Cuckoo ForCeltic"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Enya is such a wonderful artist, truly given a gift from God!! Every song on this album is a delight to listen to. \"Once You Had Gold\" is a song I'm actually using in a fanfiction story I'm writing, and I hardly ever do \"songfics.\" But this song is so beautiful and poignant and angsty that it fits perfectly with the message I'm trying to get across.Other special favorites are the title song, Anywhere Is, Athar Ar Neamh, China Roses . . . Okay, let's just say the whole album is a classic!!! I'm not really into new age music, but Enya is different! You will not go wrong buying her albums, and especially this one is a must-have!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Cuarto disco de Enya, y el cual demuestra cada vez m&aacute;s la intenci&oacute;n de  dirigirse a un p&uacute;blico m&aacute;s masivo (la canci&oacute;n \"anywhere is\" dif&iacute;cilmente la  habr&iacute;a relacionado con Enya de haberla escuchado sin saber que el disco es  de ella); sin embargo, en otras de sus melod&iacute;as ha depurado su estilo tan  particular, haciendo de este disco una compra obligada para cualquier  persona que admire la obra de esta artista. De hecho, podr&iacute;amos decir que  esta es una excelente elecci&oacute;n para adentrarse poco a poco al mundo sonoro  de Enya, ya que este disco resulta m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil de escuchar que sus  anteriores. Si lo que desea es tener un muestrario de lo mejor de esta  artista, probablemente le convenga m&aacute;s comprar el disco \"paint de sky with  stars\"; una recopilaci&oacute;n de lo mejor de sus cuatro discos."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I started my Enya collection with The Celts, and quickly added Shepherd Moons and Watermark, and I really liked those.A few years later I got The Memory of Trees, and I was disappointed.  Although there were some good pieces on this, it really wasn't as good as those first three.  It seems that this just lacks originality.That might seem a bit unfair, because 'lack of originality' may be attributed primarily to my familiarity with Enya's music, so that anything she does is going to start sounding just like her previous work.  However, some of the selections on this release seemed weak.Another way of putting this is that this release was too commercial.  It just appeared to have been cranked out for the money."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been a fan of Enya's music ever since the release of her second  album Watermark and after listening to this particular offering, I can  safely say it is the most exquisite music I have ever heard.  The vocal  layering and music form an absolutely magical sound that is uniquely Enya's  own;  and in combination with Roma Ryan's poetic lyrics, this is definitely  a match made in musical heaven.  There are no misses here as every song can  stand on it's own merit.  If you enjoy Enya's music this is an absolute  must have for your collection.  She just keeps getting better...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is positively one of the best albums ever released by Enya.  This album is filled with such powerful songs as 'Pax Deorum' and 'La Sonadora' that you will never want to listen to anything else.  From the very first song, 'The Memory of Trees', you will be enthralled and drawn by the music of this album.  These tunes are great to listen to when you are feeling down or sad, or pretty much any time.  These songs will captivate your heart with their powerful message and make you not want to let go or turn it off.I would suggest this album to any Enya fan right away, and even to those who have never heard Enya sing before.  You will get a great impression of her songs and be more interested to buy her other albums."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought Flyleaf's CD over the weekend and just had to put up a comment about it.  I would not rate this CD my favorite that I have bought in the past year but I would certainly put it into the top, oh I don't know, 20.  It is a good CD having many good tracks on it, but listening to Fully Alive on the radio then buying the CD and listening to the entire CD, the CD was different than what I expected, so that could be altering my judgement on it.  There is a bit too much screaming on the first track and another on it, I don't remember which one.  Buy the CD because it is worth your money, just don't buy it because you really like Fully Alive because many of the songs on the CD are not like that song, they are a bit heavier than that.  A good CD overall and I will be buying their next CD coming out."}

The lead singer's voice is incredible, I admit that I like the fact that a woman can yell like that.This one is going on my MP3 player and on my review forum at [...]"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Flyleaf have a thunderous, powerful sound that suits the songs' passion and emotion. Heavy guitar-based rock juxtaposes with secret weapon Lacey Mosley's sweet vocals (and she can roar with the best of them as well!). Every song is fabulously catchy, not a weak one in the bunch. My favorite is the instant classic 'I'm So Sick'. The five acoustic versions of selected songs show how diverse the band is by not just rearranging them but re-imagining them. The dark, goth-y DVD included kicks! This is a band to look out for."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am going to echo everyone who says that this cd hasn't left their player. Being someone that changes her cd every few songs it is rare for me to keep one cd replaying over and over. I love the combination of Lacey's sweet childlike voice mixed in with some well crafted hard rock notes. I had been going through  some down times in my life and this cd is just what I need. The lyrics and music really relate to my issues and help to find serenity in my faith. I recommend this everyone. A+"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When a friend casually asked me to pull up the \"I'm So Sick\" video on Flyleaf's Myspace page, I was a bit bored and tired. After a few bars of the opening baseline, I was already interested. Then Lacey screamed \"I Will Break\" and I was instantly excited and considering purchasing the album.In short, Flyleaf's music packs energy, enthusiasm, and an air of honesty (the latter being rare in our overproduced era, especially among younger bands). When my girlfriend, Jen, and I had the opportunity to see Flyleaf perform and spend an hour on their tour bus, we found more of the same love and ambition. These individuals have a genuine desire to spread hope to a hungry generation.This album is heavy enough for when you want to rock, and beautiful enough to accompany meditation or even prayer. Be cautious, however, because some of these songs have been stuck in my head for weeks at a time."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Flyleaf has found quite a bit of success touring with bands like Deftones. Their lead singer is female, and she is tiny at that. But don't let that turn you off. This isn't another average girl fronted metal band, like Kittie. She is able to convey so much emotion into every song it is unbelievable. It is a very solid cd. No filler. I'm excited for their next one too, because I think they have tons more potential. I mean, they've already sold over 500,000 copies of this one, which is pretty darn good. I don't think that everyone will like them, though. But if you're looking for something different as far as vocals go, try them."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It has been brought to my attention, by the people who left comments, that the review I wrote lacked good judgement and taste. It is one thing to say you don't like something, but to be rude and belligerent is wrong; nevertheless, I still do not like the band, and, therefore, I won't raise the amount of stars I gave at first, but  I do detract the words Appalling and vacuous.Fans of the band, please forgive me for being rude.The original review is below.The four and one half star rating of this album is beyond me.  The music is substandard, the singer, appalling, and the lyrics, vacuous! If you are looking for a female-fronted metal band, buy Tristania, Epica, After Forever, or Within Temptation.  This is a \"Fly leaf\" from a horrible book!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "i saw flyleaf a few nights ago in baton rouge, they opened for cold (and 10 years did as well--awesome by the way).  i bought there album that night and listened to it the next day.  i was pretty impressed with the album.  i see most people say the EP is better than the LP--i may buy the EP because i like harder music.  but the band is great (lacey's vocals are unique and pretty pleasing, but the band is just AWESOME--very catchy music!!).  all in all, flyleaf's debut album is a pretty good buy (i got it for $10 and its well worth it), and i recommend it.  Hopefully this isnt the last we've heard from the group, and hopefully they continue to grow and make even better music in the future!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Flyleaf has a hard-edged sound that combines raw, aggressive rock with some interesting vocals.Although it is not a type of music that is my usual taste, this album has a couple of quite memorable songs.  The band also injects some substantial meaning to their music.  Most of the songs start off quite angry, but there is a resolution to them that turns them around.Some of their lyrics are clearly Christian; others are more indistinguishable.Although I might not recommend the full album, there are some songs that are worth checking out on ITunes or elsewhere to see if one likes this.  I suggest checking out the following:  I'm So Sick, Cassie, and All Around Me."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've been a Skillet fan for years, and they just keep impressing me more with each album.  \"Comatose\" is a great blend of driving, hard rock with quick (though constant) infusions of synth rhythms.What's most amazing about this album, however, is the lyrical intimacy the band achieves in the midst of such hard rock.  Songs like \"The Last Night\" and \"Yours to Hold\" contain some beautiful lyrics of love, but they're couched in the midst of the screaming guitars and driving rhythms.\"Rebirthing\" and \"Whispers in the Dark\" show off the band's hard rock edge, while \"Say Goodbye\" and \"Looking for Angels\" are excellent ballads.  Overall, another winner from this incredible band."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I haven't been able to stop listening to this cd for three days. it's got a very new sound to it,which is awesome. It's not bland or boring at all, unlike some cd's these days.

{"label": 6, "raw": "Skillets previous albums \"Alien Youth\" and \"Collide\" was very catchy and wellperformed records with lots of emotion ,heaviness and melody but with this they have really set a huge landmark in the world of alternative rock. \"Comatose\" is packed to the limit with huuuge choruses and emotional lyrics mixed with huge string arrangements and crunchy postgrunge guitars! The biggest surprise of the year?! Skillet is definetely nominated!! =)Wonder if their next record could be better.....hardly bigger anyway!! ;)Thumbs up guys!! (and girls)Highlights: Rebirting, The Last Night, Say Goodbye"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Pre-Script: This is the only Skillet I own and have ever heard (I'm a new fan) so I don't want to say this is their best work cause I'm not sure, however here's my review for \"Comatose\":My Review: Well, the songs have already been rated so I'll leave them out but this is definitely a must-buy. I think Skillet is doing a really great thing: spreading of my savior Jesus Christ through MY personal favorite type of music: HEAVY METAL! But one thing that should be added is that this CD has extrememely good sound quality. Like, I can;t explain besides excellent songs, the CD opens up with crystal clear audio on \"Rebirthing\" and throughout. It's like an HD-CD.GO SKILLET ANED BUY THIS CD!I also reccommend:Demon HunterToby MacUnderoath"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I really liked Mythology and Black Utopia, though the engineering / mix on BU was poor. But this album is even worse. Musically it goes no where. Almost like he was trying to copy previous attempts but ran out of ideas. The \"Featuring Billy Idol and Slash\" thing is an absolute joke. Some how he got these guys to do an absolutely horrible version of In The Summertime. It's so bad it's hard to believe any one would put it on a CD other than to draw attention and sales from the names. Too bad, I had higher expectations from this guy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Derek Sherinian's latest \"Blood Of The Snake\" is an extremely enjoyable listen if you like guitar, keyboards, drums and bass. I am a huge fan of drummer Simon Phillips and I'm continuously amazed that after decades of playing with all the best musicians he still plays with such amazing punch and energy. He is an excellent jazz drummer and a powerful and complex rock drummer. My favorite track is \"Man With No Name\" where Zakk Wylde displays intense guitar work. I also enjoyed hearing Derek and John Petrucci perform together on the first track - man! that track rocks ferosciously! The entire CD is top-notch performances by everyone involved. Maybe not as great as \"Mythology\" which I consider to be his best work, but every bit well-worth owning and listening to. Enjoy the best!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "King Crimson uses part of the rock language ( with the instrumentation ) but adds something extra that makes the listener uneasy . The music is similar to their first album in that there are heavy songs put together with much lighter toned ones .Though I like the album a lot , it's not one I listen to for pleasure . If you were driving at night and were lost , this would not be the music to have playing .Beacuse a lot of the music is instrumental , the listener can conjure up mental images .It is intense and I recommend you hear it first before buying ."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Ever since being frightened by that screaming red face I've always been intrigued and drawn to this delightfully twisted band... LTIA, however, stands as the masterpiece of a band with a lineup that has always been my favorite...Wetton, Fripp, Bruford, Cross and Muir. The first three were all solid, but the addition of Muir and his whacky purcussive additions just complemented Bruford's already excellent chops (I wished Bruford could have played for BOTH Yes and KC - Yes was never the same after he left). Anyway, getting back to the album - won't say much more than what's already been said - this is an acid-trip album with eery, sleepy, disturbing and head-banging ferocity that showcases Fripp and his mates at their best."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A very good attempt by King Crimson on this set, using new singer, future Asia singer John Wetton, which is also on bass. Well anyways, this whole album is pretty inspiring with beggining to the end concepts. Starting with the title track which really rocks after the first 3 to 4 minutes of cymbals and xylaphones. Book of Saturday a little soft pretty good as far as sound goes. Exile a little more into the prog. My favorite on this album Easy Money, a lot here sounding as it could have gone on Dark Side of the Moon, as they were working on Money at the time, just a kick a** rocking tune with a kick a** beat to it. Then you get back into prog again with The Talking Drum, and the reprisal of Larks' Tongue in Aspic. Just a really good beginner album for those who never listened King Crimson, but heard of them. I would also prefer Three of a Perfect Pair too, very good and trippy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am listening to it right now. KC doesn't compromise. They are the Wagner of rock.Buy this and the complete King Crimson catalogue. If you don't like it, one of your grandkids will. Like lots of great music, King Crimson isn't appropriately revered in its time. One day, you'll be able to walk into any bar and there will always be least one Crimhead in the room.Music is my life. The music I am most passionate about is King Crimson.KC forever!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "So much of what is classfied as 'prog rock' is showing its age, and time has not been kind. This opus by the ever- mutable King Crimson only sounds better with the passage of time, and it's taken me years to fully appreciate what Fripp and co achieved with this unusual collection. For someone accustomed to the melodic progressions of Pink Floyd and (occasionally) Yes, LTIA came as a rude shock with its abrupt dynamic shifts and uneasy mixture of delicacy and brute force. This is 20th century contemporary music par excellence, and is undoubtedly an acquired taste. Stick with it, and approach without expectations. This is the greatest example of that much maligned and often misunderstood genre called 'Prog'"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Simply, one of the top prog records of all time.  Hard to get into at first, but every listen penetrates your soul until you get fully addicted to one of the most gifted and original rocK groups of all time.  Specially  interesting to guitarrists, bassists and drummers. This line up can hardly  be any better in creativity and chops. Also recommended: Red, Starless and  Bible Black, and Discipline studio Cd's.  There is also a recent wonderful  live compilation called Cirkus."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was a fan of King Crimson from the release of the first album. I saw this band premier this album. I didn't like it at the time because it was so radically different than the first four albums. It has aged well. The mix of electronic instuments and effects with all the percussion is very interesting. Frip's soloing on 'Easy Money' is fantastic. I wonder if Fripp was subconsciously undermining the singer because John Wetton has a good voice but the performances and the recorded sound of the voice is just terrible but there's only three songs with singing. Regardless of the flaws the music is so creative and powerful."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This latest version of Larks Tongues is so close to the 30th anniversary version in how it sounds that I almost have to say I don't hear a difference. I know, all of you Crimson folks out their are just a rabid as all of you Gentle Giant fans reading this. If it's a new version you MUST have it. NO Choice. Well I can say that I did notice a huge difference when I listened to the 5.1. That is where this release really shines. Get it for that and the videos. You have NO choice!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Larks Tongues in Aspic is the third King Crimson album you should buy (RedandIn the Court of the Crimson Kingshould be your first and second purchase, in that order). This album features the classic Crimson tune \"Easy Money,\" as well as the two part \"Larks Tongues in Aspic.\" Like most Crimson albums, each track is rather lengthy, with the exception of the short (2:56) \"Book of Saturdays.\" This can only be a good thing, since there's more music to love. I highly recommend this album for any progressive rock fan, or for anyone exploring the King Crimson experience."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "My first review of this album focused on the inaccessiblity of the music on this album to the average listener.  However, since, then, I've listened to the album enough to appreciate the depth and genius.  I will hold to my recommendation that this perhaps is not the best place for those uninitiated to King Crimson, but if you give this album a try, you will be rewarded.  It took a while for this album to click with me, but once it did I immediately started adding KC discs to my collection. Prog rock at it's finest from the John Wetton era.I would recommend listening to this album for the first time on a warm spring day, lying on your sofa, with the windows open enough to catch the scent of spring on the air, and to hear the sounds of the birds."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This album is a treasure mostly because the sound is unique to anything you will hear. No other artist will be able to imitate this sound, and even this very band, in any other lineup, couldn't imitate the sound. And it is definitely a cool sound.This is a great album to introduce yourself to King Crimson. The sound is very accessible, but remaining extremely experimental and artistic.The whole thing has a very dark and sinister tone to it, which definitely adds to the value of the music in my opinion.The album definitely isn't for everyone, and may put you in a weird mood if you listen to it too many times, or for too long, but I cannot deny that this is a class album.Also, don't judge the album solely by the samples that are provided on any website. :)The songs change quite a bit throughout."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've had the first King Crimson album for quite some time now, and I've always been a fan of theirs. This album, their sixth, released in 1972, is my new favorite. Can you imagine? Six albums over three to four years? Nobody does that these days, nobody! And don't even get me started with the Beatles! This is about \"Crim\", although I admit I love the Beatles as well... I'm still trying to figure out \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part I\" on my guitar, and it's quite challenging! In the words of Sean Penn's character in \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\": \"Awesome! Totally awesome!!\" Does anyone know of any available transcriptions of their music?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "OK, Here's the rundown - LTiA1 is pretty cool, although it runs a bit too long in my opinion.  Book of Saturday is an agreeable little tune with very nice vocals.  Exiles will remind you of the first couple o' KC  albums.Easy Money is similar to &quot;Cat Food&quot; and &quot;Ladies of  the Road,&quot;  The Talking Drum is pretty much a complete waste of space,  and finally LTiA2 is one of the best rock and roll tunes in exsitence and  is pretty much worth the price of the CD alone.&quot;Red&quot;,  &quot;Discipline&quot;, and &quot;The ConstruKction of Light&quot; are all  better KC CD's, but if you're a fan this is definitely worth the purchase."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "After listening to &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; which i thought was very good and had many beautiful moments, i was disappointed by Larks in that overall it sounded very dry and dull.  I fail to see what KC was trying to do when they recorded this album.  I wish they would have said something about that in the newspaper clippings in the albums liner notes.  Until i hear something about their purpose behind this album  i cannot apreciate this album from the standpoint of a music fan, there is just no emotion like there is in a Yes or Beatles recording.  &quot;Book of Saturdays&quot; is an ok song and &quot;Larks..pt.1&quot; is slightly interesting, but other than that i'm sorry i got this cd."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The second great version of King Crimson.  They came out of the box strong here, all members contributing brilliantly in some relatively equivalent proportion.  Robert Fripp has characterized his intention on some of the pieces as wanting to combine the passion you hear in African-American music and in Jimi Hendrix with aspects of the European tradition (precision and symmetry in composition) ala Stravinsky - he and the band actually did that here.  Music doesn't get much better than this.Larks' Tongue 1 &amp; 2, and Easy Money, fit the bill I've just described.  They are crafted, played, and recorded brilliantly.  &quot;Talking Drum&quot; is an effective jam, a study in rhythm and dissonance.  &quot;Book of Saturdays&quot; and &quot;Exiles&quot; are vocal ballads - I can actually live without them.  But that doesn't diminish the album, which is a real undereheard classic."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Well worth it for people who like interesting rock music. A grower, it might take a few listens. Bruford left Yes to join crimson, it seems like a good move because he can show his talents more. Apparently this album was a bit of a nightmare to record. Larks part 2 rocks hard and the tune was used in a film.  There's lots of interesting pecussion tricks and good bass playing. Robert Fripp steals the show with his Easy Money guitar showcase. Some nice ballads and long instrumentals too. Worth getting. thank you"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The title of this review is a slight exaggeration, but nevertheless this album has a classical element to it. Violins take center stage here, and permeate throughout. This album is definitely an acquired taste; the songs have very complex structures and have to build momentum. In many ways, this album is very bold, in the form of being very different. The standout tracks are EXILES and LARKS TONGUES IN ASPIC PART 2. EASY MONEY is good too, and features great bass work. I recommend this album for those who want a very progressive sound, and appreciate something totally outside the box. The violin really carries this album. The second half of the album is unexpectedly heavier than the first half."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "LTIA was the first in a trilogy of albums in which Crimso was attempting to prove that they were the scariest, most intense band in the world.  They succeeded here, although I feel they truly upped the ante on the succeeding LPs, &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; and &quot;Red&quot;--most particularly the last-named record.LTIA Pt. 1, with its whisper-quiet intro and loud, dissonant middle section, declares this intention immediately.  &quot;Easy Money&quot; proves it further, especially with the evil canned laughter at the end.  &quot;Book of Saturday&quot; is a lovely, abstractly despairing track.  The whole album is mesmerizing, and for me, LTIA, S&amp;BB and Red represent the best period in the group's choppy history, especially after the near-misses of ITWOP, Lizard and Islands."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If celebrated film director Ed Wood (Plan 9 From Outer Space) made an album, it would sound like this.  The Transformed Man by William Shatner isn't flawed or ill-conceived, it's perfectly dreadful, reaching sublime and awe-inspiring new heights of schlock.  Each passing minute finds listeners recoiling in astonishment as they struggle to believe their ears. This  smorgasbord of embarrassing implausibility and pompousness is only possible through the offices of Shatner's hideously bloated ego which has blinded him to the project's breathtaking stupidity.  If the phrase, \"So bad it's good,\" is in your lexicon, The Transformed Man just might be your guy.  (Warning: Do Not Operate Heavy Equipment While Listening To This CD.)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Performance art, pure and simple, as William Shatner juxtaposes poetry with pop lyrics in this 1968 release.Shatner's wry sense of humor is concealed in his presentation; spoken word with dramatic pauses, which punctuates with an exclamation point - or three - his theatre of the absurd. A parody on the pop culture of the day, it transforms \"The Captain\" into a vocalist with wit and a laugh.....seemingly a bad combination for someone who is supposed to be cruising the galaxy with a Vulcan, Scotty and Bones."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Shatner has said he knew he was being absurd when he made this, but I don't believe it for a second. I am convinced he thought he was being suave and interesting when he made this. Well, this is why IT IS so fantastic. It's the corniest record an actor ever made. When I first heard Mr. Tamborine Man I laughed long and hard...especially at the end when he screams so dramatically.Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds features Shatner sounding pained with indigestion, or drunk, as he delivers the lyrics to the Beatle classic. You can hear him smiling to himself in &quot;It was a very good year.&quot;Shatner doesn't sing so much as speak the lyrics to the songs he covers just like with the recent Best Buy commercials. Anyway, this would be a great &quot;bad&quot; gift to give someone. Shatner!! ...What a bloated cornball."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Borrowing a term Maddox once used, this album is an aural holocaust. The reason to buy this is to laugh at how terrible it is. While other more musically talented men avoided the problems of turning such classic rock songs as \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" into spoken word, Shatner attacked them...and then failed miserably. Surprisingly his music is possibly even more overdramatized than his acting and has unnatural melody-killing pauses for effect embedded throughout each song. It prevents casual listening or just enjoyable listening other than for comedic purposes."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Much debate has stemmed from this album - was Shatner playing a great practical joke on his fans or was he actually serious in reinterpreting the pop hits of the day to get his credentials in the Peace & Love Generation? Either way this is hilarious, and manages to be my favorite outsider recording aside from The Shaggs' \"Philosophy of the World\". Shatner's stone-cold emotionless renditions of \"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds\" and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" are cult favorites for good reason, and remain the most popular tracks off this album. However, the rest of the LP is just as classic. The good thing about William Shatner is that nowadays he realizes he IS William Shatner, and can look back at this ablum and enjoy it (I have yet to hear his new recording \"Has Been\"). One of the greatest mysteries in popular culture is wether this is a conceptual comedy masterpeice or a serious attempt at something meaningful. Either way, its a must-buy for fans of camp and kitsch."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "What can I say about this delightfully horrible recording that hasn't already been said? Shatner's ridiculously overdone Shakespearean soliloquies, paired with old pop standards that he talks through (rather than actually sings), is one of the greatest &amp; most famous `goof' albums ever made! It's truly bad, yet you just can't help but listen! My two faves are his covers of `Mr. Tambourine Man' and `Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds'. In both of these, he sounds like he's comin' down off of some really bad trips (which I believe was the idea in the first place!). Just cue this up at your next big Trekkie eppie marathon and let `er roll!`Late"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I found this DVD very inspirational in terms of motivating students of ballet to really work hard and strive for perfection.  It was interesting and informative to see how the Russian students were picked and what happens to them in their schooling, up to a final performance where they are seen by the public and how they later become successful dancers.  There is a wonderful segment showing the older student and how she learns old choreography from an older former great Russian ballerina, like it is handed down reverently from generation to generation.  I loved the dancing of these students, as well as the joy they showed in their training."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This candid, lovingly made 1977 tribute to the Kirov strivers who make big sacrifices to attend the legendary training ground of Balanchine is a sheer delight, both aesthetically and narratively, letting us peer into a highly disciplined world of pure art where expectations are high and the weight of tradition almost oppressive. With Grace Kelly's warm, vivid narration providing the context and translations, we watch as 20 students out of 1000 are carefully selected according to predetermined physical requirements, then spend close to a decade mastering their dance skills. You can't help feeling anxiety and then excitement watching one graduating ballerina make her heart-fluttering debut on the Kirov stage after months of punishing practice. \"Street\" is a tremendously enjoyable, behind-the-scenes look at greatness in the making."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Ananiashvili has the confidence that comes from knowing that she does not have to compromise with the laws of physics.  The rest of the company-- and I dare say the orchestra (it's Japanese)-- is not world class but good enough, but it is the prima ballerina \"natural\"  who rates five stars.  (Rothbart actually bops Odette on the noodle accidentally with his hand in Act 3.)  Particularly noteworthy are Ananiashvili's beautiful long arms, which undulate like fronds in subtle undersea currents.  She understands her characters, stays in character, and is charismatic.  See also her vivacious performance in Don Quixote."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this dvd to see the principals perform one of my favorite ballets and I was not disappointed, much. Both Ananiashvili and Fadeyetchev give wonderful and accurate performances.  This version is pretty much a traditional one, with most of Petipa's ideas.  I was a little disappointed that there was not much very new, exciting, and technically challenging, as one should expect at this point in ballet history.  The prince does not dance much in the first act, but they have given him a new solo adagio, which was refreshing.  Another refreshment is the fourth act which uses some music that is often cut out.  All the acts are a nice full length.  Aside for the sedate principal dancer's choreography, everything else is well done:  the costumes, sets, group choreography, and the character dancing.  Maybe this would not be my first choice in traditional Swan Lakes, but if you have a collection, as I do, this should find a place in it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought the VHS and subsequently DVD of this performance because of Nina.To me,she is currently the most accomplished classical ballet dancer.( hopefully she does not retire soon ).She has solid foot-works and always dances with great confidence.Her upper torso is so soft and expressive.This performance is of no difference.The only criticism I have is that the recording/video quality is not the best I've seen.It's ashamed that none of her performances of full length ballet at the ABT was recorded.That would have left us with important documents of what great classical ballet dancing should be.Brava Nina."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I guess my main concern with this film is that it plays out far more like a concert special than a documentary.  While watching Janis Joplin sing with all the soul and heart needed to sell practically anything is a delight, I really wanted more insight into who she was as an artist and as a human being.  Instead I was merely shown a few short interviews spliced between concert performances.  There is no depth here, unless you read between the lines of her music (which tells a very strong story and yet just isn&#8217;t enough here).  If you want to experience her music, raw and unfiltered then I suggest seeking this out, but if you want a true documentary on the life and times of Janis Joplin then you are going to be disappointed here."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you can get a hold of this rarity - do. Someday this should be digitalized and remastered on to DVD, but right now we're talking about them ol' VHS tapes. What makes this worth your while (the technically better footage of Janis singin' and tearin' up the joint can be found on the Monterey Pop complete collection, the Festival Express film, and extraordinary appearances with songs and interviews on the Dick Cavett compilation DVD) is some good interview footage, some memorable moments from a European tour, one song ending up with the first several rows of fans dancing on stage with her, and most of all her triumphant return to the Port Arthur, Texas high school reunion to face the prom set that had once persecuted her - Pearl among swine. Enjoy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Unfortunately I was not around when Janis hit the scene, however, watching this video makes me realize who she was as a person and entertainer.  I really love this and could watch it over and over.  I like the way they did the video- it has mixed studio sessions along with live performances and interviews with Janis all sprinkled together throughout.  Just listening to Janis talk is very plesant since you get the feeling that she was a hurting sole deep down but extremely intelligent as well.  She really knew how to rock a crowd though and all her performances- she gives it her all.  Many times after a live performance you see the audience come to their feet and clap.  I hope in the future they come out with more of these videos of Janis or at least put this on DVD- it's so neat to watch! 5/5 definitely"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Amazing live performances captured on film are the reason to see to see this.The interviews with Janis don't reveal much, and there's no real sense of her history. Even the stage stuff is shot pretty straightforwardly, but, man-o-man could she sing!One wonderful thing is that a lot of the numbers are uncut, allowed to go their full length, which, with Janis in concert, could easily be 8 minutes or more. The power, the emotion, the energy, the sexiness, the sweet sense of fun she brought to the stage could only be hinted at on her albums. For those reasons it's more than worth sitting through the slightly homogenized off-stage material.It awful to think that this is essentially unavailable.  Time for a decent DVD re-release!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Good show from Tom and the boys (and girls).  The video itself is dark but it is 25 years old.  It's still very entertaining.  Also very nice to watch a concert video where they film the band much more than the crowd.  I don't buy concert videos to watch the crowds.  Besides the darkness I only have two other complaints, having a pre-teen and a teen I could do without the off-color word used a few times (f---).  Number 2 why do they have to roll the ending credits over the last song?  Couldn't they have waited until the concert was over?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As a life-long TP fan, with reservations regarding some of the slightly obvious material, I bought this video when it came out.  Then lost it so some git who borrowed it and didn't return it.  Hard to get another copy in the UK, but it seems it is still around in the States.  It's kind of curious to watch a concert which occured before half the material played live these days was written - pre Wilburys, pre Full Moon Fever, pre Wildflowers.  Consequently it's a concert that Stan Lynch would presumably have approved of - Tp &amp; The H at their goodtime jangling finest.  It's as good as I remembered it, and my memory of it is the reason I've spent the last 10 years looking out for a new copy. Either it's very good or I'm an anorak.  Take your pick...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "That Jimmy is slow and uninterested in releasing this on DVD (as well as Tales from Margaritaville) says a lot about how little he cares about his fans.  In fact, most of his earlier albums greatly need remastering, and although he earns millions of dollars a year, he doesn't bother to do anything about this.  It's a shame that most fans don't see this, and Jimmy doesn't either.  Blind worship?As far as the concert goes, it's fairly good.  It does suffer some though from the time period (fluff songs like If the Phone Doesn't Ring It's Me, etc) and low lighting."}

That dude was awesome! He'd sit there and tell me stories about life in Giant Turtle Land and then he'd play air guitar along with Jerry's real guitar playing. Giant Turtle Guy was the best!Anyway, if you love the Dead, you'll totally love this movie. Get it and get a Grateful groove on..."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I cannot express in words how awesome this dvd set is. They did an excellent job with it in every way. The sound will blow you away, especially if you have a 5.1 system (you don't need it, there is a regular stereo sound option too) but the surround sound is insane.The extras are all top notch - stuff you actually want to watch. I have to say that this is probably the best music DVD purchase I have ever made - the content, the packaging the little booklet - it's all of the highest quality. Very highly recommended!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Deuter: try the soundtrack for the tunes cut short by the movie..five discs have all the movie stuff plus all the extra's.The movie itself is awesome.

David Lemieux (dead archivist) promises that they'll be more to come from this set of historic '74 Winterland \"farewell\" shows.P.S., the Dead wanted to document the ENTIRE Dead Head concert experience so all the audience coverage was deemed necessary as it aint a show without the Heads!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Grateful Dead Movie is a two-disc DVD showcasing the famous rock-and-roll band.

Audio options include the original theatrical audio mix and new Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 audio mixes from the master multi-track tapes.

{"label": 6, "raw": "The MET opera's previous production of Ballo, set in colonial America was premiered and recorded in 1980. Both Luciano Pavarotti and Katia Ricciarelli were at the height of their vocal powers and it shows. Pavarotti's love for the score translates well to the screen, even though he may not be the most imaginative actor around. Ricciarelli is even more effective as Amelia; as a singing actress of the highest order, her interpretation is both strong voiced and well acted. Louis Quilico as Renato is in good voice and Judith Blegen is a dashing Oscar. Bianca Berini is a bit of a low point as Ulrica, not eclipsing Florence Quivar in the subsequent MET recording. Patane's conducting is often at odds with his lead singers and the camera focus could be better at times, but this is a fantastic opportunity to see and hear both Pavarotti and Ricciarelli in their prime."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "this is an old movie starring animated farm animals in which this little girl plays with wilbur the pig a lot.what she doesnt know is todays porkbelly pigpen playmate is tomorrows barbeque.the spider likes wilbur too,so she spins messages of praise to wilbur for all to see.everyone gets in a uproar over this fascinating phenomenon and they hope to save wilbur this way.kids like it but theres a dead charlotte at the end so the emotional ones will be in teers.it is very much consistent with the book.my 4th grade teacher read it to us.its good too.the author e.b. white also wrote the trumpets of the swan and stuart little also.the message here is dont hold onto nothing for too long.especialy a big fat farm pig filled with pork chops and bacon.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  mmmm."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Everything is wrong in the disaster as all the charm, sadness and drama of this classic is gone. Charlotte should be a hairy spider with a Lucille LaVerne type voice, not a gorgeous arachnid with Miss Reynold's soothing tones. This is a story of friendship and self-sacrifice which is totally missing. And the tragic death of Charlotte, which is the highlight of the story, is simply glossed over. Along with The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch , Charlotte's Web is one of a trio of worst children's films of all time."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "for whatever reason with CHARLOTTES WEB it hasen't been digitally restored.this movie is just as good as any disney movie.but hasn't got the same treatment as one of their animated features,i don't knowwhy.i normally prefer the widesgreen versions of most movies but in the case of this original classic i believe the full screen is better its clearer and brighter.so until this movie gets a well deserved digital clen up full screen it is. the movie is as wonderful as ever great story for children of all ages.great music and a wonerful family film. the original classic dates back to 1972 but surpasses the 2006 live action nick remake."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you're a fan of the award-winning book, then I predict you'll enjoy this movie as well. The animation is lovely, the music is superb, and the characters are simply delightful.This movie is very innocent and genuine, something that you don't see very much of these days; with all these R-rated movies packed with violence and vulgarity and sexuality and heaven knows what else. \"Charlotte's Web\" has none of that. It is nothing but pure gentility and pure fun for the whole family. I absolutely love it, and I'm definitely looking forward to the release of the live-action version."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wilbur, the pig, is the loveable main character in this animated film based on the classic children's novel.  Newborn runt, Wilbur, is saved from certain death by farm girl Fern, but it is really Charlotte, the spider, who becomes his friend and ensures he will live a long life. A year in the life of a pig and a spider was never so entertaining or sentimental as in this movie.This is a great movie that both you and your children can enjoy.  There are some nice songs and the action is true to the book.  Henry Gibson is sweet as Wilbur, Debbie Reynolds is a no-nonsense Charlotte, and Paul Lynde is very funny as Templeton the rat.  A fun movie about the true meaning of friendship."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is not a Disney cartoon so the look is different.  But the level of animation is fine and isn't even noticeable because the video itself is so good.The story, song, and voice talents are extraordinary and this film easily gets 5 stars.  Any cartoon that has Debbie Reynolds, Paul Lynde, Henry Gibson, Dave Madden, Danny Bonaduce, and Agnes Moorehead has got to be top notch.  The music is also well done.  And of course the story from E. B. White is one of the classics.Kids and adults alike watch and rewatch this in my home and I recommend it highly for your video library.  Nothing objectionable at all in the film.  Enjoy!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "CHARLOTTE'S WEB is a family oriented and delightful adaptation of E.B. White's children's classic.  A rare venture by the Hanna Barbera team into full length movies, the film benefits from its rich colorizations and cartoon-like drawings.  We meet all the loveable characters:  the runt Wilbur (Henry Gibson), the pig who enlists the spider's aid in avoiding the bacon farm; Charlotte herself (a winsome Debbie Reynolds), a spider who spins words into her web to ensure Wilbur's existence; the ravenous mouse Templeton (Paul Lynde), who becomes Charlotte's aide, in coming up with the right words; and countless others, including a dotty Agnes Moorehead as the triple speaking goose.  The songs by Oscar winning Sherman Brothers (Mary Poppins) are banal and forgettable (with the exception of the lyrical \"Charlotte's Web), but they don't offend the viewer too badly.  All in all, a delightfully entertaining film for the whole family to share."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is my favorite opera production.  I consider it to be one of the greatest ever (as did Domingo).  Occasionally there is a camera problem, but it's minor.  This is a sexy opera and the stars give it right back to us.  Yes, I prefer Freni (my goddess) than Scotto, but Scotto makes up her vocal shrillness with her incredible acting.  This is a must see for Manon lovers and I can't wait to see it next year live at Seattle Opera.Enjoy, friends!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is well done and I have had in my collection for years along with Domingo and Kiri in Covent Garden production.  I love them both but prefer Covent Garden just a little over this one due to the chemistry of Domingo and TeKanawa who's singing is better than Scotto's as she was beginning to dim vocally.  However, the two productions are so different that they are both required for any opera collection.  Domingo fans will just love him in what he used to say was his &quot;favorite role&quot;.  I recommend both versions!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Some of the reviewers here dont understand this DVD,It starts off saying it's a Docu-Drama and that says it right.  It pretends to be a interview of two outragious guy's living in a strange place.The interviews are comedy sketches and pretty funny.The Paul Stanley mansion is sorta like the Playboy mansion with hot babes are around and Gene Simmons libes upstairs and it's large and gothic, very good writing, it's more like a well made low budget movie with music videos inserted in.Speaking of videos, there is a good stock of videos included from the mid 80's to the early make-up performances. Some of the videos are \"Tears are Falling\", \"Lick it Up\", \"I Love it Loud\", \"All Hells Breaking Loose\", Heavens on Fire\", \"Beth\" and more.A+ video, get it!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "...the rest is really just Paul and Gene mugging into the camera.  This is truly the era of KISS where Paul and Gene felt that the make-up days were the past and the present was where it was at.  Fast forward to 1995.....the make-up was where the $$$ was.If you want a pretty good compilation of KISS videos then this is a good buy.  That's about it.  The \"interviews\" with Gene and Paul are arrogant and insincere.  They both take verbal shots at Ace and Peter for no good reason.This DVD is just average.  When will they just start putting full concerts on CD/DVD?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this video when it first came out in the 80's when I was in high school. At the time, it was the closest thing I could do to actually getting my heros in my house. I had/have all their albums - both the 70's, 80 and now 90's.Other people have talked about what's on it, and if you are a fan, it's a MUST. The only reason why it doesn't get a 5/5 star review is because of the serious lack of extras. Call me spoiled, but why couldn't KISS at least do a audio commentary?! How about bloopers? Anything?! It's just such a disappointment when other bands put out great DVDs that you can tell go the extra mile for their fans (ie: Def Leppard, Sum 41, etc...)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "At least this release has a semblance of production to it.The greatest moments are the Classic KISS footage, and not the throw away non-makeup material. It has taken KISS 20 years to realise that the best and most lucrative material is the out and out concert footage, with all of the blasting phantasmagoria that is the original KISS.This video comes close to that original fantasy in some of the scripted material, but falls flat on oh too many ways, however, just before it goes through the floor, it gets rescued by another classic clip.There definitely should have been more of Eric Carr in the Video, but not of Bruce Kulick. However, the original is still the best, and that footage is why I give this disc 5 stars. Unfortunately it would still be better in the bootleg version, but its nice to have the Authorised version. Pity they cannot do more releases of the Classic and Re-united KISS ( However short lived that fabulous fanatasy was)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Whether you're a Pink Floyd fan or a David Gilmore fan, or just a fan of great music, this concert should be on your must have list. It's simply a magnificent display of artistic ability from David Gilmore. From acoustic to electric guitar, from old Pink Floyd songs to new Gilmore tunes, he covers it all masterfully. The supporting band is tight and what a pleasure to actually see a cellist jamming along with David and the band. If you like great music with equally great lyrics, then stop reading this and buy the DVD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "David Gilmour shines in this wonderfully produced and filmed live concert.  Every song is special.  If you like Pink Floyd or just good guitar, this is a must buy.  The extras are also quite spectacular.  Hearing David sing a Shakespeare poem was a real treat.  The home movies really give you insight into his life and music.  Oustanding!  Then, of course, there are the funny bits!  Like when Bob Geldolf can't remember the words for Comfortably Numb and has to read them off of paper!  OMG!  He really needed paper!  Thankfully, that was an extra and not part of the main concert footage.  Buy and enjoy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Acoustic Pink Floyd?!  Is it worth it?To a large degree, yes.  Gilmour plays a rather intimate show featuring some Floyd, some solo work, a couple of Syd Barrett's tunes, a cover or two or three, and a surprisingly good song from guest Richard Wright.  Excellent 5.1 sound and a few bonus features.It may not satisfy all of the Pink Floyd fans chomping at the bit for &quot;Pulse&quot; to be released on DVD (AND JUST WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THAT?!  GET ON THE BALL, WHOEVER YOU GUYS ARE!), but it is an interesting and satisfying consolation prize for the rest of us."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First -  I love David Gilmour...and believe he was more the 'sound' of Pink Floyd than Roger.  Upon reading reviews of this DVD \"David Gilmour in Concert 2002\", I bought it over the more expensive Royal Albert Hall DVD.  Mistake.  This one, though a quality performance, is not \"Pink Floyd re-visited\" and has ZERO songs from his first two solid albums from back in the 80s (David Gilmour and About Face).  It is a bunch of slow, 'On an Island' type songs from I don't know where and multiple versions of PF songs that all began to sound the same...  I had to fast forward several times.  The redeeming feature of this DVD is the Extras.  The DVD is 'only' $10, but I don't see myself ever watching it again so...not worth the money."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'm a big Gilmour fan - love his solo output... think Pink Floyd without Waters was just fine... think his vocals and guitar was what made classic Pink Floyd \"classic\"...But, this DVD was sort of sad to watch.  The acoustic setting makes it all to easy to see that Gilmour has gone way past his prime.  He can no longer sing, and his guitar playing - without effects - is mediocre at best.I was absoutely certain that I would love this DVD when I bought it, but by the 6th song or so I was ready to turn if off.  I don't understand all the 5-star reviews... search out some of the lower reviews and you'll see they echo(es) my sentiment.BTW, for a better taste of Floyd from the 21st century, check out Roger Waters' \"In the Flesh\".  Even though I generally side with Gilmour in the Gilmour/Waters feuds, Water's DVD is infinitely more polished and entertaining than this one..."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Looks like David wanted to get away from the Floyd Pomp that began after their success with the Dark Side of the Moon and carried them into a marketing hodge podge of pretense such as floating animals and the like.A good selection of songs played surprisingly on Electric-Acoustic guitar which he seems to favour. He has an excellent back-up band and brings many of the Floyd songs down to earth.Quite a nice set but could have been longer. Wish You Were Here and several other classics have nice rendering with an excellent bassist. A nice guest appearance by Richard Wright. It is a shame as far I know he did not tour his solo album which may be the better of all the PF solo CD's. David Gilmour's willingness to give way to Richard Wright for one of his numbers and his excellent Guitar on it is a highlight.All in all a very good Live Performance."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I remember this concert well...but as they say of the '60s, if your can remember it you weren't there. I was a teen back then (September 1981) and like most of the hundreds of thousands of others there I was smoking myself a \"J\". Me and a friend got a good place as everyone packed in hours before the show. Then I had to take a leak. Unfortunately it took an hour of stepping over a mass of stoned people to find somewhere to go, and as the concert started I gradually found my way back.Mrs. Robinson starts it off. Then Homeward Bound, America, Me and Julio, Scarborough Fair, April Come She Will, Still Crazy, Late in the Evening, and it ends with Old Friends, Bookends, Sounds of Silence, and everything in between.It was a true musical happening."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a very, very good concert featuring most of the famous singing duo's best songs, of which there were many. There is a good mix of fast and slow songs and so-so stereo. Too bad they couldn't have re-mixed this in 5.1surround sound for the DVD.Simon and Garfunkel are such pros. The two harmonize so well it's amazing and even though they were live, playing in front of a mammoth crowd, most of their songs sound like perfect studio takes. Yes, a couple might not sound as good as those original studio recordings but some - thanks to the great backup band here - sound even better than the originals!  Best of all, there are no \"clunkers\" in this group.The boys looked a bit smug, but when you can draw literally hundreds of thousands of fans to a concert, I guess it's hard to be humble. They were real superstars of their music era."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is pretty good..including all the great Simon and Garfunkel classics.  Hard to believe the recording was made 22 years ago. Where has the time gone?  Holy Cow!!It seemed like they rushed through a lot of the songs, apparently to keep the crowd energized.  The slow songs, like \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and \"April\" were the best. Art Garfunkel's vocals, what he adds to vocal harmony is what makes Simon and Garfunkel.  Sure Paul Simon is good, but I'm more of a Garfunkel fan.GOOD BLAST FROM THE PAST.  IN 1982, I WAS ONLY 22 YEARS OLD...YIKES."}

This DVD is a new release too....but why isn't it available directly from Amazon?  They ran out??  It just came out, and it is a major release (I thought...). They must want everybody to go for the Blu-Ray or Hi-Def versions.  But what if you don't have the type of player?  What happened to the regular DVD???  Someone straighten me out here...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I rented this on Blu-ray and was amazed at how it sounds.  I listened to it in True-HD and I do not think I have heard a better sounding \"live\" concert. Really amazing and the mix is not over done.  I think 5.1 mixes should be done to make the music sound more realistic with depth and clarity and this does that.Only complaint is that they really do not use the center speaker and all and the movie cuts into songs and I really don't care about the movie footage, I just want to see the songs performed without interruption. They should re-edit the film and place all movie footage between songs!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Really I did -- usually along with Rocky Horror or a Jimi Hendrix film.  Had no choice since there was no video footage available to buy at the time.  Some parts are hokey, and it's a shame most performances are cut, but it's Zep in their heyday.  Does anyone else notice how much Crowe's \"Almost Famous\" rips off this movie (all the way down to the acoustic-accompanied limo ride through NYC)?  A better choice is the double Carruthers DVD.  That shows Zeppelin from their origins to their later years in un-cut performances."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was pretty impressed when I saw this when it first came out [in a theatre]. While its flaws are more obvious now, it is worth having for any Zep fan. The fantasy sequences are a bit silly at times, Planty's ego is too and some of the performances are a bit dodgy against Zeppelin's best work. But it is worth it just for the 25 minute 'Dazed And Confused', a magic moment in rock history, rambling but not a note out of place. Here and in some other parts, it is a joy to watch the band,Page especially, at work."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I made the mistake of buying the newest DVD before this one.  There is no comparison.  I was used to hearing these tracks from the album of the same name, and the movie format it is unedited, usually a good thing.  But I found the sound track fading in and out at the most inopportune times.  No Quarter from the album has the most riveting organ and guitar solo, but it must have been filmed on a different night for the film, because it is shorter and lacks bravado.  Yes, the fantasy sequences are a bit dated and cheesy but that comes with the territory of the film and when it was made.  Overall it is still good but nothing compares to the newest DVD for live musical content.A must for any Zep fan to have."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Led Zepellin is possibly inch by inch, the most complete, authentic and original rock band in the last sixties and seventies. From the riffs of Jimmy Page, to Bonham's drums. This concert on Madison Garden is not only a historical document but a timeless proof for the new generations who will born about the stature and presence of this heavy band. The ensemble, the original arrangements, the language and score of every one of his pieces will engage. I love from that age Moby Dick in which Bonham will give us a true tour de force, Lemon Song for instance, that was not played. I didn't like Whole lotta ` love , and to my mind Stairway to heaven, Rock& Roll and Moby Dick were the jewels of the crown.An unforgettable spectacle all the way."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Have they separated the \"dream sequences\" from the middle of the songs?If they did, this will become one of the greatest concert films ever.If not, toss it in the trash can as some of the most embarrassing, boring statements ever.#1 kick A$$ band of all times.Having seen Zeppelin in the 70's more then a few times.Also going to see this when it first came out and watching people walk out in groups.Let you all know the original generation of fans were not pleased.Don't let the retrospective pushers make you believe this was the real deal.Even during the \"midnight\" showings in the theaters. Most went outside to have a beer, or smoke a joint.Or stay inside and sleep.After all it is Led Zeppelin, and it's true their worst was still better then most everybody else's best.Get the Zeppelin DVD if you want something close to the real deal."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "Led Zeppelin never got any better than this. There are videos available of their '75 and '77 tours as well as footage kicking around from the Knebworth festival, but this band peaked in 1973 and for those of us who fell out of love with the band by \"In Through the Out Door\" and Plant's wretched solo  material, this video is a great reminder of why Zep was a sold out huge arenas and sold millions of albums.My faves are the title song with it's great 12-string and 6-string mix,John Paul Jones \"No Quarter\",the BEST solo on \"Stairway to Heaven\" available and an excellent show closer which I won't name in case you haven't seen this yet.This is how it should be and how this band should be remembered."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Outstanding. The \"Rockumentary\" shows the footage from Led Zeppelin's concert in New York city as well as a bit from their personal lives.The viewer gets an idea of what it's like from their end of the tour as well as some of the most outstanding music ever in concert.Most noteworthy is the drum solo from \"Moby Dick\" from the late John Bonham.It is long,but anything but boring.Overall,this is evidence of why their will never again be quite a decade like the 1970s for music."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is footage of Led Zeppelin at their peak period. The '73 tour, apart from the fact Plant's voice had already changed, is the best tour Zeppelin ever had. This film captures it. The sound is much more powerful than any other live releases, and the playing is perfectly typical of Zep in '73. It doesn't get any better. Certainly not the '75, '77, Knebworth, or early footage you get with the Led Zeppelin dvd. Don't be fooled by people who join the decades long critical bashing bandwagon. Some things get branded because it is easy to go along with the popular, yet incorrect, perception."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is still one of the best concert films ever made, one that holds up to repeated viewing not only for the quality of the performance but the narrative of the film.  While the fantasy sequences and photographic embellishments may seem kitschy to some, they hold up remarkably well, adding a mythic dimension to the music.This was the film that made me a Led Zeppelin fan, and it's great to have it on Blu-Ray.  The video is astonishingly good for a film of this vintage.  There's grain in some of the outdoor footage, probably due to its having been shot with cheap equipment.  Overall, the colors are bright, vivid and crisp, and the picture is razor-sharp.  The Dolby TrueHD soundtrack will knock your socks off.  Wait till the neighbors are out and crank it up!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First off, I love Zeppelin and The Song Remains the Same is an excellent live album and film.  But let me just pose a question:  Why is Amazon advertising this HDDVD if according to them it's not being released for 2 more years?  Huh??!!  By that time we could be downloading movies directly into our heads - a little \"Led for your head,\" so to speak.  Seriously Amazon, either figure out what's going on or take down this item."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A great performance, unfortunately undermined by a director and editor who think the movie is about them. The \"dramatic\" sequences are moronic in the extreme, and it's amazingly annoying to have the camera cut away from the performance to such pointless scenes as a bridge going by from a car. As though a band of this caliber and power needs some kind of visual support to make it interesting. . .  And even when they do allow us footage of the performance, there are a number of places where the visuals and the sound are completely unrelated---not just out of sync but Jimmy Page playing some other song than the song we're listening to.  It's worth getting for the performance, if you can tolerate all the nonsense you have to wade through to get to it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Having not bought this item I thought it was great. You may not have heard of Led Zeppelin because they are an obscure rock band from the 70's that now with the re-release of this re-release have released a new set of remixed re-releases that might, for the impoverished group, gain them some of the reputation they justly deserve. These tracks are remastered and remixed from the original remasters and remixed again to give a re-re-mastered quality remix, the likes of which you have never heard before. The packaging, which I haven't seen, is very poorly designed with flimsy card-board and undersized T-Shirt."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Although it looks great and what is there sounds great, Someone,I assume Jimmy Page, has made sweeping audio edits throughout the concert, jarringly restructuring some of the guitar work and \"fixing\" some of the \"mistakes.\" The good thing is that if you are not a dyed-in-the-wool Zeppelin fan--or just a casual one--you may not notice the copious alterations; however, if you've been rocking out to this show for years and know it inside and out, it is hard not to lament the changes when they, in most cases, neuter, or remove altogether, some of the swagger and spontaneity that crept into the original mix.I will keep my VHS, laserdisc, and original DVD release of this film and will retire this blu-ray and its revisionist audio mix to the forgotten dustbins of my garage."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a bloated, self-indulgent, boring mess.  When this film came out, I remember thinking that if thisis the great Led Zeppelin, then they are quite overrated.  Some of the songs are way too long, the videosequences are almost laughable and Plant is either having a bad night or is already struggling to be thePlant of a few years earlier.  Get the excellent double DVD \"Led Zeppelin\" instead - way, way better.It not only shows the band at various points in their fairly brief history but does indeed demonstatewhat a terrific group they actually were.  In its wake, \"Song\" is now useless."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a &#34;cleaned up and expanded&#34; version of the 1976 release.  The sound, arrangement, and bonus material are fantastic.  I have fond memories associated with the original version and this new version only adds to those wonderful memories.  Some fans and critics have stated that these concert clips do not represent Zep at their best.  But, for me, I think they still stand head and shoulders above anyone else --- both in terms of musicianship and entertainment.  Unfortunately, I never had the chance to see the band live, but through this DVD set, at least I can imagine."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Robert Plant and Jimmy Page were always somewhat disappointed with The Song Remains the Same, and it's not hard to see why...Some choppy and grainy video, not the highest-fidelity sound and certainly not one of their best live performances. But still, even Led Zep in a mediocre format is still 10 times better than just about anybody else out there. This is a also a great disc for younger Zeppelin fans to get a sense of what this band was like, including how crazy-huge they were, in their day.I actually like the cheesy shorts in this movie. It fits the mood of the time to a T, and they are funny besides."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was born in 1977 (around the time they cancelled the tour when Plant's son died), so I never got to see the Zep in concert. So I was pretty excited when I heard that this video was available a while back.But there are a few things that I noticed. Plant sounded like he was losing his voice, the music wasn't always synched with the video, too many &quot;cheesy&quot; (IMO anyway) effects, etc. This couldn't possibly have been the best footage available, could it? As much of a ZepHead as I am, I still cannot call this the best representation of them on film. It isn't, from what I've seen otherwise.Most expensive home movie ever made? Feels like it. I enjoyed the music, but the visual needed more work."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "in 1973 an amateur film crew made a half-assed effort to film Led Zeppelin on 3 below average nights at  Madison Square Garden on the nights of 27, 28, and 29 July 1973. The film was entirely financed by the band and shot on 35mm with a 24-track quadraphonic sound recording. In 1976 in an effort to pacify an impatient label, the film  started by director Joe Massot, would be finished by director Peter Cliffton and released in theaters all over the world.The special addition includes the missing songs that complete the setlist but they are not &#34;branched&#34; into the original DVD to restore the original continuity of the live set but rather included separately on the bonus DVD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the very best live concert video by AC/DC capturing the band at their peak and featuring the legendary Bon Scott.  I first saw this film on VHS back in the early 80s.  When the DVD format came out, I assumed that this would be one of the first live concerts issued.  But it took >10 years - I have no idea why.  Better late than never.  The video looks great; the audio is less than perfect, but good enough.  It's my favorite AC/DC video by far."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Amazing!!!!  It is rare indeed to find the kind of quality document that this beautifully restored film is.  The sound is round and full in both 2 channel and surround.  The DTS Master audio is actually a marvel.  Thunderous!  The picture is fantastic considering how long ago this was filmed.  I only wish there were more of this band at their peak, and for that matter for many other artists of that time.  The extra features are average, but nice with interviews of current and past rock greats commenting on AC/DC's influence, etc.  If you are a fan, than this is an absolute MUST!!"}

Package: very nice metal box, everything cool.c. Extras: the cards are ok. The pick also. The little book about the concert is well written. The really weak spot are the interviews, a bunch of guys (including awful Susan Masino) saying how great, magic, stupendous, marvellous, geniuses, beatutiful, breathtaking, everybody in AC/DC is.d. And, of course, you will not get a single special new interview made for this product by AC/DC themselves. (maybe due to Sony/Warner rights)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Impressive product for AC/DC fans!  Paris show content is wonderful; the concert was captured very well, highlighting the entire band while giving the spotlight to Bon and Angus when appropriate.  The film is easy to watch; it doesn't bounce around from shot to shot too often.  And the sound is great!Terrific tribute to Bon as this was the pinnacle of his career, and was captured shortly before his untimely death.  Extra content is okay.  Most is present-day tributes by various artists and critics which can get a bit redundant.  Documentary-style content of the band as it was during original filming gives us insight as to the humility of 5 working-class musicians just trying to have fun.Print content is wonderful history for those of us that don't know everything there is to know about the band.Amazon fulfillment was perfect as expected.  Product was available and shipped promptly upon order, arriving in new condition when anticipated."}

The sound is quite good for what's there & the picture is AMAZING, great HD transfer there.  The sound should be much more powerful considering the band involved, but have been waiting for this on DVD for eight years so not complaining too much.  Really pleased to see this old Bon footage finally put out in this format.  Da' Wolf"}

And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for very long. I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up."}

They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone). Can't go wrong with the price and certainly can't argue with the benefits of OEM vs. generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The big store that is in every town now (can't say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord. The cord itself is ok ;however, the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such, is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in, it worked fine. So if you need a cord its ok; however, it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless. For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Was here right on time.Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was the,Whole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient ..... The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well....I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems....I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct!Ugh!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is good and the shipping is quick. The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm. Overall I feel my phone secured in the case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "A note of caution from someone who owned and used just about every major Blackberry model: if you already own a standard USB 2.0 cable and you don't need an extra, then you do NOT need this cable. All a Blackberry needs for data transfer is a STANDARD USB 2.0 cable with a Micro-USB connector at one end.There is NOTHING special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated MSRP listed for it. While this item is sold at a 90% off the MSRP discount, it's probably okay to purchase one, for as long as, after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a USB 2.0 cable.The items has 2 stars taken away for the exaggerated marketing claim (professional grade custom cable) and for the inflated MSRP.NOTE: Please make sure that you buy cable with a MICRO-USB connector because this is what your Blackberry needs."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is. I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode. So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else...spend the extra buck on a higher end cable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews.  I don't know how people are getting these cables to work... but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about \"Unknown Device\" and \"Could not install drivers\" even though it works beautifully with the original cable.  The only setting that works is \"Just Charge\"!  Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw!  I've tried this with my Wife's Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well.  Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2.99 shipped to my door.  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging.  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge.  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers.  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised.  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc., and at less than 25% of the cost.  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is clearly not a HTC cable as it has the Blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says Blackberry...but it's a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into.While I haven't tested it's speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that's all I asked for of it.The cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so.It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product, that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product, this cable is 1m long."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Paid $0.32 for the charger and $2.81 Shipping & Handling.....Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work.....which is an all day job huh?  LOL!  Wow, I wish I could write reviews for a living wouldn't that be nice?  I think the total price of $$3.13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $10-$20.  Ms_Thrifty has done it again!  Stay tune to more reviews, Oh how I love Amazon!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this.  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth.  Overall good purchase for the money."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out.  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I don't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound.  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws. The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job, so mission accomplished. The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft, meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you're screwing. (Sorry, there's no other way to say that.) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances. I think this set will come in very handy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Torx screw drivers work wonderfully and the tweezers work well, but the pry tool is too weak and ineffectual for the project I used them on.I bought this kit to remove the cameras out of my HTC 4G LTE and I didn't have any problems except for removing the small plastic portion on the bottom rear side of the phone.  The pry tool was way too flimsy for the job and I'm not convinced that it would do the trick for any similar function.I'd recommend this kit if you primarily purchased it for the Torx drivers but not if you require the use of the pry tool as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This comes with 4 flats and 2 philips. I believe they are also metric in sizes. I used one to take a part a netbook. I like the fact that they spin, come in a plastic kit. They are reasonably priced. These items are high quality. Handles are small and can be hard to loosen a screw if torqued down. I used them for a laptop not as a jeweler so... Nice case, nice color, small area, ... Comes in a card board cover as well. Packaged and more packaged. A little over doing it there. Can't be at times a little difficult to open the plastic case. Was going push up or down. Comes with different sizes. Some of the flats seemed a little thick in the blade. Not a bad item for the price. Always good to have a set of these around for glasses/sunglasses or for other items with small screws."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much. The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked, once it's in the phone it is not an issue. So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced. So far I would recommend this battery.Update: 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything. Drained it and charged from dead several times, made sure that location services, blue tooth, apps closed... all OFF and still drained. Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery.... A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I must agree with Gary Tuscon's review. For under $5, even though the smallest flat-head screwdriver in here is 1.4 mm (too large for the screws that hold the links on a Seiko women's watchband), the quality is such that I will keep them. The case is very good and labeled very clearly. The screwdrivers have a decent weight as well and the handles turn smoothy.If these came in smaller sizes, with tempered tips that smaller sized tools need to be strong, I would definitely consider them as well.If I had one minor nitpick, it would be that a color-coding of the handles would be a great help, but really, this is an excellent value for the price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After viewing some youtube videos on this procedure, I was able to swap the battery in about 1/2 hour (which included taking pictures and studying the insides of the iPhone 4S.The tools are good enough to get the job done -- I never felt that the tools were going to fall apart.  In fact, I'm keeping them around for other mobile phone work.The only thing I'd recommend (esp. for older folks with not-so-good eyesight) is a good way to magnify things so you can see what you're doing.  I use a big magnifying glass, 1.5x reading glasses (3x would be better), a headlamp (to add light where I need it)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "You may not need these types of screwdrivers often, but when you do need them, nothing else will do.  They're great for tightening eyeglass screws or opening up the cases of small electronic devices.This is a nice set.  It comes with 4 slotted and 2 philips style in a variety of sizes. They seem to be well made and I suspect that they last a long time. The swivel heads allow you to put downward pressure on the screwdriver as you turn it to minimize the risk of stripping the head on delicate small screws. The case has a labeled space for each screwdriver. It's your typical plastic case with a snap top and should hold up as long as you don't step on it or drop something on it.  This set is a nice value for the price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "For the price, you cannot beat this little Stanley screwdriver set.  This one features several very tiny standard and Phillips head screwdrivers.  If you have a need for very small head screwdrivers, this one is for you.  These are useful for messing with eyeglasses, certain electronics gadgets, and firearms.  I have several revolvers and pistols which have sight adjustments that have outrageously small adjustment screws.  For these sights this little kit is a must -- none of my other tools could manage to fit these screws but this one did.  That alone made it worth the Amazon price and this little kit has a permanent place in my range shooting bag.  RJB."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset.  The Era comes with 9 different options for ear inserts.  But I always felt like the earpiece was about to fall out, unless I jammed it into my ear so far that it became uncomfortable.Enter the Jabra EarGels...  These made a huge difference.  It fit perfectly onto my ear (the nub on the top goes into the spot above the ear hole).  I could wear this all day.  I wouldn't wear these eargels without having an over-the-ear hook attachment on my Era, but these have made a huge difference for the comfort of my bluetooth earpiece."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who's cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door. I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter. I more than got my money's worth out of it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have a cassette player in my car and wanted to be able to plug my MP3 player into it. This adapter looks like a cassette with a wire coming out of the end. It slides into my car player and when I plug it up to my mp3 player, it plays through the system with no problem. I have not had any trouble from it yet as others have written about. I went on a trip 2 weeks ago and used it for several hours. It worked great.  The wire can be changed to come out of the side or the back, depending on which way your auto player is oriented."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Seems great at first. But sound is kind of shaky, almost like the magnetic head is not making good contact. Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it's hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again. It'll get stuck in this infinite loop. You have to take it out, smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in. Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell. pull on your device too quickly and it'll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I fixed the issues, for the time being.  I turned down the bass on my stereo.  I also made the default volume 75% on my phone.  This is the combination that worked for me.  I also left the casette in.  I figured if there was dust and other stuff in there, then i would have to let it settle.  The burn in period was about 3 days.  Afterwards it was AMAZING, the sound clarity improved so much. So don't give up, try these things. You may need to clear the dust from inside your tape player, I'm sure that may be the cause of many issues.Fix eject issue:[...]"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Overall, I think that it's a safe investment in a mobile phone. One sad thing about cell phones is that they improve so quickly, there's always a race to have the best.Right now, this phone is one of the best, without the 300+ pricetag. If you're paying 300 for it, you aren't getting a good deal.Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display. Only downside is the wiping it off thing. Oils form your skin and ear show up easily on the pristine surface. Very clear pictures and nice graphics.I give it a 10 out of 10."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work.Unfortunately it didn't work that well. I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo. Worst of all it was supposed to block outside sound, but it didn't do this at all.I know that it was designed for xbox so I am not going to give it 1 star. I don't have a home phone so I haven't tried it for that."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it.  Well, my husband tried it and decided he needed it since he did a lot of driving for work.  I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back.I love that I can use these with my cordless phones as well as my cell phone.  I prefer the corded sets, they just seem to have a better sound quality.  I love that this earpiece fits snuggly around your lobe.  I wear glasses and this works out great.  I go between this style and one that wraps around my head, it just depends on which handset I pick up.  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "More importantly, the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap, thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly.  When mine arrived, it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in.  No box, no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band, just chucked it into a bag.  I realize it's super cheap but it should last a month.  Is there we are at now?  I wish Amazon would be... at all selective on what they offer for sale."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers.  One tried to get it to work, and finally gave up.  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call.  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time...if there is a next time."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I don't want to rehash all of the stuff that's already been said about this phone. Here's something that nobody told me before I bought it: You cannot use the Infrared port on this phone to transfer data to and from it using a PC. You can use the infrared on the phone as a wireless modem for Internet connectivity (this works for me) but the EasyGPRS software provided to manage phone entries etc. does not work with Infrared. I've checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this. When I called tech support they suggest that I buy their data cable (read: shell out another $70) for that purpose. It is very misleading to show this phone as being IR equipped while its use is crippled.BTW, I gave this phone 4 stars because it is still a sleek looking great phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have to say that this is a great phone and the Nextel service is great also.As for the review from the moron from Denver You need to have used it and the service before you open your mouth and make a fool of your self.People that review something and not have a clue just goes to show that stupid people should not breed.I have had the I90c,I95cl and the i730 and the 730 is great as for a alarm buy a clock if you need a alarm.The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it,the sound is as good as the other phones I have had.As for service I have had every carrier that is in the state of Colorado and Nextel is the best and for any one who is thinking of Verizon for push to talk well it sould be push to wait.If you want the best this phone and service is the best."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this set of adapters specifically for a trip to Europe. There are two different Europe plugs, I took them both, and they both worked everywhere I went.I used the adapters primarily in Denmark and Norway, they worked great and gave me no problems charging iPod, iPhone, iPad, camera batteries, etc.Note that there are numbers on the plugs, the numbers correspond to the cardboard insert to let you know where to use the plugs. It would be better if the plugs themselves had that information on them, but at least they have the numbers (which I didn't see at first so I put my own numbers on them).I will undoubtedly keep using the adapters on future trips, and I'll keep this updated.Update:Have also now used in Thailand, worked great."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really like this hub.  I have an Acer One Netbook, and I use this hub to power my cd/dvd external drive, my laptop cooler pad, and my 1tb external hard drive.  My cooler pad also has a few usb ports, and I have a 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged into that.  Everything works fine.  Sometimes I have to unplug my cd/dvd drive to get the netbook to read it properly.  I had that same problem with another hub though, so I think it's the drive.  It works more often with this hub than with my other though.This is very small.  The main picture makes it look huge, but it's really palm sized. I took it with me on vacation, and it fit just fine in the carry-on.  You don't need to keep the stand on it.I also like the one port in the front for when I need to plug in a usb drive."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Because of proliferation of USB based products, the USB hub is now more neccessary than ever. If you have multiple USB based devices (printers, keyboard, mouse, flash storage, USB speakers, iphone/ipod jack etc) and want to consolidate all your devices into a one single hub, then this hub does its job well.This devices works equally well both in Windows (Vista) and Mac OS (Leopard and Snow Leopard).It is about half the size of a medium sized hand.Each USB port has its own dedicated LED light. The LED light indicators, however, are little brighter than I would like. It MAY bother those who are extremely light sensitive while sleeping. But a cheap way to alleviate such a problem would be to cover the LED lights with tape.I used this device as a hub for all my USB devices for my MacBook Pro (2009) and the device works flawlessly, including for my USB speakers."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I use this on my MacBook so I can connect several items at the same time including a USB keyboard and optical mouse, my iPad and iPhone, a webcam, an external hard drive and even a light o Rama controller for my Christmas lights. This thing works great and provides plenty of power for all devices. I haven't seen any slowness in my webcam, iPad/iPhone syncing or even copying large movies to my external hard drive. This guy works great and I am not at all disappointed in performance. I am however a bit disappointed in the design. This has to sit on the corner of my desk and i need plenty of room on both sides to allow the USB cables to plug in. I would have had them design it like a tower with the plugs all on the back one on top of another. That being said, the current design does offer some added stability to keep the hub from falling over. Overall a great performer and a decent design."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I gave this 3 stars because it does what it says, its nothing high end and doesn't promise miracles, but I won't give it 5 stars because simply there's a terrible delay from when my computer comes out of sleep mode and from the time it actually recognizes this hub on the com ports for the PC, on average its about 15 seconds.  So I'll be sitting there waiting to enter my password like an idiot until the hub is finally recognized by the PC.  And its a really good PC, brand new, no problems with USB 2 or USB 3 except where this hub is concerned."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "1. The USB ports on the sides are spaced far enough apart that I can use all the slots. And the one in front is great for the thumb drive.2. The lights are cool3.

I righted it and it was fine all day.The weighted base does make a difference and I think they made it as heavy as they could without taking away the portability feature.5. Did I mention it works great. My laptop had no problem going to sleep. It was instantly recognized. All the devices I've put on it have been recognized6. I don't know what one reviewer meant by it making noise. Mine is absolutely silent.7. I agree you need a scissors or knife to open the clamshell packaging no biggie.I liked it so much I bought a second one!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "A very good high quality USB hub. Windows recognizes everything you plug into this hub and, the USB ports are nice and tight.I will say in my opinion, for a USB 2.0 hub, the Cyberpower-CP-H720 is at the top of the quality hub chart. You can plug a DVD player or web cam into this thing and it will work perfectly. My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine. The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought 2 of these headsets (one for me and one for the girlfriend) on recommendation by my Cingular sales guy. It was either the BT250 for $80 or the Moto HS810 for $99.Not knowing too much about Bluetooth headsets at the time, I opted for the BT250. Two weeks later and I'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I'm sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery. I'd really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.Regardless, I have found the BT250 to be a better value than the HS810."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Paired with a nokia 6230. Awesome headset. The battery life is pretty long. It feels really light on your ear and the sound is excellent.Some of these people must be going deaf or something because this thing can get loud. I never have the volume at max when I use this. And if this thing feels heavy on your ear, you must have ears the size of nickels. Or you're using two of them on the same ear...i don't know.Whenever I use this I sometimes forget I have them it until the unit rings... which makes me twitch because I'm not expecting a ring blasting thru my ear.I hate:-wind noise. You can't carry a conversation when you're driving with the windows down. or walking and the wind blowing in your face.-voice dialing may or may not work.-it makes my phone hang and reset. but that could be a phone problem in general.-30 feet? more like 10. 15 at best."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster, and it is not the right antenna. Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it. This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon's problem. I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so, but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception.  Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry.  There is not excuse for this as Amazon has been told many times by Wilson Electronics that they are sending customers the wrong product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This didn't do much for me. Unfortunately, it may not be the blame. Ironically, I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes (I thought). This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution. So in the mobile world, I'm sure this would be helpful. It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage, location, type of usage, cell frequency and more. So in putting a system together, for a whole home solution, you'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn't really as \"standard\" as one might hope!) However, it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn't care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).  The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase, so I don't know why it is proving as fragile as it has.  If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed, it is a good choice.  Otherwise, I suggest looking at other designs."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have had this headset for several months now, and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK, but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect, ie. no background or wind noise, and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off, when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset, I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Works as advertised.  It's a tacky pad that is non-adhesive and keeps stuff from sliding around on the dashboard.  Problem with the iPhone (4S) is that the back is a flat panel of Gorilla Glass and does not lift easily off the Sticky Pad.  Instead, it tends to lift the Sticky Pad off the dashboard by sticking itself to the back of the iPhone.  I'm sure the problem would be solved by using an iPhone cover, but then if I did I wouldn't need the Sticky Pad at all."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I did take off a star in the rating because products like these are marketed in a slightly exaggerated way.There's nothing &#34;sticky&#34; about the product.  The pad is made of a specific material that is able to hold the objects in place while you're driving.  It's not perfect, but for the simple task of holding a cellphone, sunglasses, loose change, perhaps your EZ-Pass, it will do the trick.I place a camcorder there to film road trips, and for the most part, it stays put.  Like any other product of this type, if you off-road, drive over unpaved roads, or you intentionally drive abnormally, the contents of the pad may not stay put.Summary:  Just drive normally, and you won't have a problem."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Like so many other reviewers, I had this Think Outside Stowaway \"collecting dust\" as I had bought it for an older phone.  I was actually looking on Amazon for a foldable keyboard and came across this and these reviews.  So I found my Stowaway (quicker than I thought I might!), did not load the software that came with it (as the instructions tell you to do), but just decided to see if it would sync with my Playbook.  First, of course, I had to put 2 AAA batteries in it and, VOILA, it worked!!!  I am a happy camper!!!  As another reviewer said, it is surprising that some other manufacturer hasn't continued this concept in folding keyboards."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I just love this keyboard. I've used it with my HTC and now with my unlocked iphone using BTstack Keyboard from Cydia. The only issue is that it really needs an extra row of keys. The numbers and symbols are placed on the top row of letters (where the letters QWERTYUIOP are in the keyboard). To access a number, you need to press the left function key and the corresponding letter. To type a symbol, you need to press the right function key and the corresponding letter. I work in finance and many of my annotations need numbers and symbols, like 10% for example. For that, it takes a long time. I find it easier to type \"ten pc\" instead of 10%.I'll buy a new keyboard just for that. But besides this, the keyboard is just amazing. So if you don't need your numbers and symbols too often, I really recommend it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First off, I have had this product since 2007 and was fortunate to catch it at a great bargain!!  Since then, I have not had one problem with it except when I forget to change the batteries!I have been able to successfully pair and use this keyboard with originally a Samsung I760, then a HTC Touch Pro 2 and now my Motorola Xoom tablet.  I was surprised that I didn't even have to download drivers, it worked once I simply paired it.Not having number dedicated keys was a sacrifice but I can type memos, emails or simply work on a novel at anytime conveniently by having this portable keyboard.  The keyboard itself is very durable and has a sturdy feel when you are typing."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this product to send over to my wife who is on a trip, and complained about typing on a Blackberry. I thought I better install it before sending it after her, so I could guide her along. No PC where she is, so I tried to download as advertised. Result: Page Not Found.Company advised that since this is a discontinued item (?) they took down the support pages.This would not be an issue normally - you can install the driver from a PC.It is the principle that a company can maintain a manufacturer's description while not the web page to support the claim...You know a manufacturer is a scumbag when their feedback/survey link gives you an error message back...If any doubts read the blackberry link from the bottom of the review page, or click on the one star reviews. A shame"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Great sturdy design in every aspect. After pairing, it features flawless instant connection to your device every time you open it. A keeper for long, its quality shows it'll last for ages.I just wish iGO would start working on supporting Windows Mobile 6. It does perform as a keyboard should and it does carry out it's core functionality; but, I can't find the drivers for my device or any other WM6 device for that manner. I am currently using similar ones which, though do allow the device to work, don't allow all function keys to carry their purpose or softkey support to be accurate."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Works great with my Moto Q.  Typing sound is annoying but easily turned off.I also caution that you should probably store the batteries uninstalled.  I put a brand new set of Duracells in it and they were dead a month later with almost no use (Just sitting in my briefcase)  I discovered this at the start of a 5 hour flight and fortunately was able to cannibalize a set from my MP3 player.  This only happened once so I can't say for sure that the keyboard sucked them dry.What really annoyed me was the \"Fold and unfold\" sticker which had some sort of industrial adhesive.  What a stupid thing to use.  It took me 25 minutes with cleaning solvent to get that darn thing off.  Also the black vinyl zippered pouch stinks like some toxic chemical.  If not for those two things I'd rate it 5 stars"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Long battery life, connects quickly to phone. Phone callers can't even tell I am on a BT headset, no complaints of inablility to hear my voice will on a call. It is not for people with wide necks, does not stretch much. Can slide back when active and the earphones are not in your ears. Otherwise light, controls are easy to reach and distiguish. I have the similar LG HBS730 but prefer these due to the ease of finding the buttons you want but prefer the flexible neck of the LGs."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought these to replace my LG headset which kept dropping audio during phone calls.  The sound quality is very good.  It has a longer range than the LG. Overall very pleased.  The software that runs the headset is not as advanced as the LG, it doesn't announce the battery level and it can only be connected to one device at a time.  When it announces it is connected, if two of your devices have bluetooth on at the same time, you don't know which one it is connected to because it does not identify the unit it is connected to.Overall, though, I like them a lot.  The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's so so.  Not as comfortable as advertised and hugs your neck which i hate.  Has great sound but  is quite plain. I own an older LG model bigger for guys my size.... Has more control buttons for the different functions compared to the 2 buttons the Motorola has.The off/on button is in a bad place, every time I lay on the bench to lift weights I lay on the button which shuts it off ...Poor design. I wouldn't say not to buy it but a gadget person as myself I prefer the LG so I returned the Motorola and ordered a newer LG model .."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought these after TWO sets of LG Tones broke on me. I like these a lot. Very comparable to the Tones. What was most important to me was battery life. I used these for listening to sports and talk radio. I have wired buds for listening to music. The only two complaints I have with this item is: the neck band is kinda tight in comparison to the Tone. Not as easy to get on and off. However, they don't move around as much as the Tone's. My second complaint: the on/off. I have to take the headset off to access the switch. The Tone's switch is a much better setup and easily accessible. All in all, I would recommend these. I am hoping the quality is better than that of the LG Tone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I just love this bluetooth headset. It was so easy to pair up with my new Sidekick 3. I did not have to do anything except charge the headset and then turn it on. Thanks again Amazon.com for providing me another great product at such a great price. The sound quality is outstanding. People on the other end just know that I am talking on a landline phone until I tell them that I am on a Bluetooth wireless headset and they are astounded. I highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for a brilliant headset at an excellent price. The Motorola HS 820 is the bomb!!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's a great deal, so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar, wish i could return that! But this headset, thinking it's from motorola would work well with my phone, but no. It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird, b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm using mine with the Jabra A210 non-bluetooth phone adapter and it works fine. I've used it in the office on my cellphone (handsfree allows me to type and talk with no wires) I use it in the car and it gives me great movement without wires. Very small clips around the ear and you don't even realize its there. Very pleased with this unit. I charge it overnight and it works all day from 530am till 11pm constantly receiving calls. I've had this for a about a week and I'll leave it on this weekend to see just how long it will last before running out of gas. I'm pleased with the quality of the Microphone and Earpiece. Can't believe just how well the mic works. I can shout and whisper and the volume is constant. This is my first bluetooth earpiece and I'm happy with it ! Some calls have slight distortion, but since other calls are crystal clear, I have to believe its the cellphone connection and not the earpiece."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised.  I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume.  Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise.  I found it only adequate in a quiet room.  I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal.  I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car.  It is fine if your sitting in quiet room."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset seems to work fine, but the audio quality is nothing to write home about, to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone. They will also hear a lot of background noise. I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset. It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And, you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires, which feels a bit safer and freer, especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this to connect walkman type gadgets to my car stereo.  It worked well at first, but the wiring quickly started having problems.  The sound would cut out and I'd need to mess with the cable to find a position where the wires inside would be touching correctly again.  After 8 months, the wire is now completely detached from one of the plug ends.  Maybe the heat of my car played a role in the breakdown of the cable, but if that's how you're planning on use it, don't be surprised if it starts shorting out on you too."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitz,bells and whistles, and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price.  But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced, as well.  I could not get a comfortable fit.  My ear is well within normal range of size and shape, but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive, wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort, or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear, you may be happy with this headset.  I wasn't, and am returning it.  I'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try;  if it's no good, I'll probably go with a Jabra, and spend a bit more money."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have been using this for a month.PROS:It is a good value.  It works really well, and it lasts a very long time on a charge.  The WindStop feature works very well.  People have been able to hear me very well while driving and even while playing volleyball.  It stays on the ear well but is not uncomfortable.CONS:The unit looks okay but is less attractive than some of the other high-tech units on the market.  3 of my co-workers have commented that it looks like I am wearing a phallic symbol on my ear, which is really not the look I would like to achieve."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "There isn't much to say here.  For the phone system I have, this was needed to enable the remote functions of the  Plantronics-CS540 Convertible Wireless Headset.  It could be more aesthetically-pleasing, but as I'm sure it's designed for a wide variety of phones that need a remote lifter, I suppose you can't complain.Mounting the unit can be tricky.  You need to be certain it will work properly before you use the sticky tape to mount it in place.  So, you wind up holding it with one hand while working your headset to activate/deactivate it several times to be sure you've found the right spot for it.Comes with a special headset adapter for phones with shapes that offset the lifter bar."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I used this phone lifter in combination with the Plantronics CS50 Wireless Office Headset.  It was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to 300 feet away from my office. This lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset.  You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing.  The setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone.I spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day.  This is a useful tool in any modern office and I recommend it to you."}

First, the fit on my particular ear is horrible... always feeling like it was going to fall off. I never trusted it walking through airports as it just didn't feel secure.Second, the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months. The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose, then broke off. I note that others have metioned the same thing. It just wasn't well constructed. Bummer!

Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well, not too bad really).It was an easy setup.  The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why not 3 stars?  The volume control is hardly palpable.  It is hard to adjust the volume while in use.  Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust.  Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear.  It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear."}

After using a nokia bluetooth for the last year I got this one again because of the no cell phone laws in California as of July 1st.This headset is plenty loud with my Sony Ericsson T650i and I haven't had it drop the bluetooth connection yet. The volume sits a little below half and I can hear perfectly in the car. Battery life rocks and voice clarity is a lot better than I remembered it with the first H500.4 out of 5 stars because the ear clip is flimsy and doesn't allow the H500 to sit tightly against your ear. So if you're planning on using this while running or during an intense walk - don't count on it.Definitely recommend this as a great bluetooth device. Can't go wrong with the price!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This Bluetooth sucks. Plain and simple... I mean I paid, what, $15 for the thing so wasn't expecting the best but at least working quality. I always buy the Motorola H730 or H750 which are upwards of $60 but I always lose them. Always! It is a curse so I figured I would get a rinky-dink cheap one so I wouldn't cry in the corner losing out on a day&#8217;s worth of work pissed and distraught over losing my (what is this my 6th) Bluetooth. But with every call - EVERY ONE - it was unbearable static on my end so much so that everyone mentioned it. Hell, even the recorded lady on the voicemail was like this thing sucks!

It paired quickly has held a charge for 2.5 days thus far (light-moderate usage).  My opinion is that it does what it should at its price point and I was not expecting a miracle.If you are looking for a BT set that has loads of noise canceling and voice detection..then this is not for you.  Look for a Jawbone by Aliph...The H500 is a model that has been around a long time and is perfect for my needs.  I just wish it were a bit louder and thus I am giving it a 4/5.Great value, great item."}

Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710. To bad, the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me. If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My wife and I each purchased V551s with our migration to Cingular 6 months ago. In that time (during which the phone was never dropped, bumped, etc), I've replaced my phone twice, and hers once. The problems we've had include:- random \"white screen of death\"- Bluetooth connectivity problems (isolated to phones)- dropped calls in perfect reception areas- random battery indications- the infamous \"Unable to Charge\" problemAdd to that Motorola's lousy phonebook and UI, and retarded Bluetooth handling (e.g., if any BT device is connected, the same Moto default ring sounds, regardless of sound profile or caller-specific ringtones), and you have an overpriced, overhyped, oversize paperweight.I'm fortunate Cingular offers my company's employees discounts on new phones, so that I can go back to Sony Ericsson. My old T616 gave me 2 years of perfect service, even after having been dropped twice. It's on its 2nd owner now, who has used it for 6 months problem-free."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The only downside with this headset is that the first one I owned broke after about 2 years of use. First the ear \"hook\" piece broke off. Then the 2.5mm jack broke while in a plug - I'm only glad it was in an adapter and not my phone at the time or it would have ruined the phone.I bought another one and it works fine. Hopefully that broken 2.5mm jack was a one-time thing. Otherwise the sound quality and fit are great. The reviewer who says the ear piece is too snug should use a smaller ear piece - there are 3 different sizes that come with the headset for each ear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's shiny which is pretty but that makes it a fingerprint magnet. Its just okay. I buy a lot of cases for my phones because I like to switch them out a lot. This one is nice for the times when you want a dressier case. For everyday I think I will stick with real leather cases from Zenus. They cost a lot more but they they wear well too IF you buy their real leather cases. The case cover creases if you accidentally run your fingernail along it. It's permanent crease. Its bulky so it protects but makes the phone too big. I used to love BoxWave, but this one is a little disappointing.  Why buy a cheap case for your $650 phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I actually like this case a lot. I was worried about the price and it being a TPU and all. I have to say, I have a feeling this one is going to last a lot longer than the Spigen Neo-Hybrid I owned for 3 months before it broke. And even better, I can fit all of my charging and headphone devices perfectly, unlike the Spigen. It doesn't make the case bulky, as it may look. It actually feels quite nice in my hands. Overall, I really like this case. If that happens to change eventually, I will absolutely re-review it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have bought many cases for many different cellphones and this is the first case that compelled me to write a review.  This is by far, THE best case I have ever had.  It fits so perfectly, you'd think that it was meant to be a second skin for the phone.  and the fact that it doesn't add a lot of bulk, but feels like it will protect very well makes it that much better.  This case is worth more than double or triple the price.  I wish they made this exact case for every phone.  It would be my go-to case.  Please make one for the HTC ONE!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Does what it needs to do at an excellent price.  Fits well, seems rigid enough to prevent some damage, and the kickstand is a nice touch.  I don't know how well the kickstand will hold up over time, but works well.  The ridge around the front allows me to put the phone face down without it touching a table.  The case is pretty compact and still fits into the Smart Dock, although it prevents HDMI from registering.  So it charges and goes into dock mode, but doesn't seem to sit down far enough to engage the HDMI."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone. However it did interfere with my cellular signal and brought my bars down from 3 to 1 and sometimes none. I started dropping calls and the people on the other line said I was fading in and out when I was able to talk to someone. I took the cover off my Note 2 and my bars popped back up to 3 and I had no problems with phone calls anymore. I tried it again to make sure it was the cover, and sure enough it did the same thing as before. I had my partner try it as he has the same kind of phone and it did the same thing to his Note 2. So I had to return the case for a refund. It is disappointing because it was a great looking case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The case took almost a week to arrive. You buy a cheap case, you're going to get cheap case quality. Stay away. The inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all. Will scratch your phone. Looks as if someone dropped it in dirt. Could not clean whatever gunk was on the case. Thank God it didn't scratch the aluminium on the case. A credit card didn't even slide all the way down into the case. Good luck trying to fit two in there. Spend your money else where."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this charger to use with my Motorola Razr.  I already had one that is essentially identical, except my old phone (Motorola V5510 has a different sytle adapter than the Razr, which uses a 'mini-USB'.This product is inexpensive, does exactly what it says, which is charges the phone in a car using the auto's power/cigarette outlet, and it comes with a cute little Motorola 'M' insignia which lights up bloue during use.  At such a low price - I paid less than $9 on AMAZON - there's really no reason to buy a non-OEM charger."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the original Motorola car charger and is the only one you should consider. It works well and seems to have good protection so that you can start your car with it plugged in without frying your phone or the charger itself.The Motorola logo on the end of it lights up when it's plugged in, which looks very cool especially at night. I was pleasantly surprised by this as well as the performance and build quaility.I can't vouch for the company shipping it out promptly since mine was included as part of my RAZR phone bundle but I would recommend this charger to anyone with a RAZR or PBLE phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought one of these and the second time I plugged it in the light on the end went out and it stopped working! This thing is junk, there is no way to replace the fuse (if there is one) without destroying it. I tried to take it apart, but you can't without breaking it. If this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design. Now do I break it open and hope I can get it back together or toss it??? I have NEVER had a problem with a car charger in the 10+ years I have owned a cell phone, that should tell you something! How do you screw one up?! You hire the idiot who designed this one thats how!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the 8th headset I have tried. Most of the ones I have purchased work very well with a cell phone, but not so good on a cordless phone. Same with this set... Very comfortable to wear. I can hear those I call really well. Those that I call need to be able to hear me too! The volume on this mic is better than most I have tried, but is still low. If you are talking to clients on the phone all day, this is important. I have a good Panasonic cordless phone and have yet to find a headset to use with it that has a strong volume. Still looking."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Sound quality is pretty good.  The wind \"technology\" is not bad.  Stong winds, blowing sand etc,  is going to get heard with this.  But for the price it is comfortable.  For someone who has to buy special adapters to get Blue tooth devices to stay in my ear I am impressed with this.  I wish it had a call end button on the thing.  But the mute button is great.  I would buy this again.  And i like it almost as much as my jawbone.  Paring is not an issue with wired devices.....  ;)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "OMG this has got to be the smallest piece of junk I have ever paid for :) really this charger died 2 weeks after I pluged it into my car.the charger itself is made of cheap plastic,light weight and just down right worthless. the 2 weeks I had it pluged in,it never gave my phone a full charge,i drove 63 miles with it pluged into my phone and yet still did not fully charge it.guess you get what you pay for.so if you want more,then you'll have to pay more."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this for my father who uses a Nexus 4. The case looks and feels really nice and generally works well. However, there is one significant problem - the inside leather leaves an oily residue on the phone when closed. Suede and leather do need to have some oil retained to keep them in good condition, and while this makes the material look and feel wonderful to the touch, it is a bit of a problem when it comes to these kinds of electronics. The genuine leather on the outside is nice, but I think a synthetic inner lining may be more appropriate for this type of thing."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love the case and it came 2 days early but there is some gripes i have. first of all there is a strong chemical smell as if the case was just freshly stained and second I had to remove the back of my galaxy s3 phone in order to get it to fit in the new case. and ive had it and been using it for 3-4 hours now and the smell is all through my house. it makes my throat hurt and im coughing so im going to leave the case outside for a couple of days and see if the smell goes away. I hope it does because i really wanted to use that case.I will update in a few days. if anyone has any suggestions on how to make the smell go away please let me know.update: ok i left the case outside for 24 hours and it seems to be ok now. but i still have to remove the back of my phone for it to fit. my phone is the galaxy s3 SGH-I747"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got one for myself and one for my husband.  The sound quality was good on either end, whether I was using it or I was on a landline talking to my husband while he was using it.  He loves it.  I gave mine to a friend.  I have smaller ears so the headset does NOT fit me.  If the ear piece going right into my ear the way it should, the headset rests above the top of the ear and falls off.  If I get it to rest on the top of my ear so it is on securely, the length going to the end of the earpiece is too long and extends below where it is supposed to fit into the ear.  Hubby likes his, back to square one for me.  Those with small ears, you might want to find a different style headset"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the best bluetooth device I've tried.  It is lightweight, comfortable, easy to set-up, good sound clarity and it is a very well made and sturdy device.  There aren't flimsy parts that can break.The best thing is that the ear peace is fairly inconspicuous as it sits over your ear.  I really don't want to look like Janet Jackson in her Control video as I walk around town or the mall.The problem is in finding replacement ear gels.  They are not available on the Jabra site or on any other site.  I ended up back at Cingular (now AT & T) and they gave me a couple that they had in a drawer."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After having replaced my 250 3 times at the verizon store I asked to be given the 250V instead of a 4th 250, they did and so far so good, I think Jabra knew the 250 had some defects , each 250 i had died (stopped pairing) in about 2 months, the 250V seems to have no problems and works much better with my Motorola V710.The fit is great, and the sound is good, could use better noise cancellation, but oh well, maybe in a future model. But overall , I like the 250V. I recommend it to anyone. Just roll your windows up if your driving, or you wont be heard by the other end of your call."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this unit for about a year, it acts as an ear plug on the ear I'm wearing it on, and I can hear my caller even in strong winds. The audio quality is great. Since the microphone sits directly in front of my mouth the caller can hear me just fine and many times they don't know I am in the car. Since it's a wired unit, there are no batteries to charge and it's always ready to go. If you don't mind things in your ear this is a great head set.Update: Moved to an I-Phone from my Palm phone. I had to get a 2.5mm adapter to 3.5, The phone does not see the headset most of the time and won't route calls to it. Same with Blackberry Curve. I hope sure will make a new model for these phones, I miss using it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I drive a convertible and I have gone through 6 different hands-free devices that didn't work. Wind noise is awfully high with the top down, and my wife could never hear me when I talked on a hands-free. That is no longer a problem. The Shure works great! It is comfortable, clear sounding and best of all - I'm audible when I speak. If it had a \"turbo\" button, it would be perfect, but other than that - it is terrific. This is the best I've seen..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The only thing that I can add to the hundreds of reviews already posted here is my own experiences (we ordered 2 of these).Positives:- No earbud going into the ear - this is a BIG positive because I can't stand those and, apparently they are not good for you.- Quick charging.- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry.- Easy to turn on/off, by simply folding/unfolding the microphone boom.- Pretty good instructions.Negatives:- My wife complains that the sound quality is not always perfect.- Being as small as it is, perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.- The charging interface is not a mini-USB but some weird, proprietary plug.- If there is a way to attach this to the left ear, I am not aware of it.At this time, my wife decided to keep hers but she will give the second one to her girlfriend as a birthday present :)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a terrific device.  I use it with my Motorola RAZR V3 and it works great.  I don't know what I did without a wireless headset.  Two things that could be better - first it doesn't recognize ring tones from my phone (but I think that is the phone's problem not necessarily the headset), and second, it occassionally will drop the signal from my phone causing me to scramble to figure out how to go from the headset to my phone.  This doesn't happen very often so it really isn't that big of a deal."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When it comes to headsets, the sound quality is the bottom line for me. I'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it. I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. The fit was a bit loose but not a huge problem. The big issue for me was the muffled sound, both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse. (I also tested the Motorola H700 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one.)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this headset to replace my HS820.  I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.- Insecure attachment to my ear.- Insuffcient volumeWhenever I moved, the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off. They never did but it was still annoying.The volume problem was in part related to this. The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I gave it 2 stars rather than one because of the GREAT battery life.I finally bought a Plantronics 510 and have been very satisfied."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have been very happy with this headset.  I use it with a Motorola RAZR V3.My last Bluetooth headset was a Jabra, and it broke after just a few months -- the power button quit working, so it was always on until the battery drained.I love the HS850 since it has no power button!  Instead, you just flip it open or closed.  It gets great battery life, since it's so easy to put it in standby by flipping it closed.I have also used this headset successfully with Skype on both Windows and Mac.  The only catch is that it can only be active with one device at a time, so you have to disconnect/release it from your cell phone, before you can successfully use it with Windows or Mac.  This makes switching back and forth between your PC and phone a bit cumbersome.  Of course, it took a couple of hours to get it working under Windows, but it worked first try on the Mac ;-)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got two of these.  One for my wife and one for me.  I can not tell when she calls me if she is on the phone or using the headset ( maybe that is more a comment on the phone :) ).The voice interface of the phone has more to do with how well this works.  On my wife's phone she has to train each contact she wants to voice dial.  Not very practical.  On my phone it just figures it out but sometimes I am not certain who it has decided to call.  We both end up dialing through the phone and using the headset to talk and answer calls.  (We both have Verizon WM5 PDA phones.)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I owned the V300 and found it to be a bit quirky, strange things would happen when ever I charged it, when it was finished all the personal settings would revert back to factory standard. They seemed to have fixed that with this latest version of the phone. My understanding is that they have combined the features from both the v300 and the v 600 to make this phone. I've only had it for 1 week and so far so good I always enjoyed functions such as speaker phone, voice dialing and voice memos, now I get the blue tooth and a much better redesigned key pad along with video clip capabilities. All of this is good news! If I had to pick a down side I would have to say that I'm dissapointed that Motorola decided to make this phone look exactly like the v300. I like what the body of the phone feels like, but a change of color would be better, maybe silver."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a very nice phone.  Much nicer than my Razr V3 that I returned 3 times because of the high pitched whining noise... if you can live with high pitched static when answering calls (yes, this only happens when answering... NOT when making an outside call).  I like the color (and toying with changing the face plates) and the functionality with great battery life.  Its camera is pretty descent as far as cell phones go.  It is clear and works.  It is not super fancy, though it has a lot of fuctionality.  I am a bit disappointed that T-Mobile and Motorola don't have more choices right now, as I would have been happy to buy them.  Anyway, if you want a good phone with Bluetooth (BT), then this is a very good one."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Yeah it's a sim card and well my phone doesn't have 3G so I don't really care that it works with 3G because it doesn't matter.I don't know why they want reviews on sim cards. I find SIM cards outdated though, They are massive compared to Micro SD cards and yet they hold next to no information when compared.The only reason SIM cards are good is because they go in GSM phones and if you unlock your phone you can cart it off to another service provider without issue. Especially quad band phones."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Over the years, my household has tried multiple Bluetooth solutions for our hands-free communications needs. We've had acceptable results from a solution integrated into GPS...but much of our regular driving doesn't include the need to load up a full-size GPS. We've had acceptable results from a visor-mounted Bluetooth speaker unit, but let's face it: sometimes we want to hold conversations that don't include everybody in the car:-)The Plantronics Voyager 510 has proven its value overs more than three years of demanding use. It fits comfortably over your ear excellent incoming and outgoing audio clarity. Best of all is its outstanding ability to hold a charge for a long time. I can generally count on more than a week between charges, even during periods of heavy use.We liked this enough to buy three...one for each driver in the house."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We have tried everything from the moto-850 to the other plantronics and after seeing this in a gold box deal thought what the heck.  To my amazement it has been really a fantastic headset. Easy to pair, easy to adjust volume, great battery life, very clear even with wind noise and city sounds around, and last but not least it has an indicator light that does not look like an emergency strobe (I hated my mot-850 for that at night it would reflect off the glass and the dash in the car or the side window and drive you insane...)All and all a 5 star unit"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset generally works, though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are:1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear, but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it, its hard to get out of your pocket.3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car, I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly. It disturbed my passengers too.4) Wind tolerance - it's better than my H700, but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I'm sending mine back and getting another H700."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The last Bluetooth headset I used was a Motorola something-or-the-other, and frankly I was underwhelmed. A few years later, I tried thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging], and it was amazing. For the most part, people can't tell that I'm on a Bluetooth headset!The Pros: Great audio quality! Good battery life.The cons: I only wish it had a better earpiece... on that really goes INTO my ears, like mySony MDR-XB20EX 9mm High Sensitivity Driver Extra Bass EX Earbuds. The volume and mute buttons are kinda small and hard to reach/press.Those are just small details though. Overall I am impressed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've tried the Motorola ones and either I couldn't hear or the person on the other end couldn't hear (usually both).  I bought this based on a recommendation of a Realtor that swore by it, and to be honest, I have only had occasional trouble with it.  It's comfortable to wear, it's easy to hear, the other person hears me.  I wear it most of the day, on project sites, while driving, even at home.  It works as expected and I'm very pleased with the results.  If you need a bluetooth, this is the one."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my 3rd bluetooth headset and my 2nd Plantronics.Plusses: works really well with my phone, even up to 20' away. I've dropped it lots of times and it's holding up nicely. Easily adjusts to either ear. Turns on & off easily.Negatives: People complain they can't hear me on a regular basis (even when there isn't noise around me). Is awful with wind noise. Is much clunkier than my last Plantronics (330). My phone knows it's there but is often very slow to transfer over to the headset.Overall, I am disappointed with the headset - other than the range between it & the phone, it's is not as good as the Plantronics 330."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've heard great things about this, so I tried it. Everything is great about it, except two things that made me want to return it.First, there is a little bit of crackling once my phone is across my body on my hip, and that is annoying to me because I've had some that never do that. I've noticed that Plantronics and Jabra tend to have this issue regularly with their headsets. The other thing is that it is bulky, and I prefer something a little more pettite.It does have good battery life and noise cancellation. So, it's a matter of preference when it comes to the things I disliked about it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Definitely a much better headset than the other two Motorola models that I also own -- it is loud, clear and the battery lasts a good two days between stand-by and light/medium use. It is a little larger in size but it is light in weight and comfortable for extended wear (3-4 hours at a time).There is one drawback, the unusual power cord/plug. After only 1-2 months of use, the headset started to not charge properly unless the plug is connected to the bottom of the headset just right.***10/2008***I liked it so much, I bought one for my wife. Unfortunately, hers die within 2 months with very light use. And, I mean 'light' -- it spent most of its life sitting on her nightstand. The light indicator went dark (not turned off) and it wasn't picking up her voice when she speaks into it. We returned it for a replacement and this one appears to be working just fine."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Item does work well as far as sound quality and setup ease. However ear loop is basically not adjustable at all, consequently making the ear piece itself to constantly work its way out of my ear and feel as if it were just hanging there... After days of pushing ear piece back into my ear canal and hoping the loop would give a bit. i returned it for exactly those reasons... Great sound quality and no one i spoke to claimed to hear any distortion. just didn't fit well with no possible adjusting available..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The sound quality is tops both at the sending and receiving ends. However, the ear hook is on the thick side. This can be a problem for ears that lie close to the head - the earhook pushes the ear away from the head. First, this does create a rather odd looking mismatched pair of ears! Second, it can become uncomfortable after prolonged use. It also poses a problem when wearing eyeglasses - one temple rests on top of the headset ear hook with the other at ear height. This causes the eyeglasses to rest lop-sided. So, buyer beware. The sound quality is great. The comfort issue could be a problem for you."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had 3 headsets already, and each one had something about it that I didn't like. I hesitated to buy this one, despite the great reviews, because I wanted one that didn't give me the 'telemarketer' look. Top things I was looking for were: sound quality, comfort, and battery life. This unit delivers on all 3 counts. It sounds fantastic, it's really comfortable (especially with the Jabra EarGels on the ear piece), and the battery lasts a long time. Looking back, this is the one that I should have bought in the first place. Recommended."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I admit, I was turned off at first by the size and shape, but was easily won over by the quality of the sound and the comfort. This is as good as bluetooth gets.The downsides are the rediculously small buttons for power and volume, which are almost unusable for most, but fine for me.Today I thought I lost my headset. I found it in a parking lot, ran over at least once, in the rain for at least 12 hours. 10 minutes under a hair drier and it was working again! I will buy another when the time comes."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Plantronics 510 is comfortable to wear for hours and doesn't feel like it will fall off your ear.  It mates easily to my Treo 650 and also to my Bluetooth-enable laptop, which makes it possible to use the laptop for VoIP calls.  Reception is good, volume is adequate and the people I talk with say that my voice is clear.  The controls are a bit stiff, as others have said.  But that means they have good tactile feedback -- you know when you've pressed a button.One marginal shortcoming: the 510's clarity isn't good enough for it to replace the wired Plantronics USB headset I use for dictating to Dragon Systems \"Naturally Speaking\" voice recognition software on the laptop.  But that would be a stretch for any wireless headset.Prices vary widely; shop around."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a great headset but for one thing. The voice call feature on my phone quit working when I upgraded from Windows Mobile 5 to 6. I called the phone manufactor, the cell phone company, and the headset company. None know what to do, only it is incompatable with Mobile 6. Mobile 6 does not use voice tags on selected contacts. It changes voice to digital and looks for what you said. It cannot change the voice from this headset to digital. It works great on answering, not calling with voice. It works great with calls that dial out also.So make sure your headset is compatable to Mobile 6 for voice calling. Of course this assumes that your phone can make voice calls.Again, it works with Mobile 5"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The reviews available on this product from the amazon website really helped me make a great decision.This model may not be the \"latest\" technology but it's enough for me. I only use it in the car because of all the issues that have been raised about driving safety. I feel better with both hands on the wheel, both eyes on the road.I'm not a device geek but this really works for me and the few requirements i have.Simple to use, I set it up in 10 min max.Fits fine, but I do activate the connection before i go down the road because the buttons are small and can be difficult to activate if you already have it behind your ear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been able to carry conversations in my bedroom and bathroom while the phone itself sits in the living room!  The reception has been amazing.  I travel beyond 30 ft in different parts of my apartment and still get clear calls.  My friends can't tell that I'm on a BT headset.  In fact, they say it's clearer than if I were on a wired earpiece.  My problem with dropped calls has plummeted to almost nothing because I now position my phone in a decent area and talk wherever with this Plantronics BT.This is an ugly headset compared to others, but it works!  There's no point in having a cute BT if I can't use it.  I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset is a replacement for a logitec I had used for years.  It is my second bluetooth and the fit is great.  It does not hurt the ear and stays in place very well.The noise canceling is not on par with the logitec, but I added a wind sock and it resolved most of the challenges.The audio is not as good as I would like and the controls are confusing to me.  I think the former because my current phone is a 1.1 and the latter because I am use to the logitec.All in all a good value for the price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "For several years I used a Logitech Bluetooth for my cell phone, and while it worked great, it was always uncomfortable. When it snapped in two, I decided on the Voyager 510! Wow, not only does it work great, but it is VERY, VERY COMFORTABLE! In fact, I can honestly say I actually forget that I am wearing it, something I cannot say about my previous device. So for all of you thinking of a headset, you cannot go wrong with this one! Five stars!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "For a few years I have been with verizon .My last phone was the Motorola e815 .Recently I retired and didn't need all the mins I got on the $39 plan(with taxes came to $44)  pro: I bought the razr v3 on ebay and transfered over to T-Mobile prepaid.the phone works just great and through my Parrot 3200ls handsfree sounds just great.con:When I went to program speed dialing .Boy was I disappointed .First it would only allow 20 voice tags .Then I had to record each individual tag for voice recognition My e815 allowed me to use unlimited voicetags and I didn't have to record my voice on each number,anyones voice would work using any name in my phone book .The Razr is supposed to be an improvement ,which it's not .The Motorola e815 was the best phone I ever owned ,and now Motorola screwed it up .Whats the point of using bluetooth handsfree dialing when you have to scroll down to a name to dial,taking your hands off the wheel  .Wake up Motorola ,Thats stupid ."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I thought to come write this review because it is the 2 year anniversary of me buying this phone. I have never had any protective cover or case on it and it is still not very scratched up and it works as perfectly as when I got it. I had to replace the battery at 18 months but it cost $10 with shipping online for a genuine Motorola battery. Every other cell phone I have had has broken in some way long before 2 years. I'm amazed it is still in such great cosmetic and mechanical shape. No reason for me to get a new phone anytime soon."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my fourth consecutive Motorola phone. I've owned a Timeport, v66, and v600. The Timeport was simply terrible. The v66 was a little better, but the Motorola menu had to be the worst of any phone I had ever used. My v600 was a very pleasant surprise. My sleek and functional RAZR is the best phone that I have owned. I really like the large crisp screen. The tiny external screen is a great addition. After three weeks of fairly heavy use, I haven't had any problems. The RAZR has pretty good talk time, but I'm not certain whether or not one can really get the 7 hours claimed by Motorola. The feature that I really like and appreciate is the abilit to charge my phone with a standard USB cable. It's nice not having to carry around an extra charger when I'm already lugging around my laptop and its power supply."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Plug this in. Sometimes it connects; sometimes it doesn't.I hear callers just fine, but they ask if I am in the bathroom when I wear this.If I leave it plugged into the earphone jack of my phone, it somehow manages to turn my phone off after a few minutes of non-use.I would send it back, but my total cost was only $3.My phone is an older Motorola v365, and I'm sticking with to my BluetoothPlantronics 510 [Retail Packaging]. Maybe this can be an emergency backup."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Bottom line: can't use because the volume of my voice is too low for people to easily hear.  Bought off of ebay after my c200 cord was cut.  The c200 worked well, but this c250 with the longer \"boom\" mic extension was not as loud.  Jabra headsets are very comfortable and easy to wear all day.  Reasonably easy to put on with one hand once you get the hang of it.  I am not sure if my problem was unusual, but these corded headsets seem to be hit or miss.  I have had other brands where the sound quality is not very good or too low.I will just reorder another c200 and take my chances with that."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had the worry that the headset would not work with my SamsungT619, since the latter is not on the compatibility list. On the other hand, I've heard that all bluetooth devices with same standard (i.e. version 1.2) should have no compatibility problem. It turned out to be absolutely smooth when connecting to my Samsung. The headset can flash and even vibrate when call's coming.The headset is amazingly light weight. You can't even imagine a lithium battery is sitting in such a leather-weight body that can hold on for 7 hours' talking.I spent $10 on this headset and couldn't be more happy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am using the Jabra BT350 with a Sony Ericsson K750i.  This works like a charm.  It took a while to set up (problems with resetting my phone), but once I synced the two devices, I have not had any problems.  The sound quality is superb, and the functions are outstanding.  They include vibrating alert (I've turned it off), call accept and call decline (much needed).  It also allows you the opportunity to automatically call the last number dialed. The voice dialing also works great.  I was not able to record the name through the BT350, but once recorded, the phone recognized the name when spoken through the BT350.  An addition, the battery life is great.  I have not had to recharge it in a while.  All and all, this is a great choice for a \"handsfree\" set to be used with a mobile phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset fits so comfortably on my ear and I especially like that I can use either ear. I can hear so much better with the Jabra than the expensive Motorola headset I had that was always falling off my ear.  In fact I was using the Motorola talking with my son, in a lot of pain and needing help.  When I turned my head, it fell off and out of reach.  My son called an ambulance when he could no longer hear me. My elderly Mom says she can hear me better on this headset too.Spring 2007 and this item stopped working.  I'm irritated that it didn't last longer."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I personally think the Black Edition RAZR phone looks really cool, better than the regular silver version.  The phone is otherwise identical to its silver twin... but, really, it just looks so cool -- and you'll differentiate yourself from The Crowd.The phone is very capable and packed with features.  Unlike some high-end Moto phones from a year or two back, this one works very well and has a decent interface.  Everyone I know who has this phone simply loves it.[...]"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am one to always have and use a lot of features. I like the Razr and would recommend it. Positives: light weight, small size, speaker phone works well, display is easy to see, voice dial is accurate, bluetooth, and it is great conversation piece. Negatives: Speakers (normal and speaker) not as clear sounding as my Nokia 6600, no IR port, has a USB port but not software to use it - even for charging the phone, battery life a little short, video recording time way too short, difficult to find a name in the address book (a lot of keystrokes!)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I wanted to keep my car free and clear of cables so I purchased a retractable cable to at least keep it more organized. The retractable part works fine but the cable is pretty thin. I hooked it up to my stereo and I could here a lot of static. I then tried a not retractable cable that was pretty thick and the static was gone and the sound was a lot better. You have to sacrifice sound for clutter free cables or go with sound and have wires all over. I stopped using this since I couldn't stand the static. I am not sure if its the cable I got or not but I will stick to the non retractable cable. I'll just have to find a short one since the 3 foot one I have is too long."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This retractable cable is perfect for connecting ipods, phones, mp3 players, etc to the AUX input on a car. My middle console in the car tends to get super cluttered, so to have a cable which doesn't get tied into knots and make a mess is a huge plus.The sound quality so far as I can discern is great with this cable.The retractor mechanism can tend to get stuck, but has always quickly snapped back into place after I jiggle it for a second.The cable is only 3 feet long, which is perfect for me, but depending on where your AUX input is may not be sufficient, so be aware of what you are buying."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been using mine for over 4 years and it's finally starting to show some wear with the wraparound earpiece, and having a few issues with it shutting off unexpectedly.  All in all, for having it over four years, it's a great purchase.  Although I'm still using mine daily, I'm ready to purchase a new one, and one with a battery is the best, as I simply carry AAA batteries in my car, so whenever this one dies, I just put a new one in on the go.  No worrying about bringing it into the house to charge, forgetting to take it back out, or losing the charging cord.  I love it because it's so convenient and can leave it in the car 100% of the time, so it's always for sure there."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I recently bought a new cell phone (Sony Ericsson Z520a) with Bluetooth. I spent a few days researching the various headsets out there, and soon discovered that only a handful appeared to be worth buying -- and all were between $100 and $150, which I did not want to spend. I came across these by accident, and couldn't find any of the negative comments common with headsets in this price range. Granted they're only Bluetooth v1.2, but they're light, have a built-in rechargable battery, are quite comfortable to wear, and have very good sound quality. In addition, the pairing process is quite simple.If your priorities are quality sound, comfort, built-in battery, and reasonable price, these will be hard to beat. I like it so much I bought a second one for my wife."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I paired it with my computer and cell phone at the same time, both for accepting audio streams. Pairing needs some trail but finally I can bond them. The pairing and re-pairing to my phone maybe because I have a ZN5.The quality and ease of use is very good. However, I have to get use to its behind of neck design. It is also a bit heavy and painful if you don't wear it correctly. The problem is that if you don't use it for a while, you have to take it off, or the narrow collar will squeeze the neck very uncomfortably.Recommended for ease of use, sound quality."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Durable.  Sounds great.  Mic provides good sound for those on the other endof the connection.  I like the wrap-around fit (walkman-style headphones look dorky - wrap around is better).  Although.. after 30 minutes the tips of my ears can become sore which I am learning to cope with.  I use it with Motorola L2 cell phone and Anycom 250 USB dongle for Skype.  This is the one to get.  I had a competing Plantronics product -- in fact two of them -- but they both broke in the same place due to the use of plastic in high-stress areas.  The Motorola design is much smarter."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the best headset for truckers. The back ground noise can not be heard from caller. The ear pices is just the right volume. the Mice takes some use to it. When you talk, you talk in a normal voice. and don't have to speak up to be heard. If you put the mice at your mouth, it will distort the sound. The best place just below your lower lip. The paring has to be done every time to turn the headset on. Will not automatic paring at turn on. Good thing its easy do to.The charge time is great and really holds the charge in stand-by and talk time. the only thing I don't like its heavy and sometimes the mice gets caught on the shoulder strap, when looking side to side."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Amanda Richards hit the nail on the head, but she didn't get into how nice the Bluetooth is on this phone.  In addition to being a VERY SOLID (both in build and function) phone with a lot of features you wouldn't expect to find in something this low in price, you'll also get FULL Bluetooth 1.2 capability.What does this mean?Well, you can transfer mp3 ringtones to it, you can connect a headset to it, you can transfer themes and photos to and from it and you can even tether it to your laptop to use as a modem!If you want a fancy phone, you'll have to pay for it.  But, if you want a decent phone that has an awesome battery life, a sharp, colorful screen, Bluetooth that works and custom themes, then you can't do better than this!I like this phone and use it often as a backup phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm on my third z520a in the six months I've owned it.  The only reason I haven't gone through more is that I've accepted this phone is a lemon.  The phone freezes and can't be shut off, requiring removal of the battery to reset, frequently drops calls, doesn't always let me place calls, and just plain does weird things that result in an unreliable and frustrating call experience.  What is even more annoying is that I purchased expensive, model-specific accessories that will become useless paperweights when I replace this with a new phone - a phone I will be out additional hundreds on, not to mention the cost of accessories.  I'll never buy another Sony Ericsson product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I use in an old-school minivan, with a deep dashboard, and my phone is a Galaxy II (I know, I'll update it soon!)Pros:1- Sticks well on window.  I've used on all kinds of roads (and switched to 3 different cars), always works great.2- Easily adjustable.  Quickly adjusts to whatever angle, whether flexing the arm or turning sideways/straight up.  The ability of the tabs on the side to fold in are the best design of the 3 I've had.  The others maintained a fixed holder on the bottom, which affected how it held when I turned it sideways.3- Wow, I love the grip design.  It allows each arm to slide left/right.  So, I can keep the bottom ones tighter to avoid pressure on my volume buttons while sliding one of the top ones to avoid pressure on my action button.I haven't found a con yet.Good luck!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Great idea and design, not great execution and materials.It works good, but once mounted, almost impossible to adjust-out the sides with the ratcheting mechanism. You sort of have to tilt it backwards to make the ratchet action work. When mounted, you can't tilt it, so it's a real hassle to open.I have mine set, and I just wedge the phone into it when I want to use it.I primarily use it when driving through New York city, to use my phone as a dash-cam. Eventually I'd like to get video of the people that walk into my car or cyclists that ride into it... It's great for that.It's obvious the plastic or construction material allows it to fall out of tolerance, which means the ratchet action ceases to function. It's a crapshoot when you build a complex mechanism out of parts that break or wear easy, or aren't built to spec in the first place."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We bought the Plantronics CS-55 Wireless Headset over three years ago for use in our small business and it was one of the best purchases we have made. My wife asked me to get her wireless headset that she \"wouldn't have to mess with\" so I selected this one since it is what my company uses (a Fortune 500) in it's call centers. Here are my observations:+ Good Range; the unit covers all of our fairly large shop+ Easy to Setup; just follow the simple instructions and go+ Easy to Use; simple as picking up the phone and turning on the headset (we addedPlantronics HL10 Handset Lifterto make it even easier)+ Great Sound Quality; we never had any static issues, even in our heavily wireless environment- Heavy; not absurdly so, but takes some getting used toThis headset gets used just about everyday that our shop is open and it has never given us any problems. It has passed the test of time with flying colors!Highly Recommended!CFH"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We finally tried the Plantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headset and it is AWESOME!  We were using Plantronics CS50 headsets and they just give off feeback and crackle.The Plantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headset is really great, good sound quality, no feedback, no buzzing in your ear!  And people can actually hear you!We have 7 wireless headsets working in our office and 2 are the CS-55.  Once the CS50 ones break (which will be soon) I will be replacing them all with the CS-55!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First, the White Screen of Death Issue.  I had 3 units til instead of returning tp Cingular.  I sent it back to SONY.  NO more problems.  They flashed it with the latest firmware and it works fine.  The WOD will seem to occur after you disconnect after a file transfer.  However, wait 20 seconds and the phone reboots.Pro: Loud and easy to hear from.Con:  Buttons and keypad is hard to get use to.Pro:  The camera is fine for a phone cam.Con: Battery drain is bad, when you play the MP3 player."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This phone has grown on me.  At first I wasn't sure I needed all this stuff, it felt a bit heavy, I was unsure of the swivel design, and I felt guilty for buying such an expensive phone.  But now I know I'd buy it again.  It's still a little heavy (compared to the Razr, which was my other choice) but the reception is great, it has lots of functions, and the interface is easy to navigate.  Best of all, the speaker phone function is one of the best I've ever heard.  It's loud and clear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Galaxy S3 is a great phone, but its finish is very slippery, and the phone is too easy to drop. This case solves that problem inexpensively, and without adding a lot of bulk. The volume and power keys are harder to operate than without the case, though. That's a good thing for the power button, as it prevents accidental power-ons. It's not as good for the volume control, though. But it's well worth the price.Note that in order to get the holes to line up right, I had to put the volume control side of the phone in the case first, then stretch the case over the power button side of the phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this for my wife for christmas and i am disapointed in the voice quality.  When she is in the car talking to me on it I can barely hear her because of the car noise and even with her having the radio on low it is still annoying to hear everything in the background.  For the almost $50 price tag i thought it would be better quality since it was the step up from the entry level bluetooth.  I also havent found how to put it on the left ear yet, i feel like i am going to break it if i try to pull the ear loop off.I would recommend spending another $40 and buying the Jawbone bluetooth.  I got one as a present and it works great and fits better on my ear.  I drastically reduces background noise.Overall, I am not impressed by motorola and thought they would make a better bluetooth for this price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Well, it's a good little bluetooth for the money.. I've only had a couple times when it's cut out on me and not worked right, but 3/4 of the time it works beautifully and people don't even know I'm on it! I think the times that I did cut out was because I was too close to metallic objects.. pipes and things.. so.. that sounds like a good excuse..eh?Works good for me, and is cute and small, fits like a dream, good battery life.. all in all is a good bluetooth."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this bluetooth as a gift for a family member's Sony Ericsson cell phone.  We had to play around with it at first to get it working properly.  She still has minor issues with the headset, but overall she likes it.We decided not to return the headset because I did pair it with my iPhone 3G, after three attempts, without using the passcode.  I was able to use most features easily, with clear reception.  So the earpiece isn't defective.  The price was to good as well.Buyer beware, and do the research on the pairing capibilities with your electronic device and this bluetooth."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:) The H500 works fine with our LG Shine. Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well, not too bad really).It was an easy setup. The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why 3 stars? The volume control is hardly palpable. It is hard to adjust the volume while in use. Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust. Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear. It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews. I got it from Circuit City, so it's not a 'counterfeit'.  It pairs well with my Moto Q9C, and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it. The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise, and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable.  I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had my H700 for almost a year now, and not until recently did I learn it was a FAKE!  WOAH!  After reading the PDF on this page about how to spot a fake, I quickly learned the one I picked up on eBay was a fake.However, the headset has worked VERY well.  I compared it to a bluespoon AX7 in-ear headset, and I ended up keeping my fake H700.  Overall, it has been a very good copy, although not the real thing.  Very reliable.  However, I am still disappointed that I did not get the real headset.Is there anything I can do about this?"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I read a lot of reviews on a lot of headsets before purchasing this one. I've had it for a month now and so far the performance is just fine. I use it mostly in the car with no problems. People tell me they can hear me just fine. The battery life is good; the lights on the headset are helpful indicators. I like the small lightweight size.My wife tried it out and was pleased with it. So I've purchased a red one for her....she'll get it for Christmas."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had the 850 and thought that it was decent but could be better so I bought the 700. Let me just say that I own the Motorola V330 and from reading the other reviews, it seems that this headset works best with the razr. That being said, it does not work well with the v330. If you move more than 4 feet away from your phone, you get a ton of static. People tell me that I sound muffled when I'm talking to them. My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When it comes to headsets, the sound quality is the bottom line for me. I'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it. I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. I find it easier to use the folding boom to turn it on/off when dropping it in a pocket rather than using a button like on most other models. The big issue for me was the muffled sound, both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse. (I also tested the Motorola HS850 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one.)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I hear lots of static, even before making a call.  I have Motorola H500 too, and that headset has no static with my phone (Verizon LG VX8300).  This H700 has LOTS of static.  Called Motorola tech support, and their best solution is to return and replace it.  As far as usability goes, this a great headset, over the ear is more comfortable than in ear and the fit is perfect - nice and snug.  I'd keep it without any doubt if it wasn't for static noise.  While I hear static, people on the other phone can hear me fine, just as good as when I'm using H500."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this bluetooth headset for two main reasons. First, it uses the same charger as both my Motorola Razr and RIM Blackberry 8700C. Secondly the device easily turns on and off each time you extend the microphone.I've used about 1/2 dozen other bluetooth headsets and this is one of my favorites.Here are my summarized pros and cons:PROS:-Uses the same charger as other Motorola RAZR phones-Open/Close microphone to turn headset on/off-Small, lightweight and easy to put on (one handed eve)CONS:-Only connects to one BT device at a time. I have both a RAZR and Blackberry that I carry with me everywhere. With these two devices I cannot have the H700 connect simultaneously (other Bluetooth products - notably the Plantronics) are able to connect simultaneously to two devices.I recommend this headset, and Amazon has the most competitive pricing available. Easily beating even the discount superstores where I'd seen this for 50% more."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "However I just did not enjoy the size of this behind the ear unit, found it to be too big. It is a little difficult at first learning how to slip this around your ear but after awhile it works out ok. Please note that you do not get to use your selected ring tone, it automaticly (Motorola hand set) defaults to its standard ring while the blue tooth is actively connected. You can turn the ear piece off then power on to answer in order to keep your fav ring tone. All in all it works very well, sound and loundness were very good. However, I just did not like the size of this unit. It is quite bulky.EDITJust picked up a HS850, now that is more to my liking, however I hope there will be no issues of a broken wire in the flip boom as the reviewer above mentioned."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When I got it I was a little scared. It was my 1st bluetooth and it looked like something straight out of Star Trek. You have to be a little careful with the twisting earpiece since it's in a sliding ball inside and can slip out of the groove very easily if you change ears too much(which mine did on day three). The range is not as far as you would like it to be, but boy can it hold a charge. It'll outlast your cellphone battery everytime! And, the fit was pretty comfy behind the ear. The buttons are also very easy to use. Remember to speak up though...people tend to have a problem hearing you as well as you will be hearing them."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love the size, form factor, and usability of this headset.  Incoming sound is good.  Unfortunately, the outgoing sound is a deal breaker.  If there is any background noise, this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice.  The DSP helps a little, but affects the sound quality dramatically (think overcompressed MP3).  I am an attorney and need to talk to clients; I need to sound professional.  Unfortunately, this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic.  I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [...] headset, but so far I have not gotten it to work.  I am willing, though, to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm very happy with my Jabra JX10 headset.  My treo 650 is very finicky but it works pretty well with the Jabra.  The Jabra JX10 is amazingly small and most people can't even tell I'm on a wireless headset (which is really amazing because everybody knows when my wife is on her Plantronics 640).Also, I have a car with a convertible top and I can still hear people fine when using this headset- it's quite loud.P.S.  I upgraded to a Treo 755p in the summer of 2007 and it continued to work great - range and sound quality were even better with the Treo 755p."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was tasked by my office manager to purchase some headsets to make our office calls easier.  I looked at corded headsets, cordless, and a variety of brands, but this unit kept coming up with high praises.The clarity is great, and it has a variety of volume (macro and micro) for both the mic and earpiece.  It works seamlessly with any phone system and has a multitude of connection options.  The range allows us to go to the end of our warehouse to look at stock while talking with the customer.  Not to mention that if I'm not at my desk and the phone rings, I don't have to rush back.  I can use both my hands to look up quotes, and stock while I'm on the phone without craning my neck.  Their are earpieces and over the head options.  Not to mention the battery life lasts all day as long as you plug it in at night.Great product!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The ability to leave my MP3 music (cell phone) in my gym bag and get a serious workout without disruption is worth the price along. Being on call, it's also important that I don't miss any of those important phone calls. Getting interrupted with a voice announcement of who's calling makes it all worthwhile. After the first use I was hooked. All of my weekday workouts are with my bluetooth stereo headset. As for the weekends, I'm back to the Zune, not because I dislike the headphones, because I need to escape from the phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this one 2 years ago, it still work well, battery life is good and I recharge it once a week, it can be charged on car too.Volume can be adjusted easily, I like chat with driving and it is a wonderful earphone.With a cable you can connect to your pc directly and listen to music too.In winter it is so wonderful, as it is a ear protection in a cold and windy morning:-)it is a little bit heavier at beginning, for man it is perfect, my daughters can not wear it without holding it.in one word, it is a good product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had these for a while and liked them.  If I wear them for more than 30 minutes, the top of my ears against my head hurt.  I was willing to put up with that because I liked the wireless aspect, and they sounded good.  The ear cushion is great, it's just the weight pushing the rubber shark fin piece against your ears that hurts after a while.Recently I laid them down at work over the weekend.  I guess I laid them down incorrectly, because they are now misshapen.  Once that happens, you are out of luck.  They will no longer fit against your ears.So they sound great, but no longer fit.  I think the ear pieces are just too heavy and it relies on the plastic head/neck band piece to maintain an exact shape.Anyway, I am disappointed and will not buy this model again."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm using this product past 5 months and its b'ful and awesome sound quality. I didn't found any issue with this product. Easy to configure and connect. It works with my Sony Erricson W580i Walkman phone as well as my laptop. Sound quality and beats are very good. Distortion only if u move your head 90% on left, but ignorable. Its not bulky and fit easily. Its in build mic is good. While playing a music if call comes u can atend it with this headset. It has its own volume adjustment. Overall, a good peace which makes me fully satisfied. I got what i was looking for. no wire hassle now."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased these with minimal expectations and am quite impressed. I have been using these with my cell phone and the sound quality is superb. Also, using these for phone calls is quite convenient. The microphone is great and sound quality is top-notch. Even when music is playing and you get a call it automatically pauses the music for the phone call and then resumes it when the call is finished. Battery life is way longer than I had expected; I have owned these for a couple of months now and have only had to charge them twice. Buttons on the headset are quite convenient as well.  I would say the only downside to these is that they are a tad bulky somewhat resembling earmuffs. Also, depending on your head size these may or may not fit on you; I can fortunately say that they fit me with no discomfort and stay on my head even when at the gym. Great product!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Very good value for the money. Phone is very nice looking, a little elegant and conservative I would say.The metal top gives it a little better look and feeling compared to the previous plain razor V3. I use it heavily for work and even so the battery charge is good for 2 or 3 days. Speakers sound nice for mp3 playing, the camera takes clear pictures and it is full of other little extras, however if you are a fan of advanced features and apps,then think twice.For me and for work this phone is perfect.The only thing that i don't like much is that the volume is not so loud, and if you are talking in a noisy place you may want it a little higher, and also be advised that this offer does not include the little memory card so you have to buy it separately.Delivery was very fast and so far I can say I am happy with this phone.If you want a day to day good looking phone I recommend you to get it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the best phone I ever owned.  Reception is very good, battery life is good, ring is audible, and quality of voice is very good.  Mine already came with ear phone, USB cable, leather case and 256MB memory card.  There are a few things that are not so good: - Need to clean cover frequently (it gets easily smudged); - MP3 sound is not perfect (well this is a phone not a MP3 player); - Once when I switched the GSM card it reverted to Kanji characters and I had a hard time to find the English option ;)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The batteries were exactly as advertised, they were delivered in a normal timeframe, there were no issues or hiccups or drama with the vendor.  It was \"slam, bam, thank you, sirs or madams.\"  Battery life is really subjective as everyone's \"normal\" is different.  But life is definitely restored compared to my original 2 year old battery.  My experience is use of Bluetooth really drains batteries quickly.  But that's a Bluetooth issue that goes away if you don't use Bluetooth.  I have no complaints at all with this product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this headset for about a year now; I use it with a Razr.  It's a fine headset from a technical perspective: the sound is fine, it's easy to pair and use, etc.  I haven't run into any problems using it in a car, or out of doors.However, it's really not very comfortable: the hook that goes over the ear is just a bit too stiff and edgy, I wouldn't want to wear it for a long call (more than 15-20min say).For comfort and performance, consider the Plantronics Voyager 510 (around $50 at Amazon); I've had one of those (now used by my son), and it is excellent.  If you're into new gadgets, check out the Jawbone sets -- I haven't used one, but a colleague swears by the one he's been using for a couple of months."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have a Nokia 6230 and purchased this headset from Compusa recently. Used to have a Nokia HDW-3 but the battery died and unable to find a cheap replacement battery.Pros:The unit is solidly made and easy to setup. The mute function work well, the volume is good (no DSP) and sound quality matches my old Nokia. Unlike a lot of loop headsets, this doesn't seem like it'll break/fall off as I tend to put it in my pocket when unused.Pairs fine with my Mac and you can turn off the blue light if needed. Charger is a small flip-prong type and reasonable at 2 hours to charge. Battery talk time is good although it's unclear what type of battery it has internally. The audio cues are fairly logical.Cons:Not the most comfortable headset I've tried. Prefer the in-ear like the Sony HBH-IV835 but I decided to keep this one instead as DSP might suck."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought the SLVR for my wife and a RAZR for my self. People who want iTunes should buy their phones through a service provider who includes it on the phone. Our unlocked SLVR (apparently produced for use in Europe...it came with European plug and a US adapter)did not come with iTunes. Having read the reviews I expected this. My wife uses her phone primarily for talking and text messaging. The SLVR has worked well for this. The only issue is that some of the shortcuts don't work. The main one missing is the one which you use to lock your keypad so that buttons are not accidently pressed. We get this message saying shortcut not available on this phone. Other than this small annoyance my wife and I really like the phone. We're living in Hungary right now and the SLVR is not sold here, so it's extra cool for others to see. The small, thin form factor is great. I'm almost tempted to get one of these to replace my RAZR!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The case is easy to use and hold securely to my belt or waistband. My phone is easy to put in and get out when I want it out, but remains secure when I don't need it.The only problem I had is with the belt clip.  It came to me with a fine leather covering over the belt clip.  The belt clip is very tight, and the second time I put it on my belt, the leather covering it tore and came off.  It really didn't affect the functioning at all, but I was annoyed that something I just purchased came apart on the second use."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is almost perfect for my Palm Treo 700.  The fit is great.  The leather is soft and of very high quality.  The magnetic closure is the best I've seen, with no alignment required yet very secure.  The one exception is the belt clip.  It takes three men and a dog to get it on or off the belt!  It is so tight that I think you could tear the case getting it on or off unless you pry it off with something like a pen.  I don't know what they were thinking putting such a tight clip on such a great case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The only thing that I can add to the the reviews already posted on this device is my own experiences - we ordered 2 of the 'bulk packaged' bundles which include the headset and the charger.Positives:- No earbud going into the ear - this is a BIG positive because I can't stand those and, apparently they are not good for you.- Quick charging.- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry.- Easy to turn on/off, by simply folding/unfolding the microphone boom.- Pretty good instructions.Negatives:- My wife complains that the sound quality is not always perfect.- Being as small as it is, perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.At this time, my wife decided to keep hers but she will give the second one to her girlfriend as a birthday present :)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "But you wont find a better choice at this time. The on off switch by folding the headset and the easy to push buttons make all the difference in the world.  Don't believe me, then purchase the Jabra or one of the other headsets, place it in your pocket or purse and answer a call from your phone.  Chances are you will have forgotten to turn the unit off and your caller will be live wherever you left your Bluetooth headset within 30 feet.  The H700 folds when you take it off your ear and when it folds, it turns off.  Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After losing my cell phone to a lake while flyfishing i decided it was time to try and avoid that mistake. I LOVE this guy i actually bought another one of these (a larger size). I can pretty much let it sit beside me in the water and it will float and not take on any water. It is the best enclosure for valuables. I took this to a theme park where i knew there would be water rides and it still protected. I also used this on the beach to protect my phone. It kept my phone out of the sandy elements. I recommend this product. Any questions please ask i am always looking for advice so i enjoy giving it when i can as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this product for a dive trip to Fiji. While in Fiji I decided to take a kayak out with my camera inside this 'waterproof' case. The case was sitting between my legs and during the trip out it slid into some water. The water was maybe 2&#34; deep. It didn't even completely submerge the case. Once I was out a ways I wanted to take a picture of the resort. When I lifted the case I knew there was an issue right away when water came pouring out.My camera was ruined on the 2nd day of my 10-day vacation. There is no place to find another camera. I would have been better off putting the camera in my pocket than this case.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is mega study. I bought this because I go kayaking with my dad.The case is big enough to fit my IPhone and IPod in their perfectly (with their protective cases), without them moving around in there.Length wise, for just storing those 2 items it's a bit big, but at the same time its not big enough for me to squeeze my wallet in there as well.Size wise, I would have preferred a little smaller to perfectly fit the phones, or a bit longer to fit something else in there as well.That's my fault though. You can read about the sizes but I never seem to picture it right until I have the product sitting right in front of me.But it gets the job done. I recommend."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have had this phone for almost a year now. I have not had any major issues. Though a little slippery to hold. The bad part about the keyboard is that you have to use two hands for it. I have been reading about people losing their stylus', I haven't had that problem so far. I have added a 2GB mini SD card for my tunes. Although this phone does not like Macs, it is a good windows device which requires occasional reset. A built-in task manager would help."}

I don't know what most people were expecting but i think my expection of the phone is what i expected....Until someone finds the perfect phone that has no problems, have everything you ever wanted, absolutely no issue with it and it does every possible thing, then you let me know but for now this phone is ok/good"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The price I paid for this package was good, but the cost of shipping negated the low price. I had seen lower price from other web retailer, $8 with free shipping. Most advertizements online include just one cable. This phone tool package has two cables, one for mini-USB and one for other non-mimi-USB phones. I guess the extra cable is worth a few dollars. The software does not have much on it, but you need it to manage your phone book on your cell phone and to make your own mp3 ring tones and upload to it. Other phone maker like Samsung, you can download similar utilities for free from their website."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "If you have a child who you want to carry a cell phone, but don't want to pay lots of money for all of the extras (or if you yourself just want a \"basic\" phone), this is a good value for the money.  Large screen displays numbers very clearly.  Sound quality is good.  Battery life is a little short and the phone cannot be used while it is charging (that's a pretty big negative, IMO).  But overall, this is a good starter phone and serves the purpose.  If you just want a dependable phone to carry with you in case of emergencies, this phone fits the bill nicely."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Beware Tracfone. I regret that Amazon won't let me give them 0 stars. We got this phone for my wife's aunt last December. After 1 year of trying to get this working, she still cannot receive calls. She can call out, but no one can call her. Tracfone support is useless (and generally only marginally speaks English). You also cannot manage the phone or minutes on line. You have to call in and give them about 60 digits that the phone shows you to do almost anything. We're letting this one die with over 400 units left on it because it is basically useless. Coverage isn't good either, but who cares if you can't receive calls anyway? There has got to be a better option, because I doubt there are many worse ones."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "While fishing I'd used an identical but &#34;brand name&#34; dry pak that was loaned by a friend. The Kwik Tek is, as I said identical, but a good bit cheaper. Waterproof and mudproof protection for my iPhone that I've used fishing and working outside in damp, muddy conditions. Some padding provides additional protection from drops and bumps. Should float with most devices, especially if you leave some air inside. Except for the camera, phone and apps are fully functional although I prefer to remove it for talking. Lanyard provides a bit of extra security that I haven't yet needed but will when kayaking. Between uses to assure inside is totally dry, it is a good idea to prop open to air or drop in one of those silica packs. Guess you could get some protection from a baggie, but at this low price the Kwik Tek is cheap insurance for your phone and priceless data."}

This makes little difference if you use the windshield suction cup to hold and display your unit. However, if you use the adhesive disc for the dash then the charger cord will likely have to be bent at right angles to make the connection, as its receptacle on the GPS points straight down. This device, when attached to the GPS, allows allows the charger cord to come in from the side, eliminating any acute bending of the cord.Conclusion:A helpful device for all Navigon GPS units; intend for those users who wish to have their unit mounted to the dash. 5 Stars"}

The design is really bad for me as I want to be able to charge it folded.  The right angle adapter is just what I needed and the price was right.  It works pretty well for me, so I am giving it 4 stars.I have to be a little nit-picky, but I actually would have preferred a &#34;left&#34; angle connector -- the right angle works for me, but a connector pointed in the other direction would have worked even better.  Note that the connector exactly matches the picture in the product description so I knew what I was getting ahead of time.  I just wanted to get something that apparently nobody makes.  Anyway, if you need the right angle, then it will be a 5 star review for you."}

I didn't know this when I got it, but if the Garmin is plugged in and not using battery power, it automatically turns on when the car is turned on (that's what I get for not reading the instruction manual, lol).To have a cleaner appearance in the car, I have the mini-usb plugged into the ball mount that is holding the GPS and not plugged into the GPS itself.  Unfortunately, that port is really close to the ball mount which restricts it's movement when plugged in.  With the adapter, it makes the cable less intrusive and makes the GPS free to adjust with the ball mount to nearly any position desired.  In combination with a 1.50 mini-usb cable, probably the cheapest way to keep my Nuvi charged while driving!!"}

{"label": 7, "raw": "I use this transmitter on the back of my tv with my Bluetooth headphones. It works perfectly for my purpose and the battery lasts pretty long, given the size of this thing. It's really small, smaller than a matchbox even. Charges up in about 2 hours and will go for a couple weeks, with an hour or two of use per day. I did have some problems trying to get this thing to pair, it's looks as if there are no buttons, don't worry, it's there. The light is also the button, on the opposite side of the USB charging port, and the audio cable. Once you play with this thing for a little while will make you a pro at it. Then you'll have no problems. I definitely recommend this little transmitter."}

Based on my experience, I am comfortable saying that for the price,  you will be very happy with the Blue Ant."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Very convenient product to have that allows for easy movement from one vehicle to the next.  The speaker quality is good and the ability to shift the microphone to a different angle is a nice touch.

Sometimes if I try to make a call via voice dial, it won't activate the phones voice dial feature like it should when I press the Answer/End button.  Overall the product is a good product, but LG enV buyers beware of the inconsistencies."}

There's about a $150 price difference between these two phones so I'm not sure how they figure these two are comparable but oh well.Cons: the speaker is way too quiet, the proprietary data cable is not included, the clear button is too close to the down arrow, and turning the volume up or down is annoying because it rings. I also have a glitch in my phone where it sometimes rings for no reason after adjusting the volume and the only way to get it to stop is to power off the phone.Pros: looks cool, slide function is fun, easy to use, stays locked, large display, lightweight, and slim.Bottom Line:  Would I buy it?  No."}

Without it, you will have an extremely hard time keeping the headset in your ear.  And, it is so small and light, you may not even realize that it has fallen out.  It will drive you crazy without this piece.  I don't understand why it is not included with the headset - it is that necessary.  I have looked at the more expensive ones.  I see no reason to pay the big bucks.  Get it!"}

It doesn't fit into my ear(s) but sort of hangs over it on that damned cheap earpiece that never held right. Pretty much guaranteed to be a worse distraction while driving than picking up the phone itself: distractingly nonfunctional and some engineer's idea of punking everybody who buys it.This was a replacement for my lost Samsung headset that was a much better product, but gone, darn it. As such, I've relegated THIS absurd farce to a place on a shelf until I can conveniently find a way to extract some measure of revenge on it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this headset on the recommendation of a very picky friend, so I figured it would be great. Wrong. The ear loop is cumbersome to put on, and the ear bud by itself will not stay in my average ear. Worse, you have to place the headset in a recharging box (???? What happened to a simple plug??), meaning that the ear loop needs to come off. A Jabra ear gel fits on the unit . . . but the ear piece needs to come off to recharge. The nail in the coffin is that the ear piece volume is terribly low, necessitating a constant shove of a finger to ensure no aural leakage, even in my ultra-quiet Toyota Sequoia. To be fair, the sound quality was reported to to be very good, but the drawbacks far outweigh the pluses."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Expected a small earphone based on reviews but was still surprised at it's tiny size when first looking at it up close.Medium ear \"hook\" worked for me - suggest playing with this (removing the rubber hook and adjusting it on the ear piece) until getting right fit - the bud goes in ear and added loop of rubber is supposed to counter against the curve in another part of your outer ear - genius design imho and when this thing is in, even jumping up and down or shaking your head or tapping your head (yes tried that too, silly I know...) will not dislodge this.Paired easily with a samsung ach930, sound is great and the other side of the call is also impressed, no complaints of echo or static.Have a plantronics 510 which is good, this wep200 is smaller yet compares in quality to the plantronics."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's 2nd headset I had.  I used to have Moto HS850.  WEP200 is better as far as connection; way to operate it.  Easy to carry it around.  It doesn't solid stay in my ear even I used the largest loop. So I won't always put it in my ear, only when there is a call. The voice is clear in in-door or inside the car with windows up.  Noise cancelling is not as good as HS850.  When I walk on the street in a little windy climate, the other party start complaining the noise.  This is what Samsung needs to find the way to improve it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really like this inexpensive lightweight bluetooth headset!  Works well on my end, but sometimes the person on the other end of the call hears an echo.  Stays in my ear great without the clip that goes around your ear.  It charges up in a protective flip top box, so the headset doesn't have to plug directly into wall charger.  I store my headset in the small charging box and carry it in the small box in my pocket when not in use.  I love it that this was only $18!!!  Can't beat that price!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought the BLT-04 case to use with the Motorola H700 headset.  It fits the headset very nicely, but..  But, the design of the case does not prevent the  multifunction button from being pushed if the case is at all squeezed, even though there is a recess in the case cover you'd think would prevent that.  The result is that I'd often find the pairing light on and the battery close to drained.If you are going to clip the case on a shirt pocket, it might be ok, though even the tension of the elastic of the case is enough to push the headset button.  If the case will be put inside a briefcase or purse, then you should probably reconsider."}

The sliding boom mic made a big difference.The downfall of this model, as other reviewers have also written, is that the rubber tips that hold the headset on your ear break off with time.  I used superglue and prolonged the life of mine for a while, but it was annoying."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had seen reviews by folks who had problems with this unit, but tried it anyway as the price was great.The initial charge took less than the 6 hours stated in the documentation, but I've been using it for a week and haven't needed to recharge it as of yet.The reviewer who recommended using the foam cover was absolutely right.  It eliminates most of the background or wind noise.  The unit stays on my ear reliably.  I use the included ear hook.While the output from the microphone could be a little better, I don't have to speak excessively loudly to use it.The LEDs are needlessly bright, but since I don't see them when the unit is on my ear, this is not a big deal."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had to write in and contradict the review saying you can only use this on your right ear.  the instructions show you how to switch it, and you can even switch the volume control from the bottom to the top, so it is on the top regardless of which ear you use it on. NOTE: if you want a Y splitter for car or home charging for this, you have to use model P000, not the one that comes up on a search, because you need a splitter with 2 mini-USBs (one for your phone, one for the headset). Only had it one day, so can't comment on the other issues."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love this headset for the money! I've been using it for a couple years now and I don't know how I ever lived without it. I have gotten my money's worth a hundred times over. I find it comfortable enough that I forget I'm even wearing it. I have some issues with clarity in a few spots, but if I hold my phone closer to the headset in the fuzzy spots, it's okay... and that's not in a lot of places, just happens once in a while. It's easy to pair with any phone too. I used to have a motorola and recently switched to a Samsung. It paired up with no problem. I recommend this product. It's a great place to start if you're looking for your first bluetooth."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset fit great in my ear, its look is very cool, but a few flaws:1. Volume buttons are not easy to reach once the unit is fitted in your ear.2. Using it in windy conditions may get you in an uncomfortable conversation (hello?... are you there? It feels like you're within a hurricane...), and I don't mean only outdoors, you maybe inside your car with the A/C on and if it's blowing right at your face, you'll get this kind of problem"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After a small amount of screwing around the H500 connected with myNokia N75 without a hitch.  I find that if you firmly place the earloop around the base of the ear and then fold in the receiver in fitsfirmly and doesn't come loose.  I agree that the volume could go higher;however, in a quiet room it is adequate.  I'm told that I'm clearlyheard on the other end of the connection.  This is also in a quiet room.Small and lite.  I think this a rather nifty piece of gear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got this for my International Galaxy note N7000 and it fits great.  I would recommend buying a screen protector with it as well.  It works great to protect your phone and it looks great as well.My phone is white so it makes the case look like a lighter blue, I think it's a really pretty color and I love it.  It's see through so I put some fortunes from fortune cookies to show through on the back for fun.But just be warned that the product picture is of the \"blue\" galaxy note phone, so if you have a white one the case will appear lighter in color."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is made of a firmer material than the silicone cases, which is perfect because it doesn't stretch or get caught when going in or out of a pocket or case.  It hugs the phone tight enough that many people won't know you have a case on it.  At first I thought the case was making button use difficult, but then I took the case off and realized the Galaxy Note buttons are terrible even without a case.  It's not much more difficult with the case on, and you do get used to it.  The textured grip area on the sides is a nice tough as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is ok , but there are certainly better ones out there for cheaper.I ordered this case with high expectation thinking i was going to recieve a brand name product from Boxwave , instead i recieved a generic case with no branding .There are other cases here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing i recieved for less then half the price this one is being sold for.For some reason my comments doesnt get approved im not sure why , just letting you all know my personal experience with this transaction ."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm using this case with the AT&T version of the Note. It gets 5 stars for the high quality/price ratio. The material is soft and flexible, the cut-outs line up ok... not perfect, but they don't cause any functionality issues. I love the textured hand grips on the sides. The hard buttons require a little more pressure to push, but i prefer to have the covered over having them open, but recessed under the case. The s-pen opening is fine with my case, I have no problem getting it out. It does make the Note feel noticeably heavier than the naked phone, but there is a lot of area to cover on the note. It's not a perfect case, but I've paid $30 on cases for other \"iDevices\" that had similar issues. Boxwave shipped pretty quickly, but there was no tracking available."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Pros:  Works as it should. Easy connection to the phone.  Good talk time. Comfortable fit on the ear.  Easy to use.One Con: I could use this headset without any problems. My wife would get bad echo issues where the person she was talking with heard themselves as an echo.  Guess it has to do with the fit to the ear.  In my case the path from the earpiece to the mike was blocked but open in her case.  She had the same issue with a Motorola H500 earpiece and i can use the same Motorola earpiece fine.Purchased a Plantronics 510 which works for her.  No reports of echo from the person she is talking with."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my 4th bluetooth headset, and it is by far the best working headset. It is clear. I can hear while driving, people can hear me like I am talking into the phone.My one complaint is that it doesn't fit well on my ear. If they had made the ear loop another 1/4\" I would be giving this 5 stars. Instead it never feels exactly right, and ends up hurting my ear if I wear it for extended periods.I'm keeping it, but I am looking for a different way to attach it to my ear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's a fairly good headset. Negatives: does a poor job of screening out wind noise & other noises; when I make a 2nd call, it doesn't always find the phone & I have to punch a few buttons to get it working again.Positives: very comfortable - I forget I have it on; fairly discreet looking; battery life is very good; hooks up to my phone (Treo 700p) seamlessly - I very rarely have to pair it up again; I can hear very well, even in my noisy diesel pickup!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I like this bluetooth mainly because of the fit.  I find it stays comfortably in your ear and doesn't easily fall off.  I previously bought a Motorola blue tooth and dropped it about 5 days after I got it, I could no longer get a connection to my phone and pretty much threw it out.  I have dropped this about 2 times already and it still works fine.  I like that you can easily rotate to put on your other ear because I cannot handle something in my ear for too long. The sound quality is not perfect but I think it is great for the price. I bought one for each of my family members."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Picked this up when it was on sale and I must admit that it works great. Fits well and stays put. Sound is crisp. I've received no complaints from people on the other end of the call. The battery holds up well. And it's easy to use. Used with an iPhone and Blackberry with no issues.Update: This headset has lastest quite a while with a lot of use. I sit on daily conferences, and this is always in my ear during the conferences. It's comfortable and lightweight. The sound is still great (on both ends). And no issues with durability!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Explorer 350 is simple to set up and use.  Here's my lowdown:Positive:- easy set up and use- good sound- balances well on the ear and easy to put on- nice options charging in car or via a USB port- nice options for mounting it in the car- nice phone ringing tone in the earpieceNegatives:- no built-in mute function (that I can find)- if you want to recharge via outlet, you have to purchase a chargerThis is my second Plantronics bluetooth headset.  The first (Voyager) had all the bells as whistles, but the buttons were very small and the volume button broke when I dropped it on a tile floor.  This one is easier to adjust on the fly but you have to be willing to live with no mute."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have never been up with technology.  My friend always had music on his phone and was listening to it all the time.  I wanted to do the same.  Going into this not sure I came out very pleased.  I have a M520 phone and I listen to music all the time now.  It has loud speakers and eliminates background noises.  I haven't quite figured out how to answer the calls because when I hit the button on he headphones my phone freezes up.  I really enjoy them."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This was worth the price,earpiece volume is great, no problem hearing incoming voice.  The only problem is that the mic is so far away from my mouth (as a result of such a compact product), that in order to have good voice transmission, I must hold my hand up and \"cup\" it from the corner of my mouth to the earpiece so my voice can be heard clearly.  This product would be perfect if it the mic portion extended a couple inches further towards the mouth."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was concerned after ordering this device, when I read many reviews that said this device was a cheap piece of plastic that didn't fit into their ear properly. When I opened the packaged and first put it in my ear, I thought \"oh no - they were right!\"But I then read the manual and after adjusting the \"ear loop\" and angling the headset slightly downward, it fit perfectly into my ear! It's snug, it doesn't flop around at all. It fits in a different way from your traditional \"ear plug\" device but in many ways it's more comfortable because it's not sitting in your outer ear canal but slightly further outside.So if you're thinking about ordering this device, I'd recommend buying it. Just spend a little time getting the fit right and read the manual about how to adjust the ear loop which makes a huge difference.(Functionally the product paired with my Cingular Hermes 8525 phone perfectly - sound quality is fine)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Overall, its a good set of headphones. Ive owned quite a few sets of bt headphones and by far i still dont think any are better than the Moto HT 820 setThe jog dials are good and handy, and they are comfy on the ears. they already send you the case with them too so dont buy it optional. They wont tell you this when ordering hoping that you will pitch them more money...They are also a little on the large side. If you purchase you will get cracked on for looking like DJ Khaled( Just giving heads up. the ht 820's that moto makes are the best ive ever owned. above any.But for the money these a great fit ....enjoy"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "What can you say. It's a genuine Nokia car charger. It's high quality. It's cheap, and it works. Bought one for myself. Bought one for my girlfriend. Bought another one for my girlfriend when her rabbit chewed up the first one. They all worked great.A friend of mine bought some no-name brand from a big box store. Paid more and it doesn't work as well. The no-name crapper charges so slow you'd have to drive around all day to charge your phone. If you are using the GPS feature while plugged into that one your battery still gets drained.No such problems with the Nokia DC-4. It charges fast, and will continue to charge even when using power hungry applications.EDIT: Note that this 2mm coax style charger will charge your device faster than the DC-6 Micro USB version (890 mAh vs. 500)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have been a satisfied Virgin Mobile (VM) customer for several years, happily using an Audiovox 8500.  VM uses the SPRINT cellular network which has a strong signal in my area.Lets talk about the SLICE which is made by UTSTARCOM.  I was very much attracted to this thin stylish cell phone.  I am not going to waste any time - what you see is what you get.  It is basically a pretty phone with very good reception, but the outgoing voice quality is below average.  The person on the other end will think you are swallowing water while talking.  Another issue is the cramped key pad.This cell phone reminds me of a pretty girl with the voice of cartoon character.  If you prize fashion over function - go for it.I am switching back to my AUDIOVOX.P.S.  You will feel compelled to purchase additional \"wallpaper\" for an additional $2, because what comes on the phone as standard fare is ugly!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "May not be for everyone, but I like it. The case is very solid. The screen is well protected while leaving ample openings for on/off, volume, camera, speaker, S pen, earphone, and microUSB port. Heeding the warning from other users that the beltclip breaks off readily, I intentionally broke it off :) and put the rest of the holder/phone in my cargo pants. Not real fast getting the phone out, but with bluetooth so ubiquitous these days, there's less need for speed. The built-in stand is a little unstable in the 'portrait' position, but works fine in the 'landscape' position. It also works well with a dash (GPS) holder: i.Trek ME-USDM Universal Dashboard Mount, also from Amazon."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've found that these are by far the best method for clipping my phone to my belt, I've used others many more expensive but always come back to one of these because of their built in kickstand and ability to easily and quickly slide the phone out.They're cheap yes but I've never had any problems with durability except after a long time of use, much longer you would expect such a cheap piece of plastic to last, that and on the ones with the kickstands like this that locking mechanism eventually wears out but the whole thing is easily replaceable.I have at times knocked the phone out my holster when bumping up against something but that is the tradeoff you pay for not having a lock obstructing your access to the device."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I gave this product a 3 because the clip easily broke off. the case is good which comes in two parts. A hard shell phone case is fits really well and you can use it just like that plus a sliding cover with a clip. The cover works like a screen protector and keeps scratches from the screen. The only bad side is since the phone is big and when you clip it on your belt, the clip snaps off its place when you sit down. 2 occasions my phone fell on a taxi seat because the clip detached it self from the case. If I was not watchful i could have lost my phone. From that time on i keep my phone in my back pocket"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this for hubby who works in a restaurant so having a thin profile case (to easily side in and out of the belt pouch) was a must. The stripes on the sides make it easier to hold onto. Soft tpu case slips right on and can easily removed again for washing. Good price too.The only downside about this case (and might not be for some people) is that because the camera lens on the back of the S4 protrudes a little, you should use a case that is a little thicker on the back to better protect the lens from scratches. This case was a bit thin in my opinion. Why Samsung designed this phone this way is a mystery."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First off, I ordered the BoxWave Simple Element Gray Semi-transparent case I had to point this our since there's only one review section for multiple cases.This case is billiant, it feels well, it has a better grip than a naked S4. It's really god that you can still see the samsung logo on the back thanks to the frosted plastic semi-transparent design but it doesn't get scrached up easily like a completely clear case.So, now for the important bit, cases are supposed to protrect your phone and this case definitely does that and it does it quite well. The one-piece hybrid design provides a very good protection to the frame against drops and the lay on thr table desgin also provides screen protection.Port access is good, I had no problem using the original Samsung equipment and a couple of other headphones.The ONLY drawback for me. Power and volume buttons don't provide a great tactile feedback when pressed with this case so this is why I'll shave a star from the rating."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Shows up totally deformed (top of the case doesn't even touch the phone because it was cast crooked), and I have to pay to mail it back to them if I want a replacement? I don't want a replacement anymore, I want a functional phone case. Definitely a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; kind of thing. The case is pretty inflexible, so when I took the case off, it also pulled off the back of the phone. Not the end of the world, but definitely a crappy case. Would absolutely not recommend."}

Great coverage of back and sides for protection, cut outs line up perfect.2. Pretty thin, doesn&#8217;t add much bulk.3. Glossy sides add a little better grip.Cons:1. Made my screen protector bubble up on sides2. Very slippery on back but glossy bumper on the sides, helps make grip better, could be better.3.

{"label": 7, "raw": "I ordered the Blackout and the Airwave (also by BoxWave) because I could not decide which one I wanted. They both fit my Galaxy S4 just right, nice and snug. They are not bulky which I like. They are not rigid plastic, both are flexible (but not flimsy) but the Blackout case is a little more flexible than the Airwave. These cases cover a little more of the front of the phone than the other case I was using which is nice because it covers the side edges of my screen protector, Tech Armor Ballistic Glass, but without interfering with the viewing area of the screen. By the way it fits great with that screen protector so I don't think anyone would have any problems with other screen protectors as this one is a little thick since it is glass.  You do have to push a little harder for the side buttons but that does not bother me. All openings on the case line up perfectly."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Beautifully designed case.  It provides great TPU protection without adding bulk to the phone.  It fits great, nice and snug so you don't have to worry about it ever coming off on its own, while still able to remove if needed.  The color is stunning on the black phone, a nice deep jewel tone.  The sides provide nice grip, and I love the matte back.  The only issue is how difficult the power and volume buttons are to press, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.  I would buy more if it came in more colors."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I looked at many cases from a few dollars to 50 bucks and chose this because oif the reviews and low costThis case is pliable and easily forms over the phone, with a tight fit.. You have to stretch the edges a bit to cover the front edges  but when all said and done its perfect fit.I was concerned about cutouts for charger and volume control, but these are no problem ,. plenty large enough to accommodate a charger cord of any type.Its removes as easlity as it goes on.For 6 bucks this was a real bargain and offers a better grip than the naked cell phone"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The product is as advertised - a genuine OEM Motorola battery. It looks exactly the same as the original battery that came with the phone. So it's not a generic brand. Works great too. Somehow the package got lost in the mail (or the seller forgot to send it?). But after I contacted the seller a replacement arrived within the next few days. Though the package looked beat-up or had been in the ditch the content was intact. Great and speedy customer care to make up for a mistake."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This arrived in what appeared to be a Nokia retail package, and had Nokia insignia on the cable. It appeared to be genuine. The package lists only a few Nokia phones by number, then says \"and compatible phones\". Orientation of the unique Nokia plug (?POP) is not obvious and the plug does not go in easily(until it's perfectly lined up). For my 6126 the plug needs to be oriented with the Nokia insignia to the front of the phone. Once connected the cable worked perfectly."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been searching for months for this package. The OEM price is about 20 times the price I paid here at Amazon.com - no kidding! Arrived before schedule, new condition, and came with everything advertised. It took a little time to install and had many updating to do but worked the first time after installation and works every time since.Anyone looking to purchase this package will be astonished and surely satisfied - I know I am. The application is thorough in design and allows for an extensive view of the internal applications of my cell phone (Motorola RAZR V3). Excellent phone and excellent application for data transfer between my computer and cell phone. An absolute necessity."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When installed according to instructions, this unit fulfills all its claims.NOTE that for the best success, you should separate the external antenna and internal base unit by as much distance and signal-obstruction as possible -- put the outdoor antenna at at the best available signal location, and the indoor base unit in the worst dead-zone.  Use every inch of the 50' cable supplied.My installation is in a steel-framed and steel-skinned building -- getting a signal inside was basically impossible. The outside antenna is on an old TV antenna mast 5' above the building roof, and the inside unit is sitting on top of a suspended ceiling in the center of the main area. Now I get 5-bars on Sprint anywhere inside the building, and 3-4 bars within 10 feet or so of the building outside. Our ATT data card gets a 5-bars signal also. (We are thus using both bands on this unit at once.)While not cheap, it is the least expensive alternative available, and It Just Works(tm)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have had experience putting screen protectors on phones for several years.  I generally do pretty good with installation and have a minimum amount of air bubbles underneath the screen.With this protector I cleaned the phone very well before installing and ended up with numerous air bubbles/pockets.  I was able to use a squeegie like device and get most of them out but the ones that are still there are seemingly magnified due to the mirror surface.  It makes them much more apparent than a standard clear or anti-reflective screen protector."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this with the intention of using it with my vast supply of rechargeable AA's, however to my surprise I discovered that it would only work with non-rechargeable batteries.  In fact it wouldn't even work with brand new Duracell Alkaline AA's.  Apparently it will only work with Energizers, though I'm not sure how that's technically possible.  As often as I would expect to use this to recharge my Evo Shift when I'm out an about, I would be buying and throwing away an awful lot of non rechargeable batteries, which isn't very cost effective and isn't great for the environment.  It works pretty well with the supplied Energizers that come with it, and it does have both Micro and Mini USB connectors, but because of the limitations it only rates 3 stars from me."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This product works great, my phone died on a camping trip, and I had bought 2 of these. They charged it so I could talk on the phone and text on the way back. I use the Eneloop rechargeable batteries so I can recharge them after I use them.The other reviewer does not understand that his cell phone battery can store more energy than 2AA batteries. These chargers will add a couple hours of talk time but not fully charge your phone. If you need to fully charge your phone I would suggest a normal charger because these would take too many batteries for normal use.I love these chargers, and will always keep one in my car. They have saved me more than once."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm not sure if I would wear this in public, but I got this because of the good reviews it received with regard to sound quality & noise cancellation. Sound is crsytal clear & deep. I got it to work with the Sony Bluetooth adapter, Sony Vaio laptop, my Nokia cell phone, & my iPod Touch. A big plus is that you can use it as a passive headset by plugging in a 3.5 mm audio cable. It's a good idea to purchase the carrying case to protect it while transporting or storing."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I do a lot of freeway driving and I've tried 2 of these speaker phones with myTreo and the noise cancellation feature is poor. It works fine below 45 mph but the faster I go the more my callers complain about the road noise. Also you have to turn off Bluetooth on the phone when you turn off the speaker phone.

By 4pm the next day, power had not been restored and the phone was going below 20% & wanted to shut down some functioning to conserve what was left of the battery life.  I attached the P790 with an adaptor I bought at the same time.

Since I bought my scanner, it has been next to my computer and I don't really see the need to take it anywhere.One thing I am curious about is that the case has 2 sides with elastic and only one scanner fits inside, so I can't figure out why 2.  Anyway, it is just an observation because it doesn't affect the fact that the slim scanner fits great in it and protects it well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought these today at WalMart, and they are terrible. After cutting with a paper trimmer, they were perfect size. Although after VERY careful and slow application, rolling on just a cm at a time, air bubbles would form. I tried rolling the protector on as slow as possible while rubbing from center out with a microfiber cloth. After application, and only rubbing the protector with microfiber, it was scratched past the point of no return. I cannot imagine what this screen protector would look like after a few days of use.Although this product may protect the screen, after a couple of days use you probably won't be able to see the screen with all the accumulated scratches. The users guide says for best results to replace monthly. After initial application I removed it and threw it away.Waste of money."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "use on 2cameras and cell phone.  The cutting is fairly straight forward, but the pre-cut edge that is supposed to help with seperating the backing from the protector is not cut well so i've wasted one sheet as it ripped easily while taking off the backing.  material not durable at all.  Got scratches just by using the squeegy in the package.  Lastly, if you had to reposition it, good luck getting the bubbles (hazyness) out.  Requires too much effort to get it right.

What's great about these is they have line and numbers, a grid that's formed to help you make a better, smarter cut for your mobile's screen. I even give these as gifts because people don't realize how much you touch your screen. It needs to be protectedThese are the best and I will continue to use these and search for larger sizes. These are the ones that should be on everyone's list. Great stocking stuffers as well!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "You can use this product to cut a high quality screen protector for anything with a touchscreen. That's awesome. Keep in mind that you have to cut and apply the screen protector yourself. It took me a few applications before I got good at it. Some air bubbles are normal, they dissipate after a few days. Lots of air bubbles means you are doing it wrong. Practice makes perfect.  You get 10 screen protectors for about $10.00 (or whatever they are selling it for) and the sheets they give you are pretty large. I think this is product is a very good value."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I thought this item was a good idea as it gives you the opportunity to mount your phone closer to the seat instead of up on the windshield.  I discovered 2 things:1) The unit itself is very cheap.  The adjustable arm used to clamp your phone has a major weak spot.  Mine broke right out of the package.  I made some repairs to strengthen it, but first use showed that this device does not work well with any smart phones.  I have an iPhone, and it's too wide and tall for this device.  You can't clamp your phone very well because of the cheap design, and the bottom ledge is too small.  After 5 minutes of driving, I had to remove my phone before it fell out.This is a good idea that was implemented poorly."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really did not want anything bulky. I already hate the fact that a case on my slim Iphone makes it bulky. But I dare not go with out. So I really like that the magnet does not really add more bulk. I was able to use the thinner metal piece and it even works through my case (it is a soft silicone case) So this makes me very happy. Again I have a decorative case and really did not want to cover up the design, nor did I want to tape anything to my phone. So I stuck it to the inside of my case and it works great!  No more trying to place my phone in a holder to use the gps. Now I can simply place it on and go."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the best device holder I've purchased! It has incredible hold for as much weight as the magnet will support. Having the holder come loose from whatever you stuck it to just isnt going to happen. I've had mine in my car for months and it hasnt budged. I have put many devices on the magnet and they all stay strong. The only complaint is the oval shaped metal piece is gold. It would be better for it to have been black. The smaller metal piece is significantly thicker than the oval shaped one and I wished it was a little thinner as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Mobile service providers claim that this type of antenna does not work, and I have to agree with them.  Installing it actually reduced my reception from 2 bars to NO bars!  If you search the internet, you will find that passive antennas like this are no different than that battery compartment sticker that claimed to improve cell phone reception, block radio waves from frying your brain, etc.  It doesn't work and it's a waste of money.I recommend buying a wired antenna that directly connects to your phone.  If you phone doesn't have such a connection, then you may want to look into a different phone because nothing without a direct connection is going to work, and you may want to look into a phone that gets better reception (there are some -- just read the 3rd party reviews).I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you just have money to burn.  If so, please just send it to my PayPal account instead."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is works and is cheap so I am still giving it a few stars, but I feel it is a little bit of tricky advertising and the item is not as one would expect.When you scrutinize the description it does state \"Brushed Aluminum Back Cover\" which I took to mean the cover is aluminum.  What it truly means is that the case is clear plastic and a little brushed aluminum plate has been glued only to the back.  In the picture it appears the entire case is aluminum which is what I really wanted, but not so. The case is clear plastic all around the sides and only metal on back. I'm not sure what the purpose of making only the back aluminum except to keep it low cost, but as anyone purchasing this is probably expecting a metal case it is a let down over all.P.S. The case is slippery."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Ok so i wish i felt i could give this 4-5 stars but 2 things really bug me, 1st and most annoying is the power button becomes recessed wit this case , the volume buttons have an extended piece that makes them ez to access but the power button doesnt, and 2nd the top and bottom seem to bow out a little and not quite fit almost like maybe a bad batch cause it is close really close but it bows out. so i love the look and feel, it shows off this pone. keeps the sleek curves. oh i wish that power button where easier to hit and it would be a case i really like."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am no expert on these headsets, this is the first one I have ever bought. That being said, I think this one is great. I have a Samsung phone and I was never really pleased with the way the mic picked up my voice and often people would complain of not being able to hear me but with this made my voice clear and understandable. I was worried of the background noise by the nature of the bluetooth but the AudioIQ seems to do an excellent job keeping the noise out, not sure how. It is simple to set up as well. Overall I am really pleased with this. Highly Recommended!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased Plantronics 665 headset to replace BlackBerry 655+ by Plantronics that went through washing machine (but surprisingly still worked fine after drying).  My wife also has one of these and she loves it.I like 665 as much as I like 655+.  The fit is comfortable and secure with the ear loop.  The sound quality is good on both ends. The battery life is sufficient for me I charge it once every two-three days.The only complaing is that the buttons are a bit hard to press.  When I push the main button the ear tip gets pushed into my ear which is not very pleasant.Overall, this is a great headset at a good price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have owned 2 Plantronics headsets -- The 665 and its predecessor, the 655. Both have suffered the same fate. The little rubber ear tips are flimsy and keep breaking. When I pick up the headset, the ear tip falls out. I purchased the ear tip replacement pack, which costs about $10 and you get 3 ear tips -- 1 small, 1 medium, and 1 large. Given that I only have a need for 1 size, I basically had to pay $10 for one ear tip... which broke after 30 days. The headset sounds pretty good, fits in my ear OK, and people say they can hear me pretty well. Despite all of these positives, I will be replacing it with another brand."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "This device works great.  It syncs in a second with any bluetooth phone, computer, mp3 player, or other device.  The sound quality is incredible.  The controls allow you to adjust the volume, pause, fast forward or rewind, go to the next song or the previous one.  Incoming phone calls will beep and you can pause the music and answer the call just by touching a button.  there are two different types of earpieces that slide on so you can customize your fit.  The unit is water resistant and very tough.  I use it while biking or just around the house as it is very light and NO CORDS!  Works perfectly.  I highly recommend it.  Cons: none.  do yourself a favor and buy one, you won;t be disappointed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased these stereo bluetooth headphones for use with my Blackberry Curve 8900.These headphones work well indoors with no problems with connectivity, however the story is quite different when I am outside with the Blackberry in my pocket...the reception cuts in and out to the point where its unusable.  Holding the blackberry in my hand seems to improve the reception somewhat but that defeats the purpose.This is quite disappointing since I wanted to use these when I am out running so I am back to my wired headphones.  I am not sure if this is due to the Blackberry or the headphones itself.  There were some posts over in the Blackberry Forums that complain of this same problem."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Case is large, certainly, but as are all cases of this type.  It fits well, even with a third-party wireless charging card inside the battery compartment.  I wouldn't say it exactly looks good though.  If you've had an Otterbox, it looks like the rest, you're sacrificing appearance and size for protection.  I got it mainly because it comes with a belt clip, and the GS5 is a pretty big phone to carry in your pocket, especially as the days get warmer.It seems to attract and hold dust a lot.  Perhaps lighter colors wouldn't show that as much.  Personally, I find that big chunk of rubber protecting the headphone jack unnecessary.  The headphone jack on this phone is waterproof anyway, and there's a very big cutout in the bottom to access the charging port."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I moved from an S4 with this same series case to an S5 with the case. The S5 case feels like it has a lot more grip. It doesn't fit 100% perfectly, but it's really enough that it looks really crisp and more snug than the S4. The biggest issue I have with is that the headphone flap isn't easy to fully close, but it also isn't easy to open either, so it protects that jack well. It's difficult to take off, but that's also good in the sense that it won't snag and come off. Don't get this case if you're often opening up your phone to replace batteries or SD cards."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was excited to rip the package open to put my trusted Otterbox on my new galaxy s5. Frankly, that's where the excitement stops. The plastic two piece holder which you place your phone in doesn't connect tightly, feels real loose over the phone before placing it in the rubber outside protection price. Once inside the remaining rubber piece the volume buttons don't line up properly nor does the power button. The strip at the bottom of the case that's right below the home button is to high basically making you disable the fingerprint scanning portion  of the phone. I believe Otterbox released this case just a little to soon before working the bugs out. I'm using the pelican brand case until Otterbox works the kinks out."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "At just under $50, the Otterbox Defender series cases are some of the most expensive on the market - but there has been very little innovative added in recent years. While I do agree with &#34;don't mess with a winning team&#34;, some phones (like the S5) have evolved a lot, yet the case has not. The finger print scanner on the S5 is very hard to use this Otterbox. Also, it is still not possible to use wireless charging with these cases, which is a real shame. Ideally, a company like this should keep innovating and ensure customers continue to invest in new cases.That said, the protection level is still quite good - not quite &#34;feel fine dropping it&#34;, but I'd certainly wouldn't be too worried to throw my phone in a bag. Additionally, since the S5 offers weather protection on its own, the value proposition of the Defender series is lost a little."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got the case the same day I went to purchase the S5. Case is easy to take off and put on after the 1st time of disassembly. As has been mentioned before the hole for the home button is off by a slight bit. It isn't enough to detract from usage, but Otterbox should fix this and offer panel swapouts to those users who request them. As I work in retail, I know many of these are already in stores. Most people probably won't care, but it may contribute to poor fingerprint sensor operation. Other than this, I expect a long time of protection for my S5."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love the otterbox and feel that it does a great job protecting my phone.  It does add some weight to the phone but that is the trade off for being protected.  My one issue is that it took several tries to get the case to fit snuggly on the phone the top corner just did not want to take.  Also did not like the plastic top cover from otter box only because I had purchesed from Vorizon a top cover that kept it from getting smudges finger prints.  The cutouts are fine and no issues charging my phone with the otterbox cover being on."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "I picked this one based on the reviews.  It seemed like it had the best reviews for the price.  And yes, it works, and it works great.The back has a protection sheet to keep it clean for mounting on a dashboard.  But it's not glue-based, even on the back, so it comes right off.  Cleaning it to get it back to new would be difficult since it sticks to pretty much anything, but I don't see that being a problem long-term, as it even sticks on a veritcal surface perfectly.  Of course your phone won't stay on at 90degrees vertical, but from the testing I've done, it works great up to and over 45 degrees."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This works and it comes with the hardware to mount it somewhere so it won't slide around. As an extension and socket splitter it is OK.However they missed an essential trick on the USB power supply. If a device wants a smart USB powered device like an iPhone or iPod to see it as a high power source, and not as a data connection, it needs to short the data interface pins with a resistor not more than 200k ohms. That is in the USB spec. You can tell this hasn't been done because when you plug in an Android phone it asks if you want to mount as a media device or a hard drive.So if you are looking for a neat way to power and charge a modern smart device then this isn't it. For the 2c it would cost them for the resistors the manufacturers really should have done this. I may even try it myself since it looks like there is room to work in there and I have an electronics lab to play in."}

I tried super glue but the glue may have gotten into the circuitry because the microphone stopped working.Overall, the headset feels flimsy and if you grip it too tightly, it will crack. However, we all want a lightweight headset...so maybe I shouldn't complain. The Scala picks up all outgoing calls automatically after you dial the # on your cell phone. However, you have to press the button on the Scala after picking up incoming calls. This results in a 2-3 second delay...an eternity if you've got another person on the line saying \"hello? hello?\".It's got its drawbacks but it's the only headset that works consistently with my Treo 650."}

When speaking with other people, they were able to hear me very clearly.  Occasionally, the noise canceling would cut off my voice if I was too quiet.  When driving in a car, this happened rather frequently.In short, this headset is an absolute bargain whose only drawback may be with regard to operating in noisy environments.  The Jawbone may be better at managing noise, but it's far more expensive.  Get this if you're looking for a deal."}

I am returning that unit (the replacement I bought reads 83 watts which is better). Some of the other units were off too, but not by as much. Otherwise this is a nice unit but could include an optional short power cable which makes it much easier to handle and use. I like the fact that this unit does not lose readings when power is lost."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Really nice device to keep track with your power consumption.  Easily allows one to see all information at the push of a button to see how much a device is costing you per hour, day, week, month and year.  Highly recommend.  Found out the Keurig coffee maker pulls more watts at a given time than the cloths iron does.  Very interesting to see what items are energy hogs and which aren't.  Plus it is a nice way to make sure that the energy saving items are really energy saving.  A CFL rated at 9 watts actually only pulled 9.1 watts which is within specs tolerance.  If you are a gadget minded person, you will love this device.  Hardest part of using this device was finding out what your energy cost is in your own area as this must be kept under lock and key if you don't have a utlity bill laying around to show you."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Not bad, I had one of the knock off brands of this, Chicago Tools one from Harbor Freight and this was about the same in accuracy except it obviously has all the features of storing all the data on how much total electricity that devic you plugged in used and estimated cost based on the cost per KW you enter in.  Pretty nice device, yes it sucks that the outlets get taken up when you plug it in, but its not like you need it on there for ages, you just need to see for a short period of time how much power that particular device is using and then take it off.  Since purchasing this, I now have a whole house monitoring system (TED 5000) and love it.  I use this now to monitor any single device on demand when I need to."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We purchased this in an attempt to weed out which appliances are causing our electric bill to rise.  It takes a little practice and some time interpreting the instruction manual, but it is worth it to see exactly what each item is costing on an hourly, daily, weekly, etc. basis.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it can be very inconvenient to plug things into it.  The prongs on the back are positioned in such a way as to take up the entire outlet cover, so anything else plugged in has to be removed first.  This would be many times more user friendly if it had a short section of cord on the back so it could be plugged in and still positioned in such a way as to be more viewable too.  You have to get down eye level with wherever it is plugged in to read its results because as soon as you unplug it the display goes blank."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "UPDATE: The display has failed completely on this product. While the buttons 'beep', the readout is blank. What a POS.  Now back to my initial review.I placed a 5000 BTU ceramic heater on this device to see actual usage. The device showed around 11 amps constant pull, but I left it plugged in overnight while the heater ran.  Several hours later when I checked the Kill A Watt again, it was warm, and its receptacle had deformed around the plug, making it impossible to remove.This device is supposed to have a NEMA-rated outlet capable of 15 A draw. This is what customers use a Kill-A-Watt for, to monitor real time use. Clearly this one could not handle prolonged use, and I wonder if I was sold a gray-market product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm mainly playing around with this device, testing how much my appliances use.So far I have not tested anything that used more than 350W, in all instances did the meter provide reasonably accurate results.I did not test many of the extra feats this device has, as I am only interested in the power draw of certain devices.Pro's:- It does what it supposed to do and moreCons:- The display is not back lit,making it hard to read the results in dark places.I bought it reasonably expensive, but they go now for just over 25, which is a good price!It is more accurate than reading from the electric box (from the electric company) outside your home, which would show 80W as 0.08kW, and would not be able to differentiate between 10 or 14 watts."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Yes - I use this about once ever two months...The latest case - I compared the Blendtec Blender which consumed 1546 watts on max while making a smoothie and then compared my old Ninja 1100 (rated for 1100 watts) but it only consumed 320 Watts on max!!! That is why it can't break down seeds and it SUX!!!I also detected that the ninja uses 2 watts while plugged in and off but the blendtec uses 0w.  Very handy device and it is a must for all that care about saving energy and giving our world a future."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is probably one of the most interesting tools I have ever bought.  I learn something new with it everyday.  Very easy to setup and use.  The only thing holding me back from a 5 star review is the design.  It pretty much requires exclusive use of both plugs (due to the shape) in a standard gang outlet box.  So I highly recommend getting a short jumper cable (they sell all kinds of them for plugging AC adapters ... aka wall warts ... into power strips) just get a high quality one that uses lower gauge wire and you shouldnt have any problems."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The product works fine and for the money is a good deal, however, the plastic faceplate on mine fell off (a little scotch tape did the trick)and it would be easier to use if it had a backlight. That being said, it's probably just the glue on this one that went bad on the face plate because the other four of them my company has have had no such problem. The lack of a back light though, makes you need to use a flashlight when you use it in tight quarters or under desks. I'd gladly pay another $5 -$10 if it had a backlight. Good devive though and pretty fast when you use it right. Not hard to learn either.Wayne"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got this on the recommendation of a friend. After speaking with him while he was using this headset, which was crystal clear, I asked my buddy what kind of headset he was using. He told me this one. So I picked this up on Amazon.I used it with a Sprint Sanyo phone and the performance was terrible. I lived with it since I knew I was going to upgrade soon. I upgraded my phone to a iphone with AT&T;, it was even worse. Turns out my buddy was using a Samsung phone. We think that this works great coupled with a Samsung phone but it seems to dislike other brands. In the end, it ended up getting washed in a pair of my pants and didn't work any more. Good riddance!I picked up a Plantronics headset and have not looked back!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When I purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset I was expecting good things.And though the headset is a little more cumbersome to put on than I'd prefer, and it's a little too \"clunky\" (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars), the sound quality - both receiving and transmitting is terrific!  Even with a lot of noise going on (like when I'm on my motorcycle), the sound is incredibly sharp.Now, I see that they have a new version out, and if they'd like to send me one, I'd be more than happy to see what changes Aliph has made, but I'm very pleased with the one I have."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The over-the-ear piece is a not a good fit for my ears. Moreover, they are extremely fragile and prone to breaking. Within 5 minutes of getting the phone out of the box, I broke the ear piece just trying to get the headset over my ear. I put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece. The plastic piece covering the control buttons seemed very cheap also, and I think it would be a matter of time before that broke as well. I generally take good care of my headsets and electronic equipment, so if the headset seemed fragile to me, it probably will for most. Also, as a woman with a small head, the headset just felt clumsy and big. On the upside, the acoustics seemed decent, but then I only used the headset once and decided to return it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've owned bluetooth devices by Scala, Motorola, and Plantronics.  The Jawbone is the first unit I've used in which no one has asked, \"Are using a bluetooth?\"  I think that, in and of itself speaks volumes.  The only drawback I've encountered is loss of pairity (if that's a word!).  It seems like about every couple of days it becomes unpaired.  Trying to reconnect doesn't work.  I have to remove the device from the phone and start all over again.  I'm not sure why this happens so frequently but I still believe the Jawbone is a superior bluetooth device."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have found the Aliph Jawbone noise shield headset to be a pretty good unit.  It fits me pretty well, doesn't fall out, has good audio for hearing, and I have consistently gotten good audio reports from the people I talk to.A few nits.  The charger hookup unit is just plain wierd, and is counterintuitive to hook up.  Why do engineers feel compelled to make thousands of different charging standards for similar devices?  Also, while talking, you have to be careful if you adjust the unit on your ear--it is easy to accidentally hang up on someone.Overall, this is the first hands-free device that I have actually been able to tolerate and use.  I am satisfied, although the unit is a bit pricey."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought the original Jawbone headset in 2007.  It is still the best bluetooth headset for audio quality, on both ends.It is quite a bit bigger and heavier than the other two Jawbone headsets I own, the ICON and the ERA, which everyone complains that they can't hear me (although I hear them fine).  I bought the newer Jawbone because I like to listen to podcasts when not on a call and both supported A2DP and the ERA proported \"hd audio quality\".I also discovered that the earpieces from the ICON and ERA also fit the older Jawbone perfectly and I don't have to use that silly ear clip (which is uncomfortable after a while).  Much better.I think I will go back to this headset for a while - the voice quality is great, the noise cancelling is also great, I can hear perfectly and its built like a tank.  I may even buy another as a spare."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "One thing about chargers these days is the build quality.  I've owned and thrown out so many that I've come to the realization that the cheap plastic $5.00 ones are the ones that break the quickest.  So I decided to spend a little more this time.  The Scosche is defintely built well, feels great too.  I've plugged in all my devices and all charge well.  I would buy again.Oh, i've purchased wiring harnesses from Scosche.  They sell good quality stuff."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I must have read more than 30% of the reviews on Amazon about the product. Nonetheless I decided to ignore the iphone 4 users that complained about not working and thus relaying on the product description. Alas, that was an awful choice. After connecting it and displaying the charging symbol about 2 minutes later it warned me the device does not support charging. I tried 3 more times and every time it kept dropping so I decided to leave it as such, even worse the battery seemed to have turned hot. It does charge other usb devices but it failed to deliver the purpose of its purchase: charge my iPhone 4."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this charger for over three years and it still works like a charm. Love that I can plug dual items into it while I am driving and it's great for long road trips when you need to plug in multiple things at one time. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking to charge ANYTHING that takes a USB port. Description says iphone 5, 5S, and 5C, but I've plugged in all sorts of things that have a USB charger and it works great.Worth the money!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is not one of those compact designer USB car charger things - but I like it and it does a good job. It feels nice - not like cheep plastic.It takes my iPhone 4S and my Jawbone Bluetooth device at the same time and charges them just as you would expect.The reviews on some of the compact designs did not fill me with confidence. I would prefer it to be smaller - but I would rather it was reliable.If the reliability changes I will update the review. So far so good."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had the Scosche USB Charger for 6 months and I absolutely love it! It has worked for all the devices I plug into it thus far and it has been very reliable. I use it to charge my Garmin GPS, phone, Kindle, Pocket PC, and a other electronic gadgets.The build quality of the charger is excellent. It has a nice, slightly rubbery feel to it. It is beautifully designed and will make an attractive addition to your car. The green LED light indicates it's powered up, and unlike a lot of devices with LED's, it isn't distractingly bright.If you need a Dual USB Car Charger, the Scosche is a good bet."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We own several Palm Pre's and wanted to use this dual charger to power them up in our car. Unfortunately this device can't provide sufficient power to charge 2 at once. It can charge one Palm Pre at a time, but can't charge up 2 at a time.If you have cell phones, or devices that need 800-1,000ma each, this charger can't do it. Total power out seems to be about 800ma split between the two USB ports.Other than being weak in the power department, the unit appears to be well constructed, it does fit 2 USB cords comfortably, and has a charge indicator light so you know when its in use."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "this is a great product for multiple devices in a vehicle that only has one port, i recommend it to anyone looking for extra ports in an older vehicle...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a cheap way of charging any device that will charge via a regular USB port. I have used it in my car for several months without a problem.  It did a fine job with my AT&T; Tilt phone and my iPod.Before you invest in this or any other standalone USB charger, you should make sure that your device will charge via USB cable alone.  Many phones (Motorola Razr is one) these days have what looks like a standard USB connection but require special software or adapters before they will charge.I got this for about $5 or $10 at Wal-Mart.  Great investment."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a very well constructed leather carrying case for the iPhone.  You can attach this to your belt and have the headset plugged in at the same time.  The case is tight, well designed and protects the iPhone while in the case.  The case is very tight at first, because it is leather, but will stretch slightly.  You cannot fit anything other than an iPhone (meaning no extra protective sleeve) in the case.Only complaint I have is that the iPhone has to be placed in a specific direction in order for the headphone jack to be useable.  I wish it was constructed so that the jack could be used no matter which way the iPhone was placed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My old charger didn't do anything for my Evo 4G - after 40 minutes of driving, the battery was maybe 1-2% higher.  This new charger (rated 950mA instead of 500) actually charges the monster Evo 4G - Even using GPS w/ Google Maps navigation and talking, the battery was fully charged at the end of that same 40 minute commute.The cable is a decent length too, and pretty flexible.Had to take off 1 star because the blue motorola \"M\" is waaayyyy tooooo bright at night, especially when all the other lights in my vehicle are orange/amber.  Nothing that a little black duct tape couldn't fix though..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Charges my phone quickly enough.  There's a convenient little clip that's hard to see in the photos, but which keeps the coiled portion together so the cable isn't flopping around all over.  It also gives a bit of peace of mind to know it's a Motorola branded charger that's less likely to overcharge/fry my phone.  One small, minor issue is that the light plug end occasionally pops out of its own volition after a warm/cold weather swing, but the blue light is bright enough so you notice when it goes out."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After reading all of the reviews, most of the other cases seemed a lot sketchier to me (reviews were very mixed).  I figured it was worth the extra few dollars to get a great one that I knew would work well (this was getting great reviews).  I didn't want to have to deal with trying to return a cheap $3 charger to some random company and risk that it would put my Droid on the fritz.  The extra few bucks was great for peace of mind.  It works perfectly and charges pretty fast.  No issues and love it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this adapter because my HTC Rezound is a power hog, and my other cigarette adapter chargers couldn't charge my phone fast enough.  This charger pumps out the power, more than enough to keep my phone fully charged no matter how many things I'm doing at the time.  I can have it docked and displaying GPS information with the screen at full intensity while on a phonecall using my bluetooth headset, and this charger does the job.pros:  Powers the most amp-hungry devices without a hiccup.  Solid construction, thick cable.cons:  The adapter end is quite large.  The end glows bright neon blue when plugged in, which can be rather distracting at night in a darkened vehicle."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Used this in my car.  While it was working, it was great.  Nice big blue light to let you know it's plugged in.  Some of the other chargers have tiny lights that are only visible from one side.  this big transparent power indicator light can be seen from both sides.The design of the charger is great.  It's just WAY too fragile.  The plug had issues 5 weeks after I got it, so now I'm looking for another one (but obviously, not a Motorola).I'm disappointed, I thought a Motorola product would last longer."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After reading the various reviews, I got this car charger for my Samsung Galaxy S phone and it charges wonderfully.  I also tried this on the Samsung Galaxy S II as well and it charges well too.  None of my devices got hot after charging.  The charger is also built well and will last a long time in normal use of connecting and disconnecting.  Having the coiled wire is also nice keeping it from getting tangled.  Pay attention to the current draw on your device.  This charger, if used with an adapter, could charge an iPhone or iPod; however, it will not charge an iPad/iPad2.You can't beat it for the price!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this charger for my Droid X, and it works just fine. I've been using this charger regularly for over 6 months with absolutely no problems. The cord is just long enough that I can talk on the phone while in the driver seat with the phone plugged into the adapter. Some people might find it more comfortable to find one with a longer cord, but good luck finding one for such a good price. The light on this charger is very very bright blue, which I find kind of hurts my eyes when I'm driving in the dark, but that's not a big deal to me."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This seems to be a great charger - when it works. It seems to work fine with my wife's Tracfone - a Motorola EX124G but would not charge my Tracfone - an LG 500G... so I'm reducing the rating by one star. I suspect the blame may lie more on the LG phone side, but I am still disappointed that I need another charger to charge my LG phone.By the way, I highly recommended buying from a reputable retailer to make sure you get the real thing. I bought mine from Amazon."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a great charger for almost any phone.  I purchased it for my wife's Samsung S3, but permanently borrowed it for my car after my failed purchase with the Samsung Official OEM Car Charger for your Galaxy S2 Phone.  See my review on the Samsung OEM charger for more details.The charger quickly powers your phone and looks good while doing it.  Motorola gave it a sleek design that lights up blue when the charger is ready.  The cord is long enough for mid size or smaller vehicles to keep it plugged in while using the Navigation app on your phone.  If you have a Samsung Galaxy S2 or S3 and need a back up or replacement car charger, I highly recommend this purchase."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I used the charger on one long trip and I can finally give it a review. Lets get right to it. On the trip I had 4g on, GPS on, Power Amp music player open and Carhome app opened. In the first half of the trip I noticed that the phone wasn't charging but it wasn't losing any juice either. It was just enough power to maintain how much battery was in there when I started the trip. With the carhome app the screen doesn't turn off unless you do it yourself. So I turned the screen off and when I got to my destination the battery went from 60 to 85% full in about an hour or so. The first half of the trip I wasn't happy at all with it because I thought it wasn't powerful enough to charge my phone. But after keeping the screen off and only turning it on to switch the song it really helped."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This car charger I use for ALL my devices with MICRO USB Charger ports. The charger lights up when the phone is charging and I have found to be genuine Motorola OEM of the highest quality. And it seems to charge much faster than my old generic micro car charger did. In fact, it charged my phone from 65% to 100% while I used it on a trip in just over one hour. I was using the phone while I was charging so this to me is great! So pleased that I threw my cheapie generic car charger away and just use this genuine OEM Motorola one."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My original review was \"best mobile charger I've owned\".  I even bought one for my girlfriend after she saw mine.  Now, in less than 3 months, both are failing.  It starts with a poor connection at the phone where you have to wiggle it or place it in a certain position to charge and devolves into not being able to charge at all.  Mine is a complete loss and hers is on the way out.  If I just had one and it failed I wouldn't give such a poor rating, but both failing together lets you know there is an inherent flaw in the design.  I've very disappointed because it was an excellent charger during the brief time it worked."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "With a new Mtorola Razr Maxx in my Verizon shopping cart, I was put off by the high prices for chargers and charger \"bundles\" so over to Amazon I came.Found this one here and have had no problems at all with it. The 12v plug fits snugly, the mini-usb fits the phone just right and that cool blue circle just looks great when running in the car.What can I say, the packaging looks pretty authentic for an OEM part, but my field is not in copyright infringement, so what do I know? :-)I really didn't expect to be impressed by the way a car charger looks, but it's really a nice piece of design work and the round piece at the end gives you something to grasp when removing it from the socket. And what a price! I would advise you to go for it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My husband & I were sharing one car charger between two cars.  This plan was not working out so well.I bought this because I have a Motorola phone and wanted to make sure it would be compatible. In reality...I just wanted the glowing blue circle.The charger does work quickly!  I've had no problems charging my Atrix HD. It is a micro USB charger so it also fits my husband's Samsung Galaxy3, my son's Nokia Lumia, and I've used it to charge the Kindle Fire.Works fast. Looks good.  Excellent buy.  I've had it since early August and there have been no issues.  I do keep it in my vehicle and it doesn't get moved around or handled very much. I'm not sure if that makes a difference but wanted to note it now in case there are problems in the future.  It is used at least 5 days per week."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Not much to say about this product except that it works exactly as it's supposed to. I have an HTC Inspire 4G and it works great with it, as it should with any Micro-USB device. The blue glowing Motorola logo is neat looking, but also makes the product bigger than needed...not a downside just figured I should mention it. I would reccomend it as a vehicle charger for anyone with a micro-usb device, especially someone with a smart phone since their battery life usually is not so great."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I only used this a handful of times before the connector wasn't making a strong connection to the phone any longer.  When that happens, my phone will charge only if I hold the cable to the phone and everything is aligned perfectly.  Otherwise, as the car hits bumps, it might charge for a minute and then not charge for a minute.  And yes, it's the cable and not the phone.  This is one of the problems with buying an integrated charger/cable unit... when the cable connector goes bad, the charger becomes useless.  And it does appear to be a genuine Motorola product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I would be quite content with summary like that...This thing has a few months of track record by now. I am happy, in the dark it makes finding the cord really easy because of that big blue illuminated eye... I have had so many crappy chargers I bought 2 different ones at the same time in case it dies prematurely, have not even tried the other one yet. It also fits snugly in the phone socket, and the backside of the plug is labelled with a shiny sticker, so you are not trying to force it the wrong way, eventually killing one or both of them... Little thing like that... need to appreciate the thought - because every day it makes your life easier..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I needed a 5 Volt DC power supply that could be powered from a 12 Volt battery or other 12 V DC power source. This fit the bill nicely and inexpensively. Clipped the connector off and used my own connector and off to the races it went. My DVM measured 4.99 V loaded at 600 mA and 5.01 Volts unloaded so I am pleased as punch. Plus the temperature rise is only a few degrees indicating good efficiency. Interesting packaging with the Motorola logo lit with a blue led. Might mention the two leads inside the insulated wire (one red, other black) are stranded wire of about 20 guage so I can see how flexing the cable at the connector when attached to a device in an auto might cause an intermittent break. A little duct tape or heat shrink tubing at the connector might not look pretty but should keep the wire from stressing."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a great charger with a bit longer cord which I really like! I bought one of the just wireless car chargers from Walmart for about $10 and thought I was getting a steal. I plugged it in and it made my phone reboot! Probably from a short, but never the less, I bought this charger and it works like a gem! My only complaint is that it does stick out pretty far (unnecessarily far) but for $3.xx I can't complain. Also, I think it charges my phone quicker than the just wireless one (when my phone wasn't rebooting). :) Get it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have heard many fake copies of this charger.  To be safe, just order it off Amazon's own online store unless you know the other providers are reputable.The quality of this car charger is quite nice.  The twisted cable is a nice feature since it can be extended and will not dangle wildly in your car when it is in motion.  I also had another micro usb charger and it used to take forever for it to charger your phone.  The only thing I liked about my previous car charger is that you were able to connect a usb cable into the usb ports it provided but the time it took to charge your phone was not adequate for me."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this item a little over a year ago.  The price point is great for a branded vehicle charger.  The styling is interesting and futuristic.  It did seem to charge faster than other auto chargers I have used.  One minor issue is that the blue lighting produced by the charger is somewhat distracting while driving at night. It is bright and can produce glare in the driver's peripheral vision.  This is easily solved by either placing tape over the light source, or just turning it sideways.  The charger worked great hooked up to my Droid X auto mount for over a year, but recently started working only part of the time and needs to be jiggled to get it to work.  You hope when you buy name brand over generic that you're going to get a little better build quality, but at this price I'm just viewing it as a \"lease\" and just purchased a replacement.  I'll try to treat the new one a little more delicately."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this charger to replace my AT&T; charger that simply couldn't provide enough juice to my SGS3 on long trips where I used the GPS feature. This charger is significantly faster, at least twice as powerful. This was an expected result as I have always had excellent experiences using Motorola's chargers.I took one star off because the LED is just way too bright out of the box for driving at night. Fortunately, they allowed the \"M\" circular window to be easily removed by popping out the bottom ring (look for a screwdriver indent). After removing the window, the LED is easily accessed, so I applied some white-out to the LED, which successfully lowered the light output to a tolerable level.The cord and connector seem to be high quality. The cord comes with a small hook to keep unwanted extra cord out of the way - a nice added touch.Very pleased with this charger so far overall. I have owned plenty of terrible microusb chargers and this one gets the job done right."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought two of these to charge my htc sensation. I have used both stock and aftermarket chargers. I got these because my old one broke at the micro-usb end. This has been really durable, especially at the micro usb end, where these chargers usually tend to fail. The added bonus to this one is that it charges the phone a lot faster than standard chargers. I find that a 1900 mAh battery charges from 0-100% in about an hour and a half. Most of my old/other chargers take a little over two hours. On a daily basis I find that it charges from 50% in about 35-45 mins."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this item from Amazon (not a 3rd party) and was surprised to get a full retail package.The plug design looks very cool, in my humble opinion. However, the Motorola logo makes the plug needlessly long. If you don't have much clearance where you're going to plug this in, you might want to consider a different brand.Also, the Motorola logo glows blue whether it's connected to a phone or not. If your car doesn't automatically cut power to your outlet when you turn off your car, you could attract thieves.Other than those minor issues (luckily, neither of which impact me), this cord is great. The design is fresh, and the entire thing is built with the quality you'd expect from a company like Motorola. I'm using it to charge myNokia N900, and it works flawlessly. On a 45 minute commute, I can go from >25% charge to 100% with Bluetooth enabled."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Item is \"as described\" as of 12/2010. No where does it say it is bulk packaging or retail packaging. Item arrived in 3 days in bulk packaging exactly like j. raftery's picture. Having owned this exact item 3 years ago, I am led to believe this is a genuine motorola item. Markings, feel, quality of coil cord, and genuine motorola accessory hologram sticker on tip of plug seem to be like my old one. Great price (around $5) and it works (HTC Incredible). I would recommend this item."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Well designed.  High power (1.0 Amp) so it can recharge your phone more quickly. Fits my car's cigarette lighter plug snugly and stays in.  The bright blue light is a bit much, but I'm getting used to it.  Cord could be longer.  Fits any phone that needs a micro-USB charger cable.  High quality construction.  Buy this -- you won't regret it.Warning: some phones, like the Galaxy S3, won't charge well if the supplied amperage is not at least 1.0 Amps.  Often, the amperage is not specified in the listings -- buyer beware."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a great fast charger by Motorola. It's increasingly trickier to determine if something sold on Amazon or elsewhere is genuine product or not. \"OEM\" isn't sufficient anymore and most of the non brand name stuff is junk. Be sure to buy \"by Motorola\" (or whatever your brand is - but Motorola will work for most) and these are now half a ten spot on Amazon and lots more in the store.My one complaint, and reason for dinging a star, is that the cord is way too short for use in most vehicles. It's fine for a non smart phone sitting in the console or a cup holder - but it's far too short for smart phone use with the phone positioned on or near the dashboard. I've been unable to find a micro-micro usb extension so I may switch to an power adapter with a socket and just use a long regular usb cable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have a Galaxy Nexus, and my wife has a Samsung Droid Charge phone and we use this as our charger of choice in both of our cars.  I've bought several different type of generic knock off chargers in the past.  Some that did work, but broke easily, and some that were so poorly made that they wouldn't charge my phone at all.  This Motorola made charger does a great job of charging my phone.  Even if I am streaming music via Bluetooth to my car and using my phone as a GPS, the charger is still able to overcome the power drain and keep the battery charging.  If I had to make one nitpick its the bright blue logo that is lit up while its plugged in.  Its not overpoweringly bright, but its unnecessary in my opinion.  Despite this, I still think this is the best value for a cell phone charger out there.  Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm amazed on how fast this would charge my phone. I thought it was a gimmick on the rapid charge but its not. I can leave my girl's house at 15% battery by the time I'm home it has 80% charge. We live about 35 miles apart. ***Update when I bought this I was using it for my old Motorola Photon 4G phone now I own a Samsung Galaxy S3 it's rapid charge not effective as it was with the Photon but it still does the job. I still like the feature of the blue light that glows once you plug it in to the 9V lighter port. Would be nice to have an indicator to show full charge/charging mode. Hopefully it'll be a nice addition to newer chargers."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had a lot of trouble finding a charger that will do anything but hold the battery steady on my AT&T; Captivate (a Samsung Galaxy S phone) while being used for GPS and with the screen on.. and finally, this one does it. It also does not present itself as a real USB device (many chargers show up as a \"connected computer\"), which is great.Only downside for me is the fixed cord (can't substitute cords for other devices), but for the cost of this, it's well worth one per car."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is only a 1 amp charger, and does work very well.  And you know, it looks cool with the light up Motorola logo.....really cool.But be forewarned, it will NOT fast charge a Galaxy Note 2......it will charge faster than a standard USB charge........but not as fast as a 2 amp charger.  And if you are using your Note 2 as a GPS, it will barely maintain the current charge.  If used normally, it will charge, but just not real fast."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I use this in my vehicle almost every day and it is a fine charger.It is very stylish as it has a Moto logo with a backlight that turns on when you connect it, people always ask about it when they see it and they like it.I use it to charge my good old Atrix 4G and it has a small problem. If you connect it when your battery is under 15% the low batt warning on the phone starts going crazy and you will see as if the charger is connected and disconnected many times. It is annoying but the phone charges anyway so i live with it.I am not sure if this is a phone or charger problem."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this for my Samsung Epic 4G (the 1st gen Galaxy S, not the new Epic 4G Touch) since the genuine Sprint charger I bought would not charge properly. It feels nice and sturdy and I have it plugged into a socket hidden inside my center console so the light doesn't bother me. It works great charging my Epic 4G. If it goes low enough again I might buy a spare.Update 1-2-2012:After 5 months of nearly daily usage in my car I'm happy to stay it's still running great. I bought a spare which I keep in my trunk for the day this one eventually dies, but since that hasn't happened I'm very happy and will definitely stick with this model for as long as I have micro-usb phones.Update 5-14-2012:Still working great! I haven't had any problems that I can remember."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm disappointed as the title said \"rapid\" charger and its definitely not that. I use my Samsung Galaxy S III in the car for navigation (duh). I was hoping keeping it plugged to this charger will, at the very least, MAINTAIN the level of charge that I had when I got into the car, even if not charge it up fully as I drive. No such luck. My charge kept going down. I had to switch the screen off so the charger could charge the phone up  a bit so it wouldn't go completely dead."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I originally bought this for a Motorola phone, and when I upgraded to a Samsung, I decided to continue using it since the connector was the same. It worked perfectly. I've upgraded again, and it continues to work. It is a rapid charger, and I find that it does charge my phone more quickly than a regular charger. It has a sleek style, and I like the \"blue light\" that glows when the charger is powered. I've bought these for my wife and two sons (and none of us have a Motorola phone). But what I love most, is the PRICE (under $6 as of this review)!!! Verizon would charge me quadruple for a charger.[...]"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This charger is one of the fastest I have for my phone. Being a Micro B USB it will work with almost any smart phone. The spiral wound cord works well for the short distance in my car, but still is long enough for the chasm of my old Ford Truck as well. The only drawback that I've come across is that bright blue LED that can light up the whole car at night. It's very distracting while driving and I strongly suggest rotating the charger so the light is away from the driver's eyes."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Bought as a charger for my MIL's new phone. I went with this version since the cable is built-in and there could be no mix-ups with what cable to use and where/how to stick it since my MIL is not very tech-savvy. She loves it and it works very well on her phone. The blue LED is not too bright for night-driving yet bright enough to see in daytime so you know it's plugged in. My recommendation would be to get a USB car charger so you can use whatever cable you want and since you have two separate pieces, if one fails, you only have to replace that part, not the whole thing. This however, follows the K.I.S.S. principle and works very well. I would highly recommend."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When I had to get a new phone I needed a different car charger. The store charged thirty five bucks so of course I said no. I knew Amazon would have it for cheaper and was I ever right. I paid a lot lot less with no shipping and handling. WHAT A DEAL!! Of course it works just as it should. I learned a long time ago to only buy Motorola accessories. The after-market companies products never seem to last. So if you're thinking about getting a car charger then I suggest getting this one. Even if you think you'll never need one, for the price it's worth keeping one in the glove box for emergencies. (Do they still call them glove boxes?)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have used so many car chargers for micro usb devices.  Many cheap made in china, chargers takes forever to charge the phone.  Some even do not fit well in socket, and some I had to position the charger to charge the phone.  In some charger cord came off from base charger and or micro usb end.After I invested money in this, it seems like solution of all problems.1. Durable cord, which I believe that will be fine during cold winter.2. Durable connections to base charger and micro usb end.3. Cool blue lamp which indicates charger is well connected in power socket.4. No problem with connecting and charging any micro usb phone.I liked it so much that I ordered second one to replace it in my second car!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my second charger like this (lost my first one... then found it the day this new replacement charger came in... figures).  Both have worked well with a Moto Droid X and Moto Droid Razr Maxx.  It charges just fine, at about the same rate as the OEM stock charger, so I assume it is around a 1A charger (probably just below 1A).  I don't care for the length of this thing; however, it's worked better than other chargers I've had."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This USB charger really does work quicker than the one it replaced.  I'd bought a generic charger from Amazon some time ago and at some point it got crushed and broke apart.  The Motorola is just a bit bigger than most chargers, but the glowy blue circle is easy to grip and doesn't get in the way of my gearshift, which is actually a pretty important thing to know when you drive a stick.I've noticed it charges my Samsung Galaxy SIII fairly quickly--with it below 20% I might but close to the top in an hour or so.  The cord is long and the coiled nature even provides more stretch if you need it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Wasn't sure what to expect with this, but it works flawlessly and it is very easy to use, as well as very portable.  Probably my only complaints are that you do have to read the manual very carefully to understand the various colors and blinks of the lights, but once you know your way around it - the device just works.  Callers cannot tell you are on a bluetooth and you can hear the callers very clearly.  It has exceeded my expectations.  Plan to get another one for our second car now."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Just got this on 6/5/2011 - Great automotive Bluetooth FM transmitter for Music and Speaker Phone for my iPhone 3G. Charged it fully right out of the box and then started using it. My unit came with the car cigarette lighter charger and literature.  I used a standard mini-USB power charger that I had and that worked fine.  Car charger also works well. Sound quality is great for both phone calls and for music through the car stereo. Tonal quality is fine on the stock stereos in my cars. For a more critical listening test, I set the FM transmitter for my Home Theater Surround System and the music sounds great on that also (good imaging and tonal quality). The unit appears to be durably constructed and should last."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the first BT ear piece I have had that actually works the way it should.  Very light, fits in the ear well and after a couple of days I almost forgot I have it on.  Some people complain about the unusually long button hold to end a call, but I have not had a problem with it.  Battery life is excellent.  Not as good in the wind as I had hoped but this is true of most BT ear pieces I have tried.  In the car works like a champ.Be sure you check the firmware version and upgrade to the latest.  The one I received was 2 releases behind.  This feature alone is worth the price!"}

I *LOVE* this feature.*Easy re-pairing after On/Off cycle*Decent battery life (I use my cell phone ~6 times daily, and it lasts 2 days)*Fits VERY SECURELY in my ear.Cons:*I've noticed a few times when the sound/mic stopped mid-call after about 30 mins.  Maybe I need a firmware update.*Other party can't hear me well with wind or background noise, even with the Enhance voice feature. But I can't imagine that many other devices perform much better*Learning curve. There are 3 buttons and with them, I can perform 20 functions.

{"label": 7, "raw": "It appears in the photo that these might be sturdy items to keep your flash/thumb drives in one handy place. Nothing's further from the truth. The &#34;thread&#34; is not much thicker than what you'd use to sew buttons with and the ring that you are led to believe will hold several items is barely 1/3&#34; in diameter. Furthermore, if you actually put a thumb drive on the ring, you'd need a pair of needle nose pliers to spread the ring apart, then forcefully close it back together. Yes, they are cheap and yes, there are several in the pack. But at over $8.00 in shipping (they come from Singapore), you can probably fashion a better thumb drive holder by using parts of old key chains. This is by far the worst purchase I've ever experienced on Amazon...who should be ashamed of themselves for selling such trashy junk.The jokes on me...I fell for the hype. Don't let that happen to you."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have numerous amount of USB thumb drives which all have the little loop on them. However, do to cost cutting, they don't come with them any longer. So I decided to purchase some for myself. I have a USB drive that is thumb nail size. This one has the smallest loop of them all but with the help of a paperclip, i was able to get the strap in. This allows me to remove the drive from my PC with little trouble. They are not too long about 2 inches, so they are the perfect size The price for 10 wasn't much more than the price for 1, so it made sense and I have extra in case one breaks.Though the scheduled arrival date was a few weeks back from what I wanted but it did come within that time without an issue. All 10 appear to be in good shape and are not damaged upon arrival. They came in a small clear zip bag, within a large shipping envelope."}

Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning, but it's pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros:- Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept, rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons:- Doesn't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 doesn't contain a whole lot- It's obviously pretty expensive. I guess if you're *really* interested, it's worth it.For it's purpose, it is almost perfect software. You will feel confident with the basics after this."}

I have my &#34;throw away&#34; wallet in my pocket with expired cards and a few dollars.I like the various pockets and zippered security to keep things in place.  The neck cord is a little long so I had to tie it off so the stash would fall mid chest making it a bit more concealed.4.5 stars - minus 1/2 star for long cord and a flimsy feel.  Again though perhaps being flimsy is a good thing being under clothing making it conceal more."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Soft and really light.  Works really well and is very well thought out with 2 zippered pockets and an large Velcro pouch with 2 separate pockets.  I find this a very good arrangement.  Money in one zippered pocket and card and license in the other and the cell phone in the Velcro pocket. I also like the adjustment on the length of cord so you can wear it high or lower.  Not my everyday wallet as a full size Spec Op but this is great for days when more security is need or no pockets."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this item to attach the handle of a backpack to a 22&#34; carryon.  The strap is well constructed, but the minimum length is too long to avoid your backpack from dragging the ground when pulling the carryon. A laptop bag or purse is fine, but not anything as vertically high as a backpack.  I purchased the Travelon bungee cord for this purpose and will try it on my next trip.  I'd shorten the minimum length of this thing and it would be fine.  Otherwise, it will be fine with a checked bag coupled with a smaller carryon or purse/backpack. But for smaller luggage, not so much."}

Over the years the watch has taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but, I still get a lot of comments about the watch.  The altimeter (incl the memory function) worked very well.

They both love playing with all of the included accessories, and often throw in a few additional items of their own.  The purses and accessories are all very durable, in fact, I had to put my daughters' initials on everything because I really can't tell the difference between the new items, and the items that we've had for a couple of years already.

It's a great watch at $67, not quite as good at the higher price - note that CostCo sells them for $69.95.  The links are truly a bear to remove.  I suspect that the link removal device sold on Amazon may not work due to the particular design of these links.  You have to push the linking device out from inside the band rather than from the outside edge of the band."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The kids just love this. Why---no clue. I ordered it because my friend asked me to order it for her daughter, so I ordered 2---one for my daughter as well. We live in the caribbean, where it's hot, so a thick plush backpack is something you don't want to have on your back. The color is cute too, but I can see it easily getting soiled. I didn't let this backpack out of the house, and ended up giving it to another child.I liked the pull-out map feature that comes attached to it though. The flap stays closed with a magnetic closure. Good size."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got these for my daughter because I favor black Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star high-tops myself when I wear sneakers, and she likes to clomp around in them, so I thought I'd get her her own pair. Once she found out they come in pink, no other color would do.  Sigh.  But they are SUPER cute, and the lacing up the ankles means they fit tight and won't come off, but lots of room to grow through the toes.  One drawback, the laces are hard for a toddler to manage, and she has extreme difficulty getting them off by herself."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I work with a friend who is the biggest Chuck Taylor fan of all time.  She has who knows how many pairs of Chucks (over 20), and always seems to wear a different color every day.  So to be a good friend, I had to get a pair.  Red, being one of my favorite colors, seemed the right choice.  I bought size 6.5 Men's, which translates to 8.5 Women's.  The fit is good!  These are heavier than I would have expected, but they aren't uncomfortably so.  They are very sturdy considering so much of them is made from canvas.  My feet feel well supported.  While I probably won't go bonkers over them, I might have to invest in a second pair."}

And don't seem comfortable either. they need to create this same shoe, but but an easy access ZIPPER on the side, down to the toe bed to get the young child's foot inside."}

I searched and searched and I am so glad for Amazon's buyers writing reviews because this is what made me go for it.  I read most all of the reviews to make my determination of size because I made a mistake before because I didn't know to order a size smaller.  If you a female and are buying a pair of Converse you better get a size smaller if the listings say Converse Men.  I Love, Love, Love these dang shoes and I love the fact that now that I know what size to order.  The fit is perfect."}

I initially got them for dead-lifting back when I trained with weights. Since then, I've been using them for casual wear and they've held up very well.

They keep my feet flat and stable when I am straining to lower and raise the weight bar on my shoulders. They are comfortable and utilitarian during the other exercises.I would not wear them as everyday shoes - to me they are not *that* comfortable.

These are great.  Fit is good, quality good, and they came with an extra pair of shoelaces!  No arch support at all,  but you need to know that before you buy, so you won't be disappointed.  I put in a pair of my Dr. Schols inserts and I'm a happy camper, lol.  Have been wearing them constantly since they arrived."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Chucks since I came out of the womb. I've been through many pairs, and after I decided to retire my old black ones due to a blown out heel I wanted to go with something new. The white is really an eye catching color, and more subdued in person than some of the pictures out there. BE WARNED, Chucks are about a size bigger than your actual shoe size. For example I wear a size 7 in women's, which would be a size 5 in Chucks, but these are really too big so I went with the size 4. I find the white adds some contrast, especially if you wear dark colors like I do."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this bra, fits tight and holds the girls in but i will say right after i got it one of the snaps broke off i think it was defective so now i have a bra i paid alot for that one hook can't be snapped but other then that i love it, i have went thru alot of bra's and this is by far the best support it is kinda hot and takes a little getting used to it is my first compresion bra, so that may be it for me, but i would say if you are larger busted try it, i just wish my bra would not have broke it would have got 5 stars if it had not broke. i was very disapointed in that but like i said not one of the other snaps have broke so i really think it was a defect of some kind."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm a very active person with a 34DDD chest.  I am forever on a search for the perfect bra.  For sports, this is it.  I can wear it in my highest impact activities, and everything stays put.  It's not really attractive, and sure doesn't look great with a spaghetti strap work out top, but it does the job.  Getting into it is a little tricky; you start at the bottom hook and work your way up, adjusting your breasts as you go.  It is supposed to feel tight, so you might think you have the wrong size at first.  But after wearing it for a few minutes it feels comfortable.  ZERO bounce or movement.  Incredible!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, I normally wear a 40 band bra, and an F/G cup depending on the brand. In a Lane Bryant Full Coverage bras I wear a 40DDD. I followed the measurements and this bra holds very well, but I have spillage at the sides and the top. The band fit correctly and I honestly feel if I went up a size the band would be too big. For myself I will seek a bra with cups and not numbers. This bra is awesome if you are a 40 DD, (40 DDD the biggest) as the sizing chart states. I give credit to the fact that for the cup sizes provided was correct. I guess my &#34;girls&#34; are just way too big. I will keep it and wear a compression vest on top of it.  My measurements did fit a size 4 though, so for ladies looking for some serious hold, definitely get this."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra is very durable and I love the thick straps that do not cut into my shoulders - LOVE IT!  However, the measurement method and sizes will not always be correct, as the recommended way to measure may be correct but the sizes recommended are not.I did the measurements as instructed and was given a size to buy and the cups are way too small - my breasts are spilling out on the sides.  Some may be wanting to say go a size bigger but if I do, the bra will be too slack, as it is the bra is very comfortable but the cups are way off.  I need a bra just like this but with bigger cups.  Any recommendations?"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have 40/38 DD size breasts but I love to run. :-( THis bra has been my go to bra when running, doing HIIT and Turbo Fire. I've tried other bras such as the Panache and to double bra other bras but nothing compares. My ONLY gripe is that it's not adjustable and at 64 bucks a bra that sucks especially if you're losing weight because you'll have to spend more money on a smaller bra. Get this bra if you're looking for maximum support. I'm actually going to buy another one because I don't want to have only one."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra does what it claims it will do--it provides firm support even for plus sized women, and the support doesn't go away after washing.  I just wish it weren't so shiny.  It's not terribly attractive, just functional, but the straps will show with most clothing, so you may want a lacy camisole over this.  Unless they can change the shininess without reducing the support, I'll live with it 'as is'.  A great bra in terms of function!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Pros: no bounce, very supportive, holds everything in & even does some minimizing.The big con is their goofy sizing. I ordered according to the measuring system the company uses, which put me right in the middle of the #2 range. It turned out to be too small in the cups, especially. I experienced the same ass everyone else in that the band is waaaaay tight! It gave me head & neck aches wearing it the first few times, though I did not mind the extra back support. I read that this bra is supposed to be extra tight so I just accepted that. But I can't accept boob spillage out the sides & squishing them together in the middle. I love this bra, I love the idea behind what it's supposed to do. I guess I just need to do some re-sizing, maybe up one or two sizes & see how that goes. I really want to love this bra!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "First one arrived with the little plastic hook that connects the bottom strap broken.  Not sure I like this way of connecting strap seems cheap where metal may be better way, as women even this size is smaller than previous ones owned by LL Bean.  Wanted to have smaller bag hoping to lighten my load, so to speak as my shoulder is paying the price now older. Nice pockets with magnets on outside and set up the same with many pockets. I will use the second one sent to replace first but, will most likely go back to LL Beans.  The only thing on that one after years of use the zipper stopped working."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Good quality, handy and functional, no bells and whistles just a leather product that works.  I like the coin compartment being on the outside and available without having to open up the whole thing.  I don't like the zipper coin compartments because they don't open wide enough so this is just right.  And the style and color is nice/classy.  It also has a check book holder inside and about 5 credit card slots.  The place designated for your driver's license has a cut-out in the center of the plastic to help get hold of it to take it out when needed which is handy.  It also has a zipper compartment inside to store stuff you want to keep but don't use as much.  Very nice."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a very nice wallet.  I purchased this one to replace the exact same wallet.  My old wallet was identical to this but was about 15 years old.  (They do wear out after 15 years of constant use.)  Buxton always makes beautiful quality leather goods.  I like that the change purse closes with a metal clasp and not a zipper.  I especially like that there is a divided change purse --- I use one side for pennies and the other side for all other coins.  Also,  I like that there are two paper money slots ---- I use one side for bills and the other  side for checks.  (yes I am very organized.)  I like this wallet very much."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I absolutely love this wallet.  I've had it for about 2-3 weeks and its durable and pretty.  It looks exactly like the picture, its got plenty of space.  The only thing I will mention is that in the cash parts, there is an opening, so you can't put loose pieces of paper or anything in there, because it might fall out.  Otherwise its great, there is enough space for a bunch of cards, cash and change.  The wallet can feel a little bulky when completely full but its great."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered this wallet on a Friday, and I received it the following Tuesday, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I ordered the red one, because red is my favorite color. It is VERY nicely made. Very roomy, has LOTS of places to carry cards etc. The leather is nice and soft to the touch. I think that I am going to be VERY pleased with this wallet for years to come. It also came in a very nice box, so that if anyone were getting it for a gift for someone it would be easy to wrap."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is the closest thing I have found to a wonderful compact wallet I bought in Italy and used to death. It appears to be well made and I think it will stand up to wear. It has as many pockets and compartments as I need. I appreciate the change purse part that opens up with a snap fastener. Many other wallets have a small gusseted change section that is zippered and doesn't open far enough for you to see what change you have. I wanted something that didn't require me to empty all the coins out to find what I needed."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just ordered this item for my wife as a gift.  She was very happy with this product.  I don't know anything about it, sinceI don't carry one of these.  All I can advise to the customers is, what she said about this product.  She stated that itwas a well known brand, and she liked the soft leather and the well organized compartments in the billfold.  She reallyliked the quality and the full rich color of the leather.She advised that, a product such as this, is hard to find in the department stores locally.  She was very pleased with thelooks and color, and the percise arrangement and the design.  Must be a good one, she is very happy with it.The picture and decription of this item, is right on the money, on the sellers page............."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered this slip using Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping and received it one day early.  The package was in excellent shape. I am very happy with Amazon Prime delivery.The slip was exactly what I wanted the nylon material feels very good next to my skin and the lace adds a very nice touch to this slip.  The fit is excellent and the length was just what I expected.  I will be ordering more of these in different lengths and also in black.  I wish there were more color options than just black and white.  I have purchased other Vanity Fair slips and have not been disappointed with any of them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I recently bought several wrap and faux-wrap dresses that could show off WAY too much leg if there's a slight breeze, so I needed something a bit modest to spare the world a view of my blindingly white legs. This slip works PERFECTLY. It's beautiful and comfortable. It also makes me feel a bit like a '40s film star. Women need to dress like this more often!The fit: I ordered my bra size. I've got that lovely pear shape going, and it still fit perfectly over my hips. I'd order more colors (I got the black), but they're all out of stock! Bummer."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is my second garter from Rago and it's amazing. If you're looking for shapewear, this is the brand you want. Don't bother with Spanx, they're not gonna hold you in. They'll smooth all the lines, but this one will give you the firmed up, 1950s look. I work at a 1950s clothing shop and I'm not the only girl who wears Rago!Also, I'm a petite girl and Rago has sizes for me. Shapewear in smaller sizes can be difficult to come across.Anyway, Rago is an amazing brand, please don't hesitate to get something from them. &#60;3"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Purchased this to wear under a formal dress for a wedding.  The control and slimming aspects are outstanding; really made my dress hang well.  Unfortunately, every time I sat down, the bottom would ride up so once I stood again I would need to slip into the ladies' room to pull it back down.  I avoided anything with a seat because it becomes so cumbersome to go to the bathroom and thought this would be a good alternative but it was not.  I would buy a Ragu product again just not this style."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a rago 1359 obg every day. with it on I have a flat tummy again. Wearing a girdle does meanwearing panties under (Vanity Fair Nylon Rivissant) - to help put it on and stockings (Berkshire It Fits)toprevent ride up. Dressing in the morning takes a bit of time but my girdle does stays in place. At first it is tight, then comfortable, and then I forget that I have it on. I do not have that girdled look and I really dolook better with my girdle on."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So, I love the idea here, but there are some considerations. First, the S/M is more for training bras or people who are very small/petite. So, I wish they would just call it Small rather than S/M. I think most women would need the Large/XL, even though it sounds big, I think it suit more people.Second, the right fit is important because if it's too tight, the part that grabs the back of your bra straps starts to cinch the strap, so you have two, tiny bunches by your shoulder blades that stick out like little bumps on your back.Finally, the clips do slip once in a while, so there is a chance they'll come undone. Then you'll have a swinging strap on your back.Again, I like the idea here, and it's better more often than not. But it's not as revolutionary as I thought it would be. :)  I'm still waiting for a better solution."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Love this beautiful nightgown.  I was looking for a pretty but practical peignoir set which is surprisingly hard to find, and I settled on this nightgown with the matching robe.  I am 5'7&#34; 150 lbs and wasn't sure whether to get the medium or large.  I played it safe and went for the large, but its a bit big and I think the medium would have fit well, at least for the nightgown.  I would probably still choose the large robe. The rosy pink is a beautiful deep pink, the gown is the perfect weight for wearing and feels wonderful on.  I knock off a star however because as others have mentioned, it is too sheer to wear without the robe, at least for me. I plan to order the short set for summer wear.  Maybe several!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This gown is generous in fit, soft, washes up beautifully and comes out of the dryer with no wrinkles and packs easily. I would suggest going down one size if you are between 1x and 2x. The color is exactly the way the photo shows and is a deep hot pink color.  I bought the matching robe as well and the same can be said about it as the nightgown.  I do not find it cool to sleep in, as other reviewers mentioned, but it is certainly comfortable and pretty enough to wear it around the house and especially when visiting friends and you want something to throw on quickly to make those bathroom trips in the middle of the night! The style is rather matronly, and is  suitable for mixed company or when you need something simple to wear while getting coffee in the morning."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Truly terrible.  I purchased two of the three packs and upon opening one package I discovered that they were full of pulls that would lead to runs during/after first use.  Next I tried on another pair only to discover that whilst the length of the stocking was fine the spandex/elastic was so weak that they almost immediately fell down even though they fit.  Also, I found them to be very sheer.  I thought that by purchasing the 'fantasy black' that they would be more like tights in color but that was not the case.  Overall, very unhappy with this product and will be returning for a full refund."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very nice bra, but the material is a bit stiff, which keeps the girls where they're supposed to be, though. It'll give a pointy shape, which is not very flattering with regular t-shirts, but will add some lift with \"flowy\" tops.BE AWARE: even though it says that this item qualifies for free returns, you will have to pay for the shipping costs if you want to return this bra!!! Amazon customer rep told me it's because the product is not sold/fulfilled by Amazon itself, but by a 3rd party. It puzzles me why Amazon mentions free returns on the product page when it doesn't apply  to that specific product. On a product that doesn't cost much, having to pay for return shipping is quite a waste."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was looking for a casual bra to wear when I worked in the yard and chose this one based on reviews and price.  It's going back.The bra is thin with old fashioned pointed nipples.  The material fails to stretch to adapt to breast dimensions, causing some areas to be too tight and others too loose.  It felt uncomfortable (not too tight - just too rough) as soon as I put it on.Because it's a Bali, it's probably durable and would hold up over time better than cheaper bras but I just can't get over the positive reviews so I'm giving it only one star.For a better fitting and much more comfortable bra, try a Victoria's Secrets wireless cotton bra.  It gives you the smooth coverage you want, excellent support, and you won't even know you are wearing it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I almost always order Bali bras because they are true to size.  I ordered 44DDD and it fits me perfectly and is very comfortable for maybe half a day.  After about 5 hours the underwire started to poke under my arms.  I much prefer not to wear any bra with an underwire because they are notoriously uncomfortable, but apparently there are none in my size.  The covering on the underwire is quite soft and cushiony but still the wires poke through into my under arms.  I am disappointed but maybe I am ordering the wrong size."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This isn't as 'sexy' as some bras, but it looks GREAT under clothes, and is supportive without feeling constrictive. Sometimes when this is sold in outlets, something is 'off' in the material; it's a little scratchy....but from Bali or as this was sold from Amazon, it's l00% right.  Washes well and lasts so much better than some of the fragile bra fabrics.  Maybe not so special for 'date night', but for a great bra to wear all week, it's terrific."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Being a very busty woman, I'm constantly looking for a bra that will smooth and minimize my proportions. Bali is a trusted name in intimate apparel, so I tried out this bra. I love the way it feels and how it makes me look when I wear tee shirts and sweaters. It runs true to size, so I didn't need to return it for a larger size. I recommend this bra to women who have the same problem as I do with finding a bra that will fit and look good!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I find this bra the first time I wear it is excellent, but then I wash it in the machine in a bag...and it seems to shrink in the cup!  I don't get that at all.  I]I'm a 38DD right now and losing weight, so for a cheap bra I can wear till I get down to a 36C this one will do.As the title says, not the worst, not the best...just ok.  And the 38DDD cup is just too big...I tried it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra does provide support & lift, but it is not 'seamless'.  This bra is part of the Bali &#34;Classics&#34; collection, so it's been around for a long time.The cup isn't a stretchy type of fabric, so you can see a little of the cup material through my tops.  And, you can see a little of the cup seam (slightly).I just bought Bali Passion For Comfort Minimizer Underwire Bra, and that one is seamless-  that one is a stretchy type of material.  It smooths out over the breast.  So, you won't see the cups through your tops with that one-  although that bra fits a bit more snug."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm 56 yrs old. Size 34DD. There are only two bras that I can wear. This is one of them. Amazon is a great place to purchase it as the price is less expensive than stores (Kohls rarely has my size in stock) and it seems to always be in stock. I hope Bali keeps on making this bra. Within the last year I did have an issue with a bra (a piece broke) but I called Bali and they replaced it for free.....UPDATE..this has happened twice....the adjustment pieces on the straps are made of thin plastic. Thin plastic to hold up DDs??????? Cheap."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "first off i'm 4'9, 34 dd, an its hard to find a great bra that actually fit.now because i'm heavy on top, i have the bras that have skinny straps that dig into my shoulder leaving me sore and a mark. this bra is heaven, it fits like the picture.now it doesn't give much lift if that's what you, want but it supports an don't poke you (wire) or cutting into your shoulder.now far as making me size look smaller... yes! and when i wear shirts it don't leave those lines.i will buy more!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "38DDD.  I wasted way too many years buying Lilyette.  Lilyette quality has diminished dramatically over the past year and I was concerned about finding an alternative.  I tried the Bali Satin Tracings Minimizer and was pleasantly surprised.  The Bali is rather comfortable. Washes well.  Life-span is average.  You'll know when to buy new when you feel the fit change.It is also a 10X better minimizer than any other bra I've tried.  In fact, I used to need apparel tape to keep the front of my blouses from gapping.  With the Bali, my clothes fit perfectly without needing that bothersome tape.  Hopefully, they will make this bra forever and leave it just the way it is...don't change the fabric, don't change anything to make it &#34;new and improved&#34;."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I think I will like it better once its washed several times and stretches just a little.  I have had these before and found the same thing.  If they offered half sizes, I would have gotten a half size larger.  I know the next size up does not fit...its too big, BUT this is a nice bra, does a good job of minimizing.  It does go up a little into my arm pits, but I don't think that will bother me after it softens up a bit.  Like the straps and shape of cups.  Well made.  I would love to find a bra that I give 5 starts to but probably will not in my lifetime."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have very narrow shoulders so my bra straps constantly need hiking up. Many years ago, I finally found a Wacoal that stays put but it no longer fits and is being discontinued. I have tried every single other brand on the planet and they all slip off so I got this to hold them in place. It works perfect. I wish I didn't have the extra bump across my back but it's better than constantly reaching in my shirt to pull up slipping straps. I like that it is adjustable, too."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is too expensive for the cheap quality of this product! Because the plastic is so slippery, when you put it on the back of your bra and attempt to adjust it to your liking, as soon as you begin to raise your bra straps onto your shoulders, the little adjustment clip will slip/revert back to the starting point of where you begin when you tried to adjust it. I can see this happening if I were over weight and/or had large breast, but Im a size 8 and a B cup so this shows you how defunct this product is. Furthermore, the company I bought this from here on Amazon (i.e. Lady Grace) has an outrageous shipping cost! This piece of crap should be half the cost to ship but the company charges an unreasonable shipping fee because they make you pay for them to mail you their unwelcomed catalog (along with this cheap gadget) which I threw in the recycling bin as soon as I got it. Total waste :-("}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These tights are extremely soft and very flattering. They fit perfectly and looked very sleek and of high quality. The only thing is, I purchased the barely there color and it is a little darker than the picture. In fact, it is more of a tan color and would go perfectly with people who have a tan complexion like I do. You really can't tell I'm wearing tights until you come closer and even then, it is such a nice, sophisticated look. These tights would go great with formal evening wear and dresses."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Hanes Silk Reflections for over 15 years now and I still love the sheer look and silky feel of them on my legs. I have many pairs of Hanes Pantyhose for daily wear in different colors as well as Silk Reflections Thigh Highs and Stockings. I have tried other brands but always come back to Hanes Silk Reflections. I have tried other brands of pantyhose that are as sheer but not as durable, I have found some that are as durable but not as sheer, Hanes has it all for me.  The fit is perfect they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles even after a long day.I am an Amazon Prime member and that has been wonderful the shipping is always fast and on time. Whenever I can find my Hanes hose with Amazon Prime available I purchase them. It is so much easier to buy these online and have them delivered at no cost I am so happy with my Amazon Prime membership."}

{"label": 8, "raw": "Ok ladies, pantyhose, in general, are getting difficult to find anymore.  Many women hate them.  But, for those of us that don't have a problem with them, it seems as though there are expensive tights or leggings to choose from, and no more 'pantyhose'.  Let alone NAVY.  This is the real deal.  I plan on buying more for my 'stash'.  These are the tried and true navy pantyhose and I keep a few pair in my desk for that occasional runner that might happen once every other year.  You get what you pay for, and these are a bargain for the quality.  Love them!  Thanks for carrying, Amazon.  Now, I can save gas money from running all over the place looking for navy hose."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I found the band to be a little bit snug, but it otherwise fits pretty much as expected.  However, don't be fooled by the picture for this item.  Unless you have naturally perky breasts or you would actually wear a half size and size down, your breasts are not going to sit that high in the cup.  As with all demi bras, beware: any upper chest side boob fat you may have will be smushed into adorable little rolle, in a most unfortunate and highly visible manner.  Don't buy this bra if you are carrying 20lbs extra or more.  You will not be happy with the results."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was so excited for this bra and when I got the 38D  the wire part fit great and actually supported ALL of my boob instead of cutting in too close on the sides.  The cups were just a TAD too big, and I could have gotten it tailored I suppose but I returned them for a 38C hoping that, being a 38, the underwire would still be wide enough too include all my bits but have correct cup size....cup size was alright, but the underwire was too narrow AND the underwire that came up between the boobs was too wide!  It was like pulling my boobs apart from the center!  No thanks!  Plus, it pushed really hard into my sternum!  The material was super scratchy and uncomfortable, I just wished this worked out b/c from the picture it looks so pretty but the material is awful."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These Skimp Skamp Briefs are the most comfortable undies I've ever worn, and I've been buying them for a long, long time. They're perfect for anyone who doesn't like bikini or high-rise panties. After three babies, I can't wear those things anymore. The fabric moves with you, and they're practically invisible under clothing. I add Oxi-Clean to the detergent when I wash them, as chlorine bleach does a number on them. Plus I use a hanger with clips to air-dry them on the shower rod, as they last longer that way."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was debating between a 1 and 2 star rating.  These Jockey briefs are good quality, but Jockey has a sizing problem between sizes 7 and 8.  I first ordered 3 size 8s and they are somewhat large so went back on Amazon, checked the sizing charts then ordered 3 size 7s.  There is at least 2 or more inches difference in the width of these two sizes and the 7 is more than an inch shorter.  I can't complain about the quality of Jockey, but sizing is a totally separate issue.  The size 7s will be donated to Goodwill ASAP."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Apparently, Jockey makes different styles of underwear for sale in stores and online in packages.  I got what I thought looked identical to ones I got at JCPenney--every detail was the same, the fiber contents were the same--and when I got them, they were not the same.  They do fit pretty well--but not as well as the others I have.  They are not soft and silky and stretchy like the ones I got at the store.  They are really thick, and so a little hot for summer and they don't have a lot of stretch."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love simple white underwear.  Easy to wash, easy to bleach to get that nice clean look.  Cotton is breathable and comfortable.  This design has the nice french cut, which means they go higher up on your thigh. I buy a new 3 pack about once a quarter.  I use the more worn pairs when I go on vacation or on a business trip, and then just throw them away instead of having to come home and wash them...:)These are not the most longest lasting underwear ever, but I sure like them right out of the package.  Which is important.  If you have to wash them for weeks before you like them, what a waste!Nothing fancy or sexy about these, but they are quality and comfortable."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I found these to be a bit smaller than store brands like Hanes and Fruit of the Loom. I do like the style though. My one big problem with these panties is that they are perfumed. Seriously, whose idea was it to scent women's underwear?? Why is this necessary? Jockey, do you also scent men's underwear, or are women just particularly stinky? And why would they think we would like it?? I've washed them 3 times now, soaked them overnight in a borax and vinegar mixture, and they still smell. I'm worried that I could get a UTI from the scent if I wear them. As long as they keep using perfume in their underwear, I will not purchase Jockey panties again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My 11-year old daughter is 5' 2&#34; and weighs 103 lbs.  She's straight as a board and doesn't have much of a butt.  However, these size 4 fit her very well.  I was concerned, since I ordered online and couldn't hold them up to put my eyes on them before I bought them.  She really likes the prints and when she tried them on she said they felt more like a bathing suit bottom.  That's good, since bathing suits need to fit your body kind of tight.  They're Jockey, so they're made of great quality!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have shopped at many bra shops in the US and Europe. If you are a 38G and short-waisted this bra is the one for you. I have paid over a hundred dollars in Houston for this bra, so to find it between forty and fifty dollars on Amazon is great.  The bras are from England and the quality is excellent. The material the bra is made from never breaks down, it is the wire poking thru that signals that the bra is dead. When this happens I get out my sewing machine, fix the area and use it for another year or so. Even at one hundred dollars Fantasie bras are worth the price!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm really impressed with these shimmers pantyhose tights . They're warm and durable like tights but have a really sexy semi sheer, shimmery look to them like luxury pantyhose. .Great to wear with a mini and heels to really show off  your legs and they'll still keep you  warm.They  fit fantastic and are very comfortable to wear for long days.They also give your legs support,  feels like you wearing leggs sheer energy pantyhose . I've  tried a lot of  tights and these are one of the best and the price is reasonable.Love them!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought my first pair about four years ago and was quite pleased with them.  They are like a heavy duty control top panyhose but they really lift and tuck the goopy stuff.Recently while trying on some new skirts I turned around and was dismayed at what appeared in the mirror!  Horrors!  My butt has gone south, but not to worry, I tried the said skirts on with my Spanx and that solved my problem.  Now the twins back there look nice and perky...well, not like when I was 16, but maybe when I was a 33 year old dance teacher.The waist and thighs stay in place, no rolling there.  Even though I'm a size 2 it does take a little more \"work\" to get these babies on. But once they are in place, wow!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "at first, I was a bit wary about buying them since I have thick thighs & worried that it'd cut into my legs & you'd totally be able to tell I'm wearing them. nope, not with these. I love them. they slim down my legs & love handles enough so I can wear a size lower than what I'd wear without them. easy to manage & they don't really roll down on the top unless I'm hunched over. I just have to make sure that they're pulled down far enough on my legs so they don't make any marks. (size 11/12 jean)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "You can't beat the quality of Spanx as long as you accept that you MUST order two sizes larger than the chart says you need. You will never get them on otherwise. (And if you do get them on, you'll be miserable.) Order two sizes up and they'll still be snug and hold down the jiggles. You'll feel confident and comfortable. These are perfect under skirts to keep you cool and prevent thighs from rubbing together. They also keep the skirt from sticking to your behind after you've been sitting. They're still a challenge to get on - especially after using a public restroom where you don't have a lot of room. Also, I can see where they'd be easy to snag with a rough fingernail or ring, so be careful. I really wish they'd make them in more sizes for larger bodies, but overall, they are awesome and worth the price."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Comfortable, stout, quality underwear. The pocket seems to let heat rise which is handy. They nearly reach your belly button -- which makes them great choices when you don't want to tuck in your shirt (they protect your waist from rough jeans).After a month and four wash/wear cycles (hot water wash and high heat dry for \"super-sterilization-ish-ness\") they are still going strong. :)Munslingers, my old brand, have gone down in quality (i've thrown out brand new ones -- I can't in good conscience return worn underwear); stretched out elastic, no support, too loose or too tight elastic (one leg hole might be tight, the other leg hole too loose -- really horrible situations that make 'em unwearable).I expect to buy only these Jockeys for many many years."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I know how long they lasted because my Amazon purchase history shows when I bought the last pair, on 11/27/10.  I know they lasted more than 2,000 miles because  I always wore these shoes when I walked my dog and that was twice a day, one mile each time.  I wore them on other occasions as well and figured I would go with the most conservative values which to me are still pretty impressive.After all this the soles started to wear, I figured it was time to get a replacement &#34;dog walking shoe&#34; and ordered the same shoe again.  The size, 12W, was dead on and the shoes are as comfortable as before.  They are still light, and have an effective tread without looking clunky."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These shoes are probably the most comfortable I own.  I'd been thinking about getting a pair for years because of all the positive reviews so I finally pulled the trigger.  Good call, because they are super comfy and easy to slip on and off.  On the downside though they are black seude shoes.  I must not have looked closely enough because I thought they were just black leather.  I suppose I just don't see myself as the type of guy that wears seude shoes.  I power through it though because these things are so comfortable.  They'll work great for casual wear in the winter/fall, but come summer spring I don't see myself sporting these shoes with shorts.  They really only work with jeans.Fit was as expected, unlike Keens that usually need a 1/2 size bigger."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've owned a bunch of Merrells, mostly of the &#34;moc&#34; variety.  Nothing negative on this particular model, though I can't yet comment on durability.  However, past Merrells have held up nicely; the outsoles always wear down smooth long before the uppers are ready to pack it in.  The one thing I notice with this model is that the sizing seems to run a tad larger than my other Merrell mocs -- I ordered the same size I always have, but this pair fit a smidge looser than I expected.  Without a comparison, I can't say if a 1/2 size smaller would fit better."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Merrell's WERE great, perhaps when they were made in Canada. These are identical in stated sizing to a wonderful pair of Merrell Jungle Moc's I wore comfortably in and out of the house for years, but my heel slipped a lot in these, there was way too much toe room, and they seemed 1/2 to 1 size too large. I wear a 9.5 US Merrell but these felt like 10-10.5's. I had to return them for properly fitting and comfortable Teva's. I do not recommend these, I would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Ten years ago, my husband bought a pair of these Merrell shoes locally.  They were the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn.  Now (10 years later), after wearing these shoes on a daily basis, they have finally bit the dust.  We bought the same version from Amazon to replace his old Jungle Slip-on's, and the new ones are just as comfortable.  Out of the box, there's no break-in period needed -- he can wear them all day, with nary a blister."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Merrells for a while and highly suggest them for anyone that has trouble finding comfortable shoes. I must say that I prefer the Jungle Moc Nubuck, Brown Nubuck but it seems that the Brown Nubuck  are being discontinued for the present time and it's hard to find the Brown Nubuck. I decided to try Men's Merrell Jungle Moc Leather, Mahogany Brown and was very satisfied with every thing but the color. The Merrell Jungle Moc Leather, Mahogany Brown is not mahogany at all, not even close but rather a tan looking color. Beware that the Mahogany Brown as shown in the picture is not the correct color. It is a very light brown or tan colored shoe. I almost sent them back but the return time frame closed on me. If you like a lighter colored shoe this is a great and comfortable shoe. I do like the new sole on this shoe. It has a better grip support sole that the older Merrells. It is made of all smooth leather and not suede like most other Merrells."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This shoe is extremely comfortable, looks good and is convenient.  Slips on and slips off.  No laces to tie or untie.  Really great for traveling and going thru those irritating TSA checkpoints at the airports.  The seller however I can not recommend.  When I orderd my Merrells, the seller had them listed as in stock, yet it took two emails...the second one threatening cancellation to finally get them shipped two weeks later.  BTW...this is my second pair.  The first pair were bought for me at a Merrell Store in Birmingham, Alabama and they are still going strong.  Just wanted another color."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So the arches are really hard and pronounced, and they are not the same on each foot, another reviewer said he had a defective left shoe, well I think I got the matching right side.  I've been trying to stick it out for a week, even directly putting my heel and all my weight on the arch to try and \"break it in\" but it's not budging and I'm going to end up limping if I try to keep it up. The first day I wore them, it took me a couple of days for my arch to recover, I thought I had just hit it wrong or something.The styling and design of the shoe is great, so it is disappointing that it is not comfortable, I really wanted to like these shoes, I guess I'll see if I can send them back because they are defective."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This was purchased for my 4 year old to wear when we took him to see the new Superman movie. The quality is what you would expect from a packaged halloween costume that is meant to be worn for one day. The S on the chest started peeling on one corner after a few days of wear. My son is obsessed with super heros so he wears this costume around the house almost daily. The stitching for the velcro on the belt came loose and had to be repaired. For the price I paid for this, we have got our money's worth out if it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this for my 5 year old grandson and he couldn't have been happier!  I picked this one because it isn't padded in the chest.  I wanted the costume to be comfortable since my grandson likes to wear his costume day and night.  I actually ordered both the medium and the small.  The sizing on the package of the small said ages 3-4.  That made me uncertain if it would fit since my grandson is tall for his age.  Just to be safe I ordered the medium too. It turned out the small was a perfect fit with room to grow so I returned the medium which was too big. If your child loves to dress up, I'm sure this will be a hit!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "We wanted the costume that didn't have all the bulk in it.  This was perfect.  My son is 4 and it was a little big, but I just think- hey, he can wear it to play in for a good year or so.  He'll get lots of wear out of this.  It would be nice if the boot covers fit tighter, but they were good enough! Easy on and off...we actually had a whole outfit on under it to keep warm, so there's your muscle bulk, if that's what you want."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Easily my favorite sandals I've ever owned. I've had them for almost three years now, and I still wear them and they haven't worn out yet. I would definitely buy them again. The only thing you need to know is that those run a little smaller than usual. My shoes size usually is a 10.5-11 depending on the brand and the 9.5-10.5 fits perfectly. It was a little hard to get used to it in the beginning since it molds to one's feet, but as soon as that happened, it was the most comfortable pair of sandals I've ever owned!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I had a pair of Reebok Hi-Top sneakers years ago and wore them to threads.  I hadn't seen any locally and had basically given up, until stumbling upon them on Amazon.  I was delighted to get another pair.I remembered, and I'm glad I did, that these shoes run on the small and narrow side.  I normally wear a size 9, but went up a half size to 9.5.  And, they fit perfectly, with room for a light, gel type orthopedic insert, which I think is necessary because the footbed is not very cushioned.  There is moderate arch support.I know many younger folks like Hi-Tops as a fashion statement.  I really like them for the ankle support, particularly with this shoe because the double velcro straps provide for necessary adjustments for perfect comfort.These shoes are a blast from the past.  I may have to spring for a pair in black for the upcoming fall/winter."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I use to love these in the '80's but hi-tops became obsolete.  Glad I could find some because in the hot summer I hate wearing my ankle braces as they make my feet sweat too much and constrict my blood flow making my feet and ankles swell.  Anyway, although I haven't worn these out of the house yet, I'm sure they will work well for me provided I still use my cane.  I will admit in reading the other reviews, they do run narrow which was fine with me and the length was perfect.  Nicely made too."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This jacket is warm in the winter and very rugged and will last many years under heavy use (construction).This jacket is very stiff and can be restrictive. The back of this longer below waist line jacket can ride up after driving and create folds in the back.I had a shorter length Carhart with stretch strip material at the bottom and built in hood. It didnt look as good as this one but it was much more comfortable after being washed several times and lasted years with heavy use.If you buy this jacket, wash it first thing to loosen it up a little bit.I strongly recommend Carhart clothing, but there is compromise with comfort for long wear and warmth.My recommendation is this jacket below:http://www.amazon.com/Carhartt-Mens-Duck-Active-Thermal-Lined/dp/B002WLOK1U/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&s;=apparel&qlEnable;=1&qid;=1284079028&sr;=1-16"}

We live in Boston, so the jacket is very warm and fits its purpose, the only problem is that is very, very big, i think i got him the medium one and it fits like a large one, it's very bulky too, but as i said, if you are looking for something warm, go for this one but maybe a size less.Nice color and it's cool that it has inside pockets, at least that's what my fiance says :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just received these socks yesterday. So I went for a long walk today. 5 miles out in the country. The socks felt great in my walking shoes. I had to kind of rush for the last 2 miles to get home for my son, so I put the speed on. The socks even felt good at a good clip. They are nice and soft and cushy, yet they do not feel bunchy in the shoes. Overall a great sock. I will try them with hiking boots as soon as I can."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The wife went for an Mt Everest Base Camp trek, from Lukla to EBC and back to Lukla- 11 days. The problem was the weight allowed was only 8KG (about 17 lbs) for the porters carry, therefore even extra pairs of socks were a bad item to haul. She carried 4 pairs of these socks and they did an amazing job of keeping her feet clear of all the sweat and ensured that she suffered no blisters doing about 8-9 hours of walking at that altitude.She wears shoes- Timberlands 7.5M and Reeboks US 9.5- probably due to the differences in widths. These socks fit upto US 9.5 for men perfect, and if you are 10+ then these may not be for you.All in all, she recommends this for any prolonged wear and for closed shoes, unlike track/sports shoes, where ventilation could be in issue. Absolute recommended buy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Women's size 11 shoe size here (Men's 9 1/2) and I ordered the large.  Could not be happier!  I love the padding, and the comfort in terms of temperature and moisture.  I have a foot injury, and I need support and cushioning for my toes and the ball of my foot- these socks are perfect.  They are very thick- so make sure your shoes can accommodate them- but aside from that caveat, these should not give you any trouble, and at least for my shoe size, the fit was perfection."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "It's been a long, cold winter here in the Northeast and I needed to add a couple of more thermal undershipts to my wardrobe.There are more expensive brands than Carhart and maybe they are more \"fashionable\". However, when it comes to keeping me warm and lasting for years, I've never found a better brand.If I do have one minor complaint it's that the sleeves are too long. Granted, I'm only 5'8\", but the sleeves are long enough for guys playing in the NBA."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These socks are absolutely amazing, and I cannot believe how much better my feet feel after long walks or workouts with wearing them.  They make all of the difference in the world.I learned about the Cool Max sox from reading Leslie Sansone's book, and decided I should use all of the research that the US Army put into finding which socks held up well for soldiers in the field.  These are for walking workouts, and have excellent cushioning just where you need it, plus they wick away moisture.Your feet will love you for getting these!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "A T-shirt may be \"only a T-shirt\" to some, but when you want a roomy shirt with generous proportions and substantial materials -- the all-cotton shirt is a bit heftier than run-of-the-mill T's -- this Carhartt shirt does the job. The armholes allow easy motion, and the body of the tall-sized shirt is longer than the norm of tall sizes from other manufacturers. Both features ensure all-day comfort for the active wearer. This holds for work and play duties alike. The only quibble: There's a small, cheesy (cheap-looking) manufacturer label on the front of the breast pocket. There are a lot of other ways and places to put a brand's name on a garment."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "There are the heaviest and best work and all around pocket t shirts . I like I can get tall sizes that never show a plumbers crack and tuck in well keeping in warmth  . The long sleeves ones are great to layer in winter . The material is almost as heavy as tent canvas but soft as it is cotton . They are generous to size but do order your regular one because air pockets are good insulators as well as aid in wicking moisture and drying  . They shrink a tad . Carhartt's are absolutely the best but you do have to pay up for them . They are worth it . If a thinner material will do I will try other quality brands like Key's or St Johns Bay if their on sale but truth be told the Carhartt's are best . They stain less and the same goes for other wear and tear. I have found it is better to not use bleach when washing these .Good luck"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Have purchased Carhartt for years and recently have noticed the fit and the crew ribbing at neck have not been uniform. Different locations where made all have different issues. Purchase in question, color spinach is stamped &#34;original fit&#34;. No others have this and this fits the most different. Am comparing this to what I considered original fit when the product had tags. These are sized uniformly and the ribbed neck have held their shape after many washings. I've purchased the 6.75 oz. only when stated, when no mention of weight assume their not. Am not a happy camper."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been buying Carhartt work wear for my husband for over 20 years. I have always been happy with their quality. These  tees are cut so thin that they were tight on my 6'2&#34; hubby who weighs 160 pounds. I bought the Medium because that is the size he always wears in Carhartt. Unfortunately, I was expecting the same quality as other products that I have purchased from them. I washed them before he wore them so I ended up throwing them out! I will be looking for another work clothes manufacturer. The muscle tees are also cut too thin."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have 4 of these t-shirts, 2 henleys and 1 lightweight t-shirt. Love them all. They look great, wear well and are as comfortable as any shirt you will own. The quality of the shirt is much higher than the 4-7 dollar t-shirts you will get at Wally World....these cost more but will last for years even with regular use and washing.--Beware of sizing, as many have already said, they run bigger....I wear an XL in EVERY other shirt I have but for these I wear a large. I am 6 ft tall, 225 lbs with broad shoulders and a 46 inch chest.Overall I LOVE these shirts!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Once my Dickies shirts had prematurely worn out, I made the decision to switch to another brand. Carhartt was the first one to come to mind. They were a considerable investment for tshirts, but I have always felt that quality is worth the price.I was initially pleased with the thickness, fit and color selection of these t's. However, in just three months of wear the colors unevenly faded across the shirts and holes/wear marks started to show around the collar areas. The tan, red and gray shirts showed these flaws more than the navy, white and black shirts did.At 6 foot 2 inches and 225lbs, I wear an XL in other tshirts. This was not the case in Carhartt. They run big. I found that the L tall fit me perfectly.These tshirts did keep their shape and size characteristics after several washings, but based on the problems that I experienced and the hefty price tag, I can not recommend these to anyone."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband is 3x type guy that works in cold areas on ocassion.  He's purchased carhartts for more than 30 years and knows they always run small so he opted for 2 sizes bigger than normal in the insulated bibs and,as it turns out, the largest size carhartt offers.  Sadly they were still at least 2 sizes too small!  He was soooo disappointed to have to return these and purchase an brand other than carhartt.  Wish Carhartt would review their sizing and offer a bit more of the larger sizes AND more accurate sizing information.As I said... sadly, these were returned.  :("}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Too often pants today are low-risers - even male pants and/or pants designed for &#34;adults&#34;.  I was tired of even my normal Levi's brand shifting to this style where I feel like either my shirt is coming untucked or I'm about to get a draft down my butt.  Fed up, I ran across of pair of Carhartt jeans.  These pants fit exactly like my old style USED TO and looks great.  The denim is also soft - unlike my memory of Carhartt jeans from my youth being the pants of choice for outdoor work (hard and durable and scratchy).Very happy with my now two pairs of Carhartts - plan to stay with this brand for now on!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn Levi 501 jeans for years but were always annoyed by the waist height aspect of the fit, and weakness in certain seams. Ditto on most brands of khakis, the office rat's jeans.  After purchasing a couple pairs of Carhartt's excellent khakis, I decided to try their jeans.  I have never before had a better fit in a pair of jeans,or a more correct sizing of the waist and inseam.  They are so comfortable my wife has to steal them away to wash them, so I got more of them. I have several Carhartt products and I can assure you they are made for maximum durabilty, value and comfort for the working man.  The relaxed fit version is especially comfortable on horseback because it allows your legs to move without pulling down the waist.  Best ever jeans!!And the best source I found for price and prompt delivery was Amazon.  If they say they have it, you get it quick and well packed."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These jeans are the best on the market for the money. Compared to wrangler and levi the fit and finish is miles above. I usually rip out belt loops in the first week of owning jeans and these carhartts are holding up better than any before. I love carhartt shirts and now their jeans. Wont buy anything else.Side note, these jeans fit very tight. If you are looking for a wrangler type regular fit, get the relaxed fit carhartt jeans.**EDIT** these jeans fit really oddly. super tight in the hips and butt but loose in the thigh and knees. They taper down really tightly onto boots. Also, I can see through the fabric in the seat of the jeans. They have no ripped but i am keeping an eye on them. Belt loops are holding strong."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband is extremely picky and hard to please.  He needed new jeans but has been disapointed with the quality of Levi's brand.  I knew Carhartt makes tough work clothes and outerwear that lasts, so I asked him to try these.  I bought 2 pair and awaited delivery.  My husband loves them.  They fit perfectly in the waist and length.  I have washed them since purchase and they have not shrunk or faded.  I plan to buy more when I need to from Carhartt since he is happy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So I bought a pair because I remember having a pair years back that looked really nice and were quite comfortable. This style has back pockets spaced wider apart than I remember - somewhat similar to Wrangler 13MWZ &#34;cowboy pants&#34;.Contrary to popular opinion, Wrangler butts don't always drive them nuts. My girlfriend doesn't like the look so much. I had ditched two pairs of 13MWZ for the same reason.I will keep them because, well, I am too lazy to send them back and they are very comfortable."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Bought a pair of 33x30. I think they fit like 28x30. Like 3&#34; short of snapping.I bought these because I am tired of paying a lot for Levies and never knowing where I am getting a good price or a horrible price. Also, what model, etc.FYI - My wife did not like these. Thought they looked very very boring. Old man pants.Liked:- Quality made or so in my opinion in the 10 min I looked at them and tried them on.Disliked:- About 5 sizes too small. Not sure why. I checked the inside label to be sure.- They are a bit old man looking. More so than I could tell from the online pic."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Tried the rest and buying again the best.My previous pair of World Tour Classic was 14 XW, but Rockport stopped making extra wide in size 14.So, I risked and ordered 14 W. It's the winner! Still not tight and good support from the bottom.Rockport World Tour Classic makes the most comfortable and durable shoes I've ever owned.My previous pair of the same lasted for almost 7 years. Still looks good. The bottom is getting worn out though, but what do you want from a 7 year old shoes.Tried a few pairs of Dunham because they make size 14 4E, but they were completely uncomfortable (the platform is almost not bendable). Those went back.Thinking of buying a different color of the same shoes now.Wear them to work and whenever else have to wear the pants."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I actually take an E width in a shoe but decided to try these in the 9.5D.  They are a little tight across the top of foot which was expected as even EE boots are tight there.  I will use a form stretcher at the spot and they will feel fine.  I found these on a closeout at a fantastic price via Wholesale Deals so could not pass them up.  GREAT SHOE at a GREAT PRICE!  On top of this they were received within three days.  &#34;THANKS AGAIN AMAZON&#34; for a great deal."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've worn Rockport brand for many years and I've purchased more than a few pair of these very shoes.  However, when I purchased this most recent pair of the World Tour Classic,  the decline in quality workmanship was very noticeable. The shoes are now made in Vietnam and the look of inferior materials is very obvious on this shoe. The logos and Rockport brands are still in the same place, but \"made made materials\" (cheap plastic?) has replaced what used to be leather.  Very disappointing for a $ 100 shoe.  What has happened to what was once a good company?"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These shoes have the most inferior insole of any walking shoe. If you want to add a decent insole, you won't have much breathing room for your foot. The shoes overall aren't as comfortable as everybody is saying, but I have a slightly wide foot. I am fine when I wear my New Balance shoes with a width of D. I do believe that this shoe isn't what it used to be. They are a decent pair of shoes for someone on a budget. I bought theRockport Men's Ct Sport Oxfordwhen I bought these, and highly suggest those. Those shoes have a much better insole, and the shoe breathes well."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These Rockports are very much like well-made, socially-acceptable versions of athletic shoes.  They are very flexible, take no time to break in, provide good traction, and look almost like a pair of dress oxfords.  Because they are nicely padded -- which adds to the comfort -- they tend to look a little blocky, so that they're probably not your cup of tea if you're looking for stylish dress shoes.  But for going on a cruise -- where you want to wear a single pair of your size 13 shoes and not have to pack extras, and will be walking a lot -- these are wonderful."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "We bought a pair for an older child who wore out lesser, cheaper brands in a few months. With one brand we had trouble with the rubber sole separating from the rest of the sandal. Sometimes you could fix it with Shoe Goo, sometimes not. I recognized Columbia as a good brand and bought a pair on the large side, since he is still growing. So far we're doing fine. One can tell by inspection it is a much better sandal than sandals selling for half the price. So, though it is more expensive than some other brands at department stores, I think this is a good value in the long run. Comfortable and attractive, too."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Haven't had them too long but the quality seems great for the price.  The grip on the bottom is really good, but its a hard material so they seem like they wont wear out fast or hurt your feet when you step on a sharp rock.  The stitching, velcro and straps all seem very good. Most comfortable sandals Ive had yet, the rubber you step on is squishy. They also have a lip in the front which helps protect your toes and keep them planted in the sandal. I ordered a 13 and they seem very true to size. hope they last!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was going whitewater rafting for my bachelor party and wanted sandals I could wear in the river. I also wanted them to last. I turned to Columbia. The sandals are decently comfortable, but take some breaking in. Expect a sore foot the first 3-5 wears.The sizing was accurate and I did not feel that they were too big or too small.The only problem I had (well two...) was that they did not stay on very well in the river. The front strap kept being pulled over my toes so my foot was resting on top of the front strap. This was rather inconvenient while trying to prevent yourself from drowning in raging rapids. The second is my wife hates them and thinks they make me look like a computer nerd - if only I wore socks with them.The water had no ill-effects on the material."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this Texsport bag to store myGuide Gear Double Wigwam Tent.  This bag is huge and is big enough for my 8-man tent with room to spare.  The only thing I don't like is it doesn't come with a strap.  There are plastic loops where we can attach a strap, but we must supply our own straps.  It does come with carry handles and a zipper down the middle, which I like more than the ones that open on the end.This is one tough bag.  Great for camping.  I'm glad I found it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband loved these when he first put them on and continued to love them - except that after they were washed, they turned a funny color. They are no longer brown. Instead they look like they were washed with something that bled into the brown threads and I guess it was the dark fleece lining that did it...because the pants were washed alone. They are still wearable. They just look a little odd now. But for around the house and yard, walking dogs, hunting - they'll be fine."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold, they are still quite affordable.The stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything.  They stand out on the lobe and I was worried they'd be really small, but they are not.  In spite of the decent size of the stones, these are really lightweight and you can't tell you're wearing them, at all.I think these would make an excellent gift and I'm considering buying an additional pair, just for that purpose!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Of all the earrings I received for Christmas these were my favorite. Maybe because I bought them for myself. Nice, simple and smallish gold hoops. They are not as big as you would expect judging by the picture shown. After doing a little research on duragold (because really, what is it?) it appears to have a slightly lower percentage of gold in it and reportedly the strongest gold alloy ever. Whatever that is. Still, I love these except the post is a little long and gets caught on my clothes. I'd buy them again and I would buy them as a gift."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These 14K gold hoops are about the diameter of a dime  1/2 inch, and the width is about 1/4 inch.  The hoops seem sturdy, the catch looks fragile.  I did wear them for a week nonstop and they never came undone.  But I imagine taking them on and off repeatedly might eventually be an issue with the fragile looking catch.  These would be great for a child, and good for a women when she doesn't want a large hoop.  These have a post that sticks out a bit in the back, so they are not as comfortable as a hoop where the clasp goes inside the hoop. But it wasn't nearly  as uncomfortable as a butterfly back post because the post tends to hang downward rather than poking  straight back. They have a polish finish, and are a good choice for a small unobtrusive but substantial looking earring."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love these hoops! They are so comfortable to wear and are a nice size if you want a hoop but don't want the dangers of catching them on anything.They were a bit smaller than I thought they would be, but once I put them on, I was hooked. I have short hair so they are visible regardless. If you have longer hair, these earring might be hidden.I'm glad I stumbled upon these - quite by accident. They are a replacement pair for ones my husband bought me that were almost 2\" across and made me look like DUMBO.The earrings are packaged nicely too. They come in a nice pouch with a authenticity tag.I highly recommend these earrings. Buy with confidence."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband purchased these for me to match a white gold necklace.  I wear them 95% of the time.  I sleep in them.  They are very small, but that's what I like about them.  They're dainty.  The latch is still working well, even though I shower in them and sleep in them.  I change them rarely, as they match the necklace which is sentimental to me.  I had meant to get some more white gold earrings and just haven't.  These have stood the test of time... even though I didn't mean to challenge them that way."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "When I received these, they looked like good quality and the latch looked secure. I wore them to work (I have a desk job) and lost one the first day. Fortunately for me, the cleaning lady helped me look for it and managed to find it on the floor in the office. Now I'm scared to wear them again. I have another pair of sterling silver hoops that have this same type of latch. I've worn them for years, and they've never fallen out of my ears. I can't help but be disappointment with a pair of earrings when one falls out of my ear on the first day, especially when I did not do anything to cause it to fall out."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The reviews on these earrings were so mixed that I wasn't sure I was going to be happy when I received them. I'm pleased to say I was not unpleasantly surprised.They are flimsy, they're very light, they don't seem overly trustworthy, but they're very pretty AND under $150. If you're looking for solid heavy gold hoops that will last a lifetime, you need to visit your jeweler and be prepared to invest. If you want a delicate pair of chic hoops that will fill a hole in your jewelry box for less than the cost of a nice dinner out, these are for you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm & 6mm sizes.  I was happy with all, but not with this 6mm size.  These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner.  While they look good, the posts are too short and very slippery, also the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily.  I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost).  Otherwise, they would have been fine.  I returned them and would not buy this pair again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased these on a gold box whim.  They are larger than I expected, and the rose color is not really discernible.  They look yellow gold to me.Yes, I'll probably keep them and no, I wouldn't recommend them to others.  They are much too large for second ear piercings.  They aren't the style I usually wear.  So far, the backs have securely held them in each ear and the posts are reasonable diameter.  They appear to be adequately made, but don't really look like high quality earrings."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These earrings are really pretty.  They look exactly like the picture on Amazon.  I got these on a Lightning Deal for $40, which I thought was a good price for gold earrings.  Unlike some reviewers, I like the 8mm size.  It is big enough to be seen clearly, without being too big to overpower the look.  I bought these earrings to match/coordinate with the Duragold 14k yellow gold beaded ball necklace.  They match perfectly.  So glad I got these.  If you are looking for a simple and classic look, then I would definitely recommend these earrings."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are such a great size, are nice and shiny, and have a good weight to them.  I'm super happy with this purchase.  However, the backs are completely useless.  They just slide on and off, up and down the post--there is no catch whatsoever.  So I'm disappointed that I'm going to have to spend the time, money and effort to pick up replacement backs, but I expected this based on some of the other reviews.  So don't hesitate to buy these since they are great quality and a good value, but do plan to replace the backs before you wear them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got these as a gift for myself, great quality, sturdy, comfortable to wear, I don't even feel they're there! They're a bit bigger than I expected, maybe next time I'll go for the smaller thicker ones on offer here at Amazon (if they go on sale! hint hint!) Even with my long curly hair they show. I'm very satisfied.Update: More than a year later and these earrings are perfect, I even sleep with them. They get mega abuse and they're still going strong."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I started wearing this type New Balance slide-on about 10 years ago during a bout of plantar fasciitis.  I was advised to a) wear only New Balance shoes and b) don't take even a single step barefoot.  For months I wore New Balance running shoes to work and I used these slip-ons as bedroom slippers.  Well, eventually my feet felt better and I could wear normal shoes to the office, but I have continued to wear these shoes as my slippers and house shoes and go-get-the-newspaper shoes.  Sometimes I also run errands in them.  They are versatile, comfortable, and supportive.  Because of the little lip at the heel your foot is held in the shoe so they don't slide off like a lot of clogs.  I love these shoes and wouldn't be without a pair."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased these based on the wonderful reviews, I have a black pair from Sketchers that I loved that I figured would be similar..not really.  These just putting them on, HURT, I had to jam my feet in them (due to that non moving elastic (?) piece on the top where the laces would be) to get them in.  I can't really walk comfortable but am hoping that maybe they need time to stretch?  I don't have wide feet and never needed any special type of shoe but these were really tight across the top!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these New Balance mules for around-the-house wear because they slip off easily when I need to go outside to work in the garden, however, they are so comfortable I find myself wearing them for shopping and other social activities as well.They are attractive--look great with jeans and cutoffs--and most important, my heel stays in the shoe. They run true to size. I wear a 9 medium and these in that size fit perfectly. I wish I had them in several colors. I may never go back to lace-up shoes again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am an adult woman who chose this watch to wear.  It has several features that I wanted.  The elastic band is far more comfortable than a metal expansion band and is the most comfortable type of band I've ever worn.  The watch is light weight, has numbers big enough for me to read without my putting on my glasses, and the dial lights up with a push of the button.  The only thing I don't like is that the second hands are lizards and do not allow from exact tracking.  They seem to be mainly for cuteness."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "when I first bought it I was afraid he wouldn't like it, since it wasn't Iron man, or anything of that sort. But he was so excited that he made me write down the table chart for multiples of fives for the living room so he can reference it and find the time. The watch also is glow in the dark! which i didn't know. and its waterproof....he still hasn't taken it off. He said &#34;my daddy has a watch, and now I have a watch. Mine is better though because I have lizards.&#34;"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My four year old had just gotten a watch and then my three year old decided he needed to wear a watch also.  He loves animals! This was the best one I saw. It is a fabric wrist band so it was easy to size to his very small wrist. Band is too long for him but I tuck it under and it stays fine that way. Doesn't poke or itch him and now he wears it to school like his brother and shows his friends. Of course he can't tell time but oh well he feels like a big boy.  It lights up when you push in the button, which is the second thing he shows people after he announcing it has lizards on it.  Arrived quickly from seller :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is the perfect watch!! I have been searching for a watch for my 4 year old son and this turned out to be the best we've found.  I saw some other timex watches but I guess they were a junior size, this size is perfect for my son's tiny wrist, it adjusts perfect and has a lot of length on the wrist so it can fit when he grows up.  The first thing we did with this watch was to go to the pool, my son wore it during a whole day of swimming and playing at the pool and it worked perfectly, it even has a light that he loves, the little geckos are cute, I would definitely recomend this watch...we really love it, and the price is perfect!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My daughter's wanted watches and we wanted them to be able to tell time on an analog clock....something that most teens and many adults we know do not know how to do. We love these and so do our girls!! I bought one for both my daughters for Christmas (age 6 and 9). Both can tell time with it like champs and I only had to explain how it worked once! The bands are comfortable and fully adjustable so they fit even my youngest securely! It is also soft enough that it doesn't bother my youngest daughter's eczema that is always an issue at her wrists :) My girls are excited still (5 months later) every time they get to tell somebody what time it is :) Everyone is very happy!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These 501's were exactly what I was seeking for my son, though they can be purchased in W.A. the different washes are not available. I really wanted the 'Rigids' and they are not here. To find I could buy them on 'Amazon' but shipping outside of 'US' was not available, was really OFF!So many things in the last 4 months are not available for shipping outside the 'US'. It sometimes takes a long time to find everything and it's not until one checks out to discover the item-s are not available for shipping.What can I say."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am 57 and have been wearing these jeans since high school..I started out a 30/30..I am currently a 33/30..While my size has not changed all that much these jeans have...They were one of the oldest American companies and it is sad to see the denegration of an icon..Hell years ago these pants were used as a sobriety check..If you couldn't handle the buttons  on the rest room call you knew you had drank to much..Zippers were for sissy's! In summation don't expect quality anymore however if you need a sobriety check these will still fit that bill.."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Well, these are definitely better than the 505's I bought a few months ago, but they're still not the Levi's jeans of a few years ago.  Compared to the 505's, these actually sit at the waist and are sized correctly.  The 501's also use a heavier denim than the 505's, 550's, etc.  The button fly was not my first choice, but this way I don't have to deal with the cheap zipper used in the current 505's.  Did I mention that Levi's are not the same quality product they were just a few short years ago?  The biggest difference between these 501's and the legacy 501's (and all other styles of Levi's jeans) is the missing belt loops.  There used to be 2 additional loops in the back, between the center loop and the 2 side loops.  Somehow they just don't feel right without those other 2 loops."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Don't be as stupid as the Levi Corporation.  Although Levi jeans manufactured in the 1950's sell for thousands of dollars in New York, the company has relentlessly degraded the product for 40 years now, trading on their name alone.  They are actually so stupid as to try to compete with the slaves in a Chinese concentration camp by accepting products manufactured in Africa and South America.  The original rivets are gone, their \"denim\" fabric is the worst quality; all seams fray, especially cuffs; belt loops fall apart; and the only appearance achieved is shabby tissue.  These fools do not have the intelligence to realize that people would pay hundreds of dollars for jeans produced on the design, material, and workmanship of the 1940's. Stop living in the past."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Of course it's nice when things change for the better and just as sweet when the small close to perfect things in life remain unchanged by time. This is the case with these Levi's 501 jeans.For decades my favorite jeans of all time. Countless designers and brands have tried to tap into the 501's iconic popularity but at the end of the day have always failed to do so.These are exactly how I remember them:* Heavy Denim* Re-enforced flawless stitching on all pockets, hems, waist line and inner leg.* Solid brass rivets on pockets* The classic brass rivet button flyOrdered in white these arrived quickly, wrapped in plastic with tags of authenticity. The fit and feel is marvelous and the price is sensational. Macy's and other stores sell 501's for twice this amount. The slim fit isn't constrictive nor are they pre-washed so expect a few washings before they feel like a second skin.Highest Recommendation!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Levi's 501 jeans for literally half a century and the quality of the fabric has gone downhill to the point where a pair now lasts me less than a year before tears appear. I know that the stone wash type are actually tumbled with rocks and are not going to wear very long but I do expect the standard jeans to last a lot longer than a matter of weeks before having holes in the jeans from the fabric having worn thin. Dislike paying 10x as much and getting 1/10 the wear of the Levi's of the past."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very nice watch. I get complements on it all the time. I paid about ~69 with prime shipping and am very pleased.(Fulfilled by Amazon at the time.)The band is smooth, no hair pulling. Very sturdy. Titanium is a wonder metal. If you break this watch your arm is probably gone too. I'm pretty rough on watches and this one is holding up well.The band system is the best. Fully adjustable across the whole length and any excess stays put hidden beneath the other half and is not noticed by look or feel. Very secure latch that took me a bit to get used to but was mainly caused by tight tolerance in manufacture. Looser now from use and perfect.Slim sharp and tough. Very nice watch."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Title says it all. (This is the third Skagen I've purchased. I like the small, light design.)Also, some reviews of these watches say that the clasp tends to undo itself too easily, but I think that the current version of the watch has corrected that problem.Good: Keeps time well, comfortable, looks great as a dress watch *** BUT I SUGGEST THAT YOU ONLY WEAR IT WITH A DARK SUIT ***Bad: I've had it for a while, and mainly use it as a dress watch, and I have had nothing to complain about so far. In terms of color coordinating, its dark band and face means that is not as versatile a dress watch as the silver Skagen, so if you are have one watch, then stick with silver."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The watch itself is great. It's very nice looking, the band is very cool and the whole thing is super light and thin. There are only two issues I have with it: First, the clasp is not very easy to use. Second, the hands don't glow in the dark.There is also no second hand, which makes it kind of hard to tell if it's working, but I don't really mind not having one.All in all, I would recommend this watch for someone that needs a basic but classy watch that doesn't get in the way of clothing or gloves."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The watch is really stylish. I wear it for casual-dressy ocassions and get compliments on it often.At the beginning I could not adjust the band (one size fits many) to fit my wrist and have it lock into place properly. Therefore I could not close the clasp when I put it on my wrist. I took it to a local jeweler to adjust properly (only charged $5). If you have difficulty also don't force it. Take it to a jeweler - you'll be happy you did.And then, the clasp mechanism itself is a bit complex - putting the watch on and taking it off is a bit tricky - it takes patience and some getting used to. After wearing it a dozen times I haven't quite mastered it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have had a Skagen 800 series watch that I liked very much. The only way to replace the band when the black starts to turn silver is to send it back to Skagen in Texas for replacement. That costs $32 and includes anything else you want done, like changing the battery. I really love the watch and felt is was worth it. However, I felt so naked without it, and they said it takes 2-3 weeks to return, that I bought another one.The diameter of this watch is smaller, it is very thin and perfect for slender wrists like mine. I love the band. You adjust it once and it stays that size forever, looks great and doesn't absorb perspiration like leather. The color is rich and reflective and goes with everything. If you like a thin watch, rather than the big bulky ones that are so popular now, this is for you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've had this watch for about a month and a half as of 9/4/06 and it has kept accurate time, I compare it to my Casio Waveceptor watch (MTG920DA-1) which calibrates itself every day.The dial is a beautiful blue color, which catches the light nicely. The easily adjusted band is comfortable, and the entire watch and band are so thin and light on my wrist.While I don't wear it every day, it has shown no signs of wear and has a good quality feel to it, though thin and light (once again).This watch will look elegant on any wrist, it's simple: no date or sweep second hand, but eye-catching."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wanted a good looking mesh band watch with a slim head to fit under dress shirts or just be wrist candy that you can forget about. Perfect match!! The blue is brilliant and the face is simple which lets the simplicity speak for itself. Price is great for a slim titanium face of good quality (as opposed to something like a Movado). The clasp is easily adjustable. THE ONLY DRAW is that the joints where the band meet the face are stiff - meaning they don't flex to fit your wrist like most watches. This is only a problem if you have skinny wrists but even then its only a minor flaw. Great watch. Happy I got to add Skagen to my collection."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "You won't find a better watch for the money. I don't think there IS a better watch. This is the most comfortable, reliable, long-wearing, easily adjustable watch I have ever owned. I have a $900 Movado that I never wear because the clasp always comes loose. Besides, I'm so happy with my Titanium Skagen I never want to wear anything else. The Skagen mesh bands are the most comfortable thing in the world against your skin.My only negative remark is don't buy the black. I had that one before and the black coloring wore off where the band meets the watchface, and it looked shabby. This watch I have now is all Titanium, nothing to rub off."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Pros:  It's gorgeous.  Silver face and silver mesh band goes with anything.  Looks much more expensive than it is.  Beautiful, sparkly round diamond-like chips for the numbers.  Lays flat against the wrist - not bulky and very comfortable.  Easily adjustable band.  Keeps good time.Cons:  No deal-breakers here, just things you might want to know ~ Not waterproof so you can't wear it in the shower. I have long hair and every once in a while it will catch in the mesh band. And no date display, if that's important to you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This watch is more beautiful than the picture gives credit.  It is sleek and simple.  I love the mesh band, it is lightweigh and elegant looking.  The crystals on the watch face help me tell time in the dark.  The band was a little hard for me to figure out, but once I read the manual (duh!!!)it was simple to adjust the band and clasp the band. It does not say waterproof on the watch itself, but the description says it is in the manual and I have accidently worn it in the shower without a problem.  I would purchase this watch again, absolutely."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased this watch about 3 weeks ago at a major chain membership store (for about forty bucks under retail).  I LOVE it.  The watch is very thin and does not get caught on sleeves or other clothing.  I have received about ten compliments on it in the short time I have owned it.  The face of the watch is a \"brushed stainless\" look and the band is both brushed and polished steel.  The dial markers are tiny tiny crystals (but do not look tacky in the slightest).  This is a very simple design for people who like the basics.  The watch has a very nice quality and I think will hold up for a long time.  The only thing I wish it had was a date indicator-but overall, this watch is a beautiful piece."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have purchased different brands and sizes of Knee Highs.  My legs are pretty wide at 200 pounds; but these knee highs are supposed to fit someone much bigger and heavy than I.  NOT TRUE.  I had to return them and have given up trying to find a pair of stockings/knee highs that I can wear without being tortured.  I am very short (5') so it's impossible to find regular stockings that won't choke my waist, and the same goes for the knee highs.  I have tried &#34;Q&#34; sizes to no avail, the elastic at the top is always terribly uncomfortable.  If you read this and have any ideas, please contact me? Thanks!"}

I wanted a slimmimg push up effect but not too much because I am already endowed.  This does it!Cons:There is a tiny bit of boob that drops under the underwire.  Not at all a big deal for me because it's not uncomfortable and it's unnoticeable when Iwear tighter fitting dresses."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just as beautiful as the photo, and provides great support! I did take the advice of other reviewers, and bought a size down (normally a 34C, and I bought a 32C). It fit great in that sense. However, I am a bit on the petite side (5' 2\") and the bottom of the torsolette kind of juts out--wouldn't look good under my wedding gown. I am returning it, but do recommend it if you have a slightly longer torso. I wish they made a petite size!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Love, love, love this cosmetic bag! I can't say enough positive things about this bag. It works perfect for my needs. I have always found it frustrating digging through bags trying to find the bottle I need. This solves that problem being able to where everything is at a glance. The smaller pockets at the top fit things like band-aids, chap stick, and nail clippers while the middle sized ones are the perfect size for travel sized sample bottles. The larger pockets at the bottom are perfect for several larger 12 oz bottles such as sunblock and hairspray. The bag then folds in half to lay flat fitting perfect in a carry on."}

When I went back to review the ad after having received men's, I actually couldn't find anything in the ad bold enough to say &#34;men's&#34; or &#34;women's&#34;, but what should have caught my attention was the shoe sizing. I purchased 8.5, but didn't realize it was expressed in men's sizing. Sometimes European shoe sizes are expressed weirdly, so I just attributed the sizing description to that, although I knew full well that Sperry's are American. Anyway, my bad.Sperry shoes are great! Just make sure you order shoes that suit your gender."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Beautiful mens shoe.  I ordered these for my husband as an everyday I love you gift and they went over very well!  He loves them and has pretty much worn them daily since.  They are a beautiful rich brown color that go great with everything.  He says they are comfortable and likes the style.  I like the three hole lace for him better that the other styles that only have two because he wears a size 11 it really helps break up the long look of the shoe.  Some of them just look silly in the front and make a mens foot look like a long bill.  These are much younger looking than the original style, but are still classy!  Great purchase and I know he will have them for a very long time."}

However, they replaced them immediately and the new pair seem to be fine.  I love the design!!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn Keen sandals in the past and the first pair I owned was for hiking and kayaking in the Western States.  They are very durable and comfortable in most every situation.  I purchased this pair to have a \"dress\" pair of sandals that could be worn to outdoor get togethers in the heat of the summer.  The lining for your foot is very comfortable and the leather and construction seem to be top notch.  You spend more for these on the front end but will have years of enjoyment in wearing them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I do a lot of field work across the world and have heard nothing but good things about these sandles - however for me, I can't even wear them. After 1 month, they just stank. Now, I don't have particularly smelly feet. And can't smell any other shoes, but these are bad. Others people with the same shoes tell me that as well (although they still like them). And I found them fairly uncomfortable. I remember that Teva's sandles, when they first came out, also smelled, and then they made them different. Oh, well."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These Smartwool trekking socks are great for everyday winter wear in the cold weather.  I wear them around the house and they keep my feet warm and if I need to throw on some boots and take my dog for a walk or run out, they keep my feet warm in the outdoor weather.  They are cushioned but not so much that you can't wear them with regular sneakers.  Smartwool socks are the best I have found for winter socks to keep my feet warm.  My only recommendation is to make sure you get the right sized socks because if they are too tight, even a little too tight, it will reduce circulation which creates cold feet.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a warm winter sock."}

{"label": 8, "raw": "I was delighted when it first arrived:  very silky, lightweight, long in the waist for tucking in, and a bit of a dip at the neck so it doesn't show above sweaters.  However, after washing it on delicate in lukewarm water and laying it out flat on a towel to dry, I was surprised to see how much it had shrunk in length...3 inches!  Luckily it still fits into my slacks, but not by much.  And the delicate pattern in the silk has condensed a bit, so it is not as silky as it was before.  Also, wearing it under a cashmere sweater does not protect me from feeling the slight itchiness of the wool on my skin.  Not sure if I would buy again, although I did feel warmer with it on, and the arm length is perfect.  I am a size 8 and I bought a small after having read the other reviews."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I almost returned these shoes, they're very light weight, almost too lightweight. It is only The hemp, no lining, no anything. The soles dont provide very good traction on wet/smooth surfaces. They 10 was a little big.BUTThey are very comfortable and look super cute with jeans. For running around on a nice day or walking around the city, they're pretty good.I don't hate them enough to return them, but don't love them enough to wear them all the time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I originally ordered a Large Tall. I'm 6'4&#34; with a 42&#34; chest, 34&#34; waist, 190 lbs, and wear a 16/36 in dress shirts. The Large Tall was perfect for length of sleeves and waist, but I could easily have gained another 100 lbs to fill it out.  I returned it and got the Medium Tall. It is MUCH better. Gives me enough room to wear a couple layers under and looks more like the guy in the picture with his hand in his pocket. The Large gave me enough room that I wouldn't be surprised if I could wear the Medium underneath it. This is a quality constructed jacket that should last for years."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This watch has everything I was looking for.  It is clear and concise, has day/date feature and Indaglo so I can see it in the dark.  I travel a lot and don't have to turn on the light at night.  I have a collector watch I am retiring and have a band I wanted to transfer to the new one.  Fine.  I read a complaint from someone regarding setting the day.  To do this you wind the watch backwards and the day will change correctly.  Otherwise, you will mess everything up."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I haven't seen an analog Timex Easy Reader priced this low for the past five years.  It's the perfect professor's watch because:1.  Only professors wear them (students have abandoned wrist watches in favor of cell phones, iPods and other digital devices).2.  Besides providing that dependable Timex time, it offers both the day of the week and the date (I'm just beginning to master the year and month without assistance).3.  If the watch is misplaced (the difference between a professor and an elephant), the cost of replacement is not prohibitively high.  (The same goes for repairs which, once you've factored in the drive to Walmart, are also not cost effective.)Thank you, Amazon.  Life is perfect."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This watch is Retro Cool - you grandpa might have worn this in the 1970's.Got it today at WalMart for $28.92.  I like the blue face and spartanly simple dial.Planned to immediately put it on a green canvas strap, but found I actually like the silver expansion band! I last wore an expansion band in 1970. The watch and expansion band have slim profile and won't trip you up walking through a doorway like a lot of the trendy 42+ mm watches. This watch has a pleasingly classic appearance.  Still might put it on the green canvas band later, though."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wasn't sure if I was going to like this as I was buying it online, but it is the perfect size and I love the big numbers and  ... my husband keeps trying to steal it! I have relatively small hands and a narrow wrist so was concerned about the size of the watch face because I know some of them are rather large (for a man's wrist) ... this one is perfect!TIP: I measured the top of my wrist to get an idea of what size watch face would work."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just recieved my new Timex watch. I have been an avid Timex product customer for many years so my reason to purchase a Timex was an easy one. This particular Timex is from their Easy Reader Collection. I am legally blind and needed a watch I could read without having to strain or use my magnifying glass with. This watch accomplishes this as well as looks very appealing as many more expensive brands. As far as purchasing from Amazon.com you just can not find a company more dedicated to quality and service. I always recieve my purchases ahead of projected dates and after more than 6 or 7 years of doing busines have never had to return anything from them. Great appreciation and high recommendations to Amazon.com."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, the strap is black but the dial itself is brown. It's very cute! great for simple outfits and it even has the date. The light up mechanism itself, is a button on the side that you pressed. I thought it would be the numbers itself so when I'm groggy in the middle of the night, I can just half-open my one eye, and I will be able to tell the time, but no, I have to push the button. Maybe I'm spoiled by technologies, but it's not hard to just make it glow, right? ah, what do i know."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The watch is very small. The face is about the size of a quarter, and the band is thinner than a half an inch. Some people say they can't see the date displayed on the watch, but I think those people might need to get their eyes checked. The date display is small, but plenty big enough to see if you have the right glasses prescription. Some people say the glowing wasn't bright enough, but I think it's great. I hate when it glows too bright to the point where it looks like you're trying to take down an aircraft with your watch. You can't see it glowing if you're in broad daylight."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this for my husband after his other velcro-banded watch stopped working. He loves it! The wrist opening is a little small and he has to &#34;squeeze&#34; his hand through the opening, but other than that he has all praises for this watch. He mentioned that sometimes he has to check to see if he is still wearing it because it is so light and comfortable. Also, the date stamp on the face and the Indiglo light make it a perfect day to night watch. Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The picture of the watch makes it look big with a very wide band. I was hesitant to order it because I thought it wouldn't look like a women's watch.When it arrived I was pleased to see that the band is less than an inch wide at the largest end. The watch is a beauty in that the numbers have bright (very small) silver arrows that point to the numbers. I like this feature because it only takes a quick glance to read the time. The face is fairly easy to read but really shines when Indiglow button is pushed the face then becomes a pretty shade of aqua and is a fairly bright light.While this a &#34;casual&#34; wear watch I like the fact that the matte black surround doesn't clash with rings and wrist jewelry.It light-weight and comfortable. I would buy this again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like the look of this watch very much, but 3 problems:  1) the band is relatively short, and 2) the straps to hold the band down (2) disintegrated after about 2 months, and 3) while the watch is waterproof, using it while swimming fewer than 6 times has resulted a faded and worn looking watch band. I'd buy it again if the band could be longer and there could be a more durable or perhaps a metal bracket to hold down the end of the band."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was ordering a wrist watch for my nephew and somehow, this product popped up.  As it looked similar to the watch that I was about to place in my shopping cart, I placed this one in the shopping cart, and did not pay attention to what I was buying.  When I received it, I contacted Amazon and received an immediate return authorization label.  I sent it back on Monday December 16, 2013 and have received my refund credit already on Tuesday December 17, 2013.  Great product.....just clicked on the wrong one."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Great Watch... I am on my 2nd one. My first watch is still working and keeping excellent time on my friends ATV handle bars. lol  I replaced the Band twice and bought a new one simply cause it started to not look so nice. It took the licking and kept on ticking for years with the original battery. Just too banged up to be presentable. So before the 3rd band wore out, and the battery failed... I decided to just buy a new one here. In a nutshell, Great watch... Easy to use... and a great price on Amazon.Mark from CANADA!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I found this watch for my husband probably 10 yrs. ago.  He is really hard on his watches being a mechanic.  He likes all the feature, backlight, timer, stop watch, alarm.  The band is the best, it has a strap that goes under the watch that helps to keep the pressure off the pins. It's Velcro so easy to remove when needing to quickly.  I only have to purchase new when he either scratches up the face to much or loses it like he did this time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "1. I am going to state the pros and cons of this according to my eight year old daughter.PROS2. The design is pretty.3. It glows in the dark.4. It makes telling, and learning how to tell time, time easy.5. It comes on and off pretty easy.6. It is lightweight.CONS1. The band is not water resistant and so the watch has to be removed too often. (It usually gets a little when she washes her hands.) Then there is a long period of waiting for the band to dry out when she can't use the watch. The alternative is to remove the watch whenever there is a chance that it will get wet some how and that can be time consuming and runs the risk of her losing it if she places it somewhere at school, in a public bathroom etc...2. The material of the wrist band itches her skin around her wrists if she wears it even slightly damp."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a really good looking ladies watch, plus it has my favorite feature of pushing the stem and having the watch face light up.  This is especially great during a boring movie, play, opera, etc., to tell you how much time you have left before you can get out.  Or going on a trip and waking up in the middle of the night and being able to see the time.  The gold finish with the pearlized face gives it a nice, expensive look.  The band is nice, but I'd like to see a grosgrain band for a dressier look.  All over, This watach gets an A+ from me, because of the price and the great look combined."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This gets use year round, not just in the winter.  In the winter, my wife and me both use it.  She gets to put on nice warm shoes and socks, and I get to put on nice dry shoes and socks.  I don't have a problem staying warm outside in the winter, even when temperatures reach -40.  My problem is sweat.  Shoes can only be washed so often, but it is nice to not have my shoes smell like they are rotting.  This does not get hot enough to cause any damage.  If you forget to turn it off and leave it on all day and night, you aren't going to burn your house down or triple your electric bill.  I might get another one for guests at the house."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Bought for my son for his work boots and gloves.  It dried his boots overnight.  There is no fan, so no noise, and he just put it in his bedroom using the floor mounts.  We had another boot drier with a fan that we used in the garage but this design is much better.  You would think this would do nothing because you can touch the prongs when it is on and it barely feels warm.  When I put my hand up inside when the boot was mounted on one of them though it was much warmer, but still not overly hot.  Pretty neat how it works."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have the double front cargo pants from carhartt and these are quite a bit longer, which is good for me, because I am 6'8&#34; and finding something that fits like these is not easy.  I just got these so I have not had a chance to verify the durability, but I can say that they are water resistant.  These are probably the best standard work pants for wet weather and resisting stains.  But I like how they are cut and the fit is ideal for wearing layers underneath but wearing them alone is fine as well. carhartt makes very practical work clothing and they tend to know what they are doing."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Carhartt for several years. I usually buy them at my local store but the Amazon price is $10 less and my local store would not match. The last 5 pairs of these pants I have purchased, including this pair have all been very bad on size consistency. I have worn the same size for years and up until recently there was little to no variation. But this last year or so has been pretty bad. I have seen variation's of at least an inch in inseam & waist. For me that is the difference of pants dragging on the ground or practically falling off my waist! I'm not sure what is going on in the quality control department, but I'm going to be trying the Duluth Fire hose pants now to see if they are more consistent. My co-worker swears by them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I looked for a long time for a 'starter' watch for my daughter.  I thought this was the best of what I could find.  First the pros:  the numbers are large, the second hand is a butterfly, and it lights up.  Cons:  the wrist band is adjustable which really means that it is never tight enough and slides around a lot.  I was hoping she would want to wear it every day, but she really doesn't like that it's not secure on her wrist."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "We have had many of these watches over the course of the last 13 years and 4 kidsI LOVE the following :-if they loose it, Timex will replace it-it is analog....kids need to learn this before going digital..it's vital!-it's sooo cute-the price...quality,  and it is able  get wet so the child does not have to take on and off constantlyMy only gripe on this watch is the band mechanism to secure the length of the strap. It seems to wiggle over time, or come loose. I wish it was able to hold it a bit &#34; tighter&#34; . We graduate our kids to a Timex Ironman digital once this has ran it's course."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Keen is one of the main brands of shoes that I wear this is my 4th pair these are great for beaches, hanging out or just casual walking but not for trailing.Pros: They are comfortable I don't have any problem at all with the fit and they are supportive at least for my feet. slipping them on and off is pretty easy for me so that's not a problem. Love that color combo! They protect my toes well as most Keens do. They have nice treads.Cons: THEY GET STINKY! I don't usually have problems with foot odor at all, but an attempt at bicycling, or long hikes in these and EWWWWW!  I find myself washing them frequently to avoid the odor."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'd give 3.5 stars if I could.  They look great and seem well made. they are super lightweight which makes them comfy but if you have sensitive feet like I do, there is one thing that you may not like. The inside footbed has a pattern on it and since the footbed is a molded raised material, this bothers me some.  I prefer a smooth surface but again, it is because I am sensitive and it makes the bottom of my foot sore just like if you had tiny debris under your foot would.  The super light weight though really is fabulous. I also like that it has good toe room so your big toe does not rub on top."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am so glad that i listened to the reviewers.  I am a true size 10 in all my shoes but ordered a half size larger for these and i am so glad i did that!  These fit perfect!!  I wore them last evening on a bicycle night ride and it was muddy and wet - i showered with these shoes on to clean them off and they are as good as new!!  I want to wear flip flops while biking but that's unsafe so i found these are even more comfortable because they give support , let air in for coolness and have toe protection too - plus they look really sporty!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have several pair of a no longer made Keen \"flip style\" which I love, but I love this shoe even better.  It has the same supportive sole, the toe protection and the secureness of the heel strap.  I love the flips for easy on, but for really walking around - this shoe is perfect for me.I have a normal to slightly high arch and a squarish foot.  I ordered my normal Keen size 9 and fit was perfect.  I threw caution to the wind and wore these 3 days in a row after receiving them - most of the days, tromping around doing errands.  I had 1 spot that was resolved by a nail trim and that was that.  I expected more irritation from the webbing but NOT!A bit more effort to put on than a slide or flip but not that much so they work for a quick out with my dog.I bought these on a \"special\" and wish I'd bought another or 2 more pair."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, so you're not going to be the belle of the ball by a long shot in these sandals...not even close...but that's not what they are intended for in the first place.  I just joined a rowing team and everyone on the team highly recommended purchasing a pair of Keens.  Our team color is purple, hence the color I selected (they are not as &#34;purple&#34; as pictured).  I took them out of the box, wore them around the house for a few hours, and was really surprised at how comfy they are.  In fact, I forgot I had them on. There isn't that &#34;newness&#34; or &#34;breaking in&#34; phase. They fit perfectly--and I did take the advice of others to order one half size up (a definite!).  I love them!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Bought these to go to Bali in February since a friend highly recommended them.  Decided to first wear these on a weekend vacation to Monterey and Carmel with lots of walking.  I put them on straight out of the box (with thin socks as it was a cool day) and walked miles in complete comfort.  I saw the other reviews that said go up a size but I ordered my regular size and they fit fine.  I usually wear a 7 or 71/2 and got the 71/2.  They are a bit wide in the toe box and I have very high arches but so far it's been OK.  Love the Sweet grape orchid color.  Cute and fun shoes.  They are going to Bali with me!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this sandal! This is my third pair. I wear them for rafting a few times per week all summer and am wearing a pair for house shoes right now. Heck, I even wear them for dress shoes! The fit is spot on. The heel height is a bit higher than many sandals, which I like, and I'm able to glue a lift in the right shoe for my short leg. They are very durable: The ones I've worn for over a year are have the leather straps (not designated H2O, but &#34;waterproof&#34;), like the pair being reviewed, and have held up exceptionally well against frequent exposure to water and sand. The soles are sticky enough for walking on rocks, and the heels of my older pair show very little wear, even though I walk on pavement with them quite a bit. The jester red/persimmon color is very pretty and matches many of my river, yoga and casual outfits."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I actually bought these from another site because of a 20% coupon code and free shipping,  although I did have to wait longer.....but anyways....Might I say this blue color is fabulous and uber cute! !!My feet are slightly wide. .. not wide enough for wide shoes,  but sometimes look puffy in mediums.  Mt size is a 9.I would say the 9.5 is perfect fit.  Not too snug,  even after walking 2 miles and my feet swell a bit,  they were not too snug and still felt good. Plenty of toe room too.The bottoms are a little more plasticy feeling,so to speak, than I expected but still comfortable.As a woman who has made the decision comfort is a priority but I still want a little cute,  I'm really happy with this purchase, perfect for the chic hippie,  lolBottom line. ..I world suggest 1/2 size larger and they are fine for a slightly wider foot.Happy Shopping :-)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Note - I usually wear a 9 and have to wear a 10 in these!Once you know the sizing, though - they're awesome. I wore them for 2 weeks straight and hiked all over Guatemala and Honduras and the Bay Islands. Not a single blister or back ache. They're amazing. You don't slip on wet surfaces, your feet stay in them, your toes are protected. The only drawback is that it's a little hard to get a stone or sand out, but that's a decent tradeoff for comfortable feet in my opinion. If you get them dirty you can hose or scrub them off and they look great - they can really take a beating.And they actually look cute on - I get tons of compliments whenever I wear them, which is often. They've become my go-to sandals now (what flip flops?). They're worth every penny."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I had my other pair of Keen's for 3 years and I wore them almost daily weather in Chicago permitting.  Well, one of my doc's took a look at them and told me I needed a new pair, the shoes were worn out on the bottom. That was last Wed evening. I ordered my new pair on Thursday and the shoes arrived on Friday. Amazon prime is the best deal ever!Okay, back to the shoes. I wear a 71/2 in shoes but read the reviews and ordered up to a 8. 8 fits perfectly.  I chose the color that was the cheapest, yes, some of the colors were $100 and well, I don't think a color is worth an extra $30 bucks.  My shoes were $67 bucks and I hope they last 3 years!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a shoe for travel, I read other reviews and decided it was what I needed for a visit to Easter Island.Sand, water, rocks, hiking, slick rocks and such, heat, comfort.  Wow these are just great for everything and my feet are happy at the end of the day.  Remember to put suntan lotion you the tops of your feet as mine are now look like a checker board from the sun.  I took them on to Thailand and even in the city they were great.  You can't go wrong with these sandals."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Got this and thought it could not be warm since it is thin.  Man, I had it on for a few minutes and was HOT.  Great Coat, warm and tough.UPDATE: After several days of backache I had to get rid of this coat.  It is very warm, but the sizes are a bit larger than the cotton version and due to the material, this coat does not bend or fold easily.  Basically every time I sat down, the top of the coat was pushing my shoulder up and hurting my neck.  The hood is nice when you're wearing it, but when you try to push it back, it hits the back of your head like a nail."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These jackets are great for work or leisure if you're into the outdoors. They run kind of big so I'd suggest getting a size smaller than you usually wear or getting the size you usually wear and then shrinking it with a warm (not hot) cycle in the washking machine or dryer. Some Carhartt jackets can be washed on hot, but depending on the material, a cycle on hot could ruin or damage material Carhartt uses in the production of some of their other jackets. I usually wear a large and I ordered this jacket in a large, and while it didn't fit like an XL, it was a bit too large. I washed it in warm water and dried in the machine and now it fits great. Loose, but tight enough to not look baggy or feel uncomfortably big. These jackets last, and they're great for light weight weather resistence or layering. I'd recommend this jacket to anyone as long as they keep in mind the sizing specifications."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "When i got this jacket i assumed that its for really cold weather because of the thermal lining.Its what i consider a 40 deg jacket maybe even lower if you layer something underneath.If you are looking for one that can handle colder temp i would suggest a quilted or parka lined Carhartt jacket.I have owned this for about 1 1/2 years now and it still look as it did when i bought it.I didnt give it 5 stars mainly because the zipper can be a PITA at times and the thermal lining is thin and not comfortable if you are wearing a short sleeve t-shirt."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Great jacket! Very warm! I've only warn it a few times but it fits great.  I got a Tall size because I'm 6'5\" and I don't think I've ever had a jacket fit so well.  Looking forward to having this for the bitter Chicago winter.  It's stiff at first, but that's what you'll get with tough gear like this.  If you want something soft and fancy looking, go somewhere else (i.e. northface, columbia). This is definitely a tough jacket for tough guys!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband's favorite winter jacket finally wore out.  He was heartbroken.  Naturally, I went to Amazon to find him a new one.  Looked at many, many jackets and read reviews.  Finding this Carhartt Jacket, reading the reviews, I ordered it.  I told him about it and he just knew he wasn't going to like it, it wasn't going to fit - blah blah blah.  Well, it arrived just in time for the severe below zero weather.  This jacket is everything it claims to be - keeps him warm in below freezing weather, looks sharp, has the inside pockets which are a must for my husband.  He's 6'1 and 250 lbs. and most things I buy for him are XXL.  Went with XL on this jacket because it's a Tall and it fit him perfectly!  Highly recommend."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "If you are going to be working outside in ridiculously low temperatures, then this is for you. It defines warmth and is probably going to outlast the wearer, the quality is that good.  But beware. 1) it fits big.  I wear a XXX-Tall in EVERYTHING, but in this product, that is way too big.  2) It is for seriously cold weather.  I will not suit you for anything else. That is not a negative, but you need to know that and buy something else unless you are really going to be out for long periods in VERY cold weather.  3) It is very big and stiff and bulky.  It really IS 'outerwear'. I returned mine because it was not fit for my purpose.  But I did so with a heavy heart because it was just so well made and full of features..."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Im usually a xl or xxl. With this jacket Im a large, I think I could of maybe got a medium even. This jacket is very warm and makes a good winter work jacket for me here in connecticut. This is NOT a light spring or fall jacket. 45 degrees and up you sweat. Its very tough and the arms are long enough. The hood is insulated so its very warm. You do not need any kind of winter hat when wearing this jacket with the hood up. My only problem is the zipper is hard to zip for the first couple of inches but its very slowly getting better with time. Im not sure if all the zippers are like this or just mine."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "this is the jacket ive been looking for!! very tuff outer shell.. the flannel inside the jacket is very soft and warm. this is now my favorite jacket. the large tall is fits me well.. iam 6'4 so the extra 2in in length over the standard large helps. Carhartts run large so this is a very big jacket for a large size but i already knew that and i don't mind. perfect work jacket and its made in america!!! which is why i chose it over other models of work jacket and iam very glade i did.. bottom line buy this jacket you wont regret it.. just remember that they run big so if you normally wear an xl or xxl jacket a large carhartt will pry be your best bet."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just the usual superb Carhartt quality.  This coat is warm, tough, comfortable, and surprisingly good looking.  I wear it on hunting trips AND to go out to nice places in my city.  It looks as good today, many outdoor hiking and hunting trips layer, as the day I bought it a year ago.  Brass hardware both looks good and is really durable.Oh, and as some reviewers are saying, it starts out really stiff.  Trust me, a year later it feels like the most comfortable coat you've ever owned.  Like good boots, you need to break this in.  It's tough as nails, it has to start out stiff.I basically will only buy Carhartt outerwear these days for any serious function.  No one but Dickey comes close on quality.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband looks so cute in these. I bought them for him for work. He's constantly ripping holes in his front pockets from pulling tools and pens in and out, but so far, hasn't had any problems with these. The flat-front is very attractive. As some other reviewers mentioned, the waist fits snugly. I took a chance and purchased my husband's usual size, and he actually likes the way they fit. It took him a few wears to break these pants in, but he's very happy with them. I expect that they'll outlast the brands he usually purchases."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Not the best pants in the world but these are Dickies. If you want a pair of &#34;office casual&#34; pants that will last you and are cheap these are it. Wash them a few times before wearing to lessen the &#34;swish&#34; sound they make as you walk and loosen them up a bit.Like the header says, standard. These pants are pants. You get 2 front pockets and 2 back packets that will fit keys, a wallet, a lighter. Hook snap at waist and zipper fly.  Color. I never iron them. Standard wash and dry. If I leave them in the drier too long they come out wrinkled and I just hang them for a day and they come out fine.I bought these to replace 2 other pairs I have in rotation that I have worn at the office for 3 years now.Belt loops are a tad tight for thicker leather belt."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Be sure to go up in size. Anyone who wears Dickies apparently knows this. I looked at my man's pants to order him new ones, and there was no size that I could find on the old ones. So I ordered his normal pants size. Way too small. So I sent it  back and went up 2 sizes, and that was too big. Should have ordered one size up. Know your Dickies size and write it down!The fabric is stiff and sturdy, almost indestructible, does not lose its color in the wash."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My son wanted a Dickies work pants for work, something comfortable, of good quality and could handle the wear and tear required of his daily tasks.  He wanted a bright color to match with the theme required at work, so Royal Blue would be the closest and acceptable to the theme.  When I purchased this Dickies Men's Original work pants for him I did not know what to expect, since I was ordering a different style from a previous choice in my order.  The package arrived quickly, quality excellent, and the pants is comfortable, allows you to move freely in the pants and are true to size. The Seller has provided accurate advertising in the description of these pants.  The packaging was excellent.  I would recommend this style of Dickies Men's Original 874 work pants to anyone seeking pants that can withstand durability, has quality, is reasonably priced, and you have choices of various colors to choose from, and are true to size and advertisement of the product."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've own several 874's and they've all lasted me years. When I was younger I worked a bunch of construction jobs, and these were my go to pants. Now I build and manage servers and work in an office where it's business casual. These are still my go to pants. They're extremely high quality, but they tend to take forever to become worn in. The waist band can really stiff, and take a couple months to loosen up. These will always be my go to pants for work and I suggest them for anyone looking for a pair of high quality pants."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Great pants. Perfect fit.Wrinkle freeStain resistant. What more could you want?I don't know how other people are getting too big or small pants. I have ordered Silver, Khaki, and Black. They are a perfect fit. I always order a size bigger just in case they shrink after washing. I will update if any changes after washing. I would give this a 5 star but I don't like the clasp closure, I'd rather have a button. But Dickies does not have 34x29L pants with a button closure.Thank you amazon."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This sweater is much thinner then I expected. The photo shown to advertise it looks like the sweater is pretty thick or at least medium. When I got it, it was very thin & even looked stretched, the front design was very open. In the picture it looks like the design is stitched tight and therefore well made but the one delivered to me wasn't. Also, the arms are way too long. I ordered size Medium knowing the length of the sweater is kind of long, that's ok but when the sleeves are way too long, then it's not practical. No wonder the women in the picture has one arm held up and the other in her pants pocket.I have ordered before from National & it was all good, but not this time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am also a buyer who bought this for my mother, who is in her eighties. It is absolutly perfect, and quite attractive, for the older set, being of a more conservative design. It may possibly work for a younger person, if you know how to jazz it up.The weight is perfect for indoor use, and thin enough to layer under a jacket for outdoor use, if needed. It seems to be made quite well. There is a plethora of colors to choose from. I bought the Navy, to play it safe, but may buy my Mom more of these sweaters in varying shades to spice up her wardrobe. This sweater has nice, clean lines, yet feminine with the subtle stiching details. Not cheap looking at all, attractive in appearance. Also it will be easy to launder and dry.I liked that this company included a catalog of their goods in the package, as there are quite a few wardrobe items that my Mom would really like, without breaking the bank."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "All right, let's get right down to it! When it comes down to intimate apparel, there is nothing that captures a man's eyes and imagination as thigh-high stockings!These soft and sexy stockings wear well, and stay up. So, you don't need to use a garter, but I do recommend one. (I don't believe in understatement in the bedroom.)I highly recommend these stockings to you - or for you men, buy them as a gift!(Review of Sheer Lace Top Back Seam Thigh Hi Stockings)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was asked to get some fishnets.  Im a lil above average...5'8, 190 pounds with NOT toned legs lol.  Anyhow, I figured plus size would work.  They did.  They tops do not roll down, or squeeze the fat up over them.  I wore them with garters and a garter belt.  The only thing I don't like is that they are the loose knit, not stretchy kind...so I can see them losing shape if you don't tend to them by handwashing periodically."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a &#34;sleep leisure&#34; bra, so I wasn't expecting a push-up, but it might be a little too comfortable and relaxed with the fit if you've got a large chest. Also, I absolutely know my bra size and ordered this in my correct size and it was WAY small. I returned and ordered the next size up and it was actually still a bit snug, but workable. I'd take that into consideration when buying and, if you are busty like me, you might want to go a different direction."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am a relatively small woman with naturally large breasts.  As such I have never been able to wear a bra without an underwire.  However, when I got pregnant and found my once comfortable C cups very full Ds, it became painful to sleep without a bra.  I purchased this bra with the hopes to find relief while I slept from both the breast tenderness and the soreness associated with the underwire bras I was used to.  It was heaven sent!  I couldn't believe something as soft and gentle as a t-shirt could provide just the right amount of support to keep me contained but comfortable.  I had to come back and order more!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I received this bra today, and was eager to at least try it on.  It is comfortable, BUT, it seems like it's a little smaller than what I am used for for a 44.  It feels like it's a 40 or 42.  It seems like it will roll up, either on the sides or back.  I've had bras that do that and this one feels like it will do it, but it hasn't done it so far, so maybe it's just me.  Be careful if you have rings on and you are putting this on.  I nicked it a little and pulled out some of the thread with my ring.  I don't see how because there's nothing sharp or sticking out on my ring.  I just took a lighter and burnt the thread down.  Overall, it is a fairly decent bra, it is comfy and pretty stretchy, just don't get anything around it that may get a hold of the threads in it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been looking for something comfortable to wear around the house and I've found it. I just had a baby a few months ago and I'm huge (42C). This fits perfectly. It's not too tight and not too lose and it provides some support. Not as much as my underwire, but around the house, it's great. I forget I have it on and the hooks in the front don't bother at all.It also keeps you separated... no uni-boob, which is awesome.All in all a good investment."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wanted something that I could wear around the house on those &#34;just want to be comfy&#34; days.  This bra fits the bill.  I wear a 36DD and went with the 38D/D/DD size.  The cups fit good and do not cause a uniboob like a lot of bras like this cause.  However, the band was a bit snug on me.  When I reordered a couple more I went with the 40C/D/DD and like that fit much better.  I would say this is the next most comfortable thing to bra-less :-)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Got it for those &#34;hang around the house in a sweatshirt&#34; days.  For the most part it's quite comfortable.  The band is a little snug-feeling by the end of the day - but that's why I opted for a front closure (and can reasonably unhook the bottom 1 or 2 hooks).Hopefully some ladies agree with me:  the bra I put on in the morning (comfy) is not the one I take off at night (band is too snug).  This bra is as close as it comes to being the best answer to that problem.  I look the array of colors it came in too."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered the 38 F/G/H even though I wear a J in most bras, and this actually fit me very well; I'm surprised at the other reviews that say it fits small. They're fairly supportive for a leisure bra. I wear these all the time, even out shopping.Edit: I wrote the above based on the black ones I ordered. I made another order of the black with tan dots, and they were much smaller, particularly vertically. I can still wear them, but they're not as comfortable, and for the most part I just wear them over other bras.Edit: ordered more plain black ones, and they fit as before. Strange that the fit would vary by color."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My surgeon recommended that I wear sports bras 24/7 after surgery. I tried a number of bras pre-surgery, but this one and one by AMOENA were by far the best fitting and most comfortable. I'm wearing them 2 at a time for better support, and have been comfortable enough to order two more to keep me going while the others are in the laundry. The fit is a bit on the large size, mostly because the bra is stretchy. However, that stretchiness came in really handy for keeping ice packs in place the first few days. The front hooks have made getting into and out of this bra easy enough for me to manage without help. All in all, I've been very happy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Absolutely gorgeous! A perfect replacement for those nylon and spandex, unlined bras Calvin Klein used to make, that made the breasts look completely natural and not \"packaged\" like they do with \"contour cups.\" Unfortunately, the band and cups do run small. A 38DD fit like a 36C. In fact, this is the second Wacoal Bra I've tried that ran small (see my review ofWacoal Women's Halo Lace Full Coverage Underwire Bra # 65547). I'd buy three if the size went up to 40D!! But alas, 99.9% of racerback and racerback-like (close-set straps) bras stop at 38D or DD. If you're a smaller chested woman, this bra is THE CURE to all those ridiculous euphemisms for padded bras: \"molded cups,\" \"T-shirt bra,\" age-defying lift\" and my favorite, \"seamless.\" Thank you very much, but simple nylon over my own breast is actually seamless!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The first thing you notice about this bra in Toast color is that it looks as a posture correcting device in terms of color, fabric texture, overall design and ugly straps in the back, in particular. So, in short, the look is bad, you cannot undress without scaring your man. Perhaps, in black this bra would look better, but far from being attractive anyway. The cups are very thin, as other reviewers already noticed, but for me it was not a problem. Hence, I give it 2 stars for holding the straps at the center as a T-back supposed. The bust support is OK for one day until fabric stretches. Wonder why it is so expensive if it is neither good sport or comfort bra, nor a sexy dress style."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear Wacoal all the time and the band size on this definitely runs small (I'd say by one size; I'm normally 34D, but could have used a 36 in this; I think the sizing issue is because the band isn't adjustable and they decided to err on the side of too snug). The lift is nice, and the straps sit in the middle of the shoulder as pictured instead of riding to the center like so many t-backs. The fabric is quite thin so don't expect any, er, cold-weather protection. I do recommend it, just know what you're getting."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been buying this bra for many years,  however it was about 4  years ago when I bought the last one.  This new one just doesn't seem like the same quality that it used to be.  I ordered two Wacoal bras,  they are both made in two different places.  This one is made in Dominican Republic,  the other one in China.  The one from China seems like the old  Wacoal quality and worth the money.  This one does not,  and it certainly in my opinion isn't worth what it cost.  The cup fabric looks as if it would wear out quickly to me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this one bra on a trial basis. I was worried since many people said it was so thin you would need to have a cover for nipple area. Well, yes if you are wearing a thin shirt this might be an issue. But the fit and comfort FAR outweigh that issue for me. I bought one in white and black I love them so much. Worth every penny and then some. The fit is perfect, the support is great, the fact my shoulders are not being dug into as this doesn't sit there---I love that. I wear a 36C so not like I'm huge and need alot of support. Just enough to help keep the girls in their place. This bra does exactly that."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The more I wear it, the more I love it.  It's so comfortable.  I'm not constantly messing with the straps and tugging on it because I'm about to fall out of it.  This bra fits really well.  The minute I put it on, I can stop thinking about it for the rest of the day.  The straps stay put and don't dig in to my shoulders.  Plus, I love not having to worry about the straps showing.  Fits true to size and fits well.  Good support.  Have all three colors now.  :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Although I love the look of the bra, and the size seems fine, I was hoping for something more comfortable. Unfortunately, it seems that when I purchase good looking, somewhat supportive bras, I find them uncomfortable, and after just a short period of time, can't wait to take them off. The comfortable ones may lack style and support but they do offer comfort. If only someone could design the perfect match. Also, this one does show back fat and I was hoping for a sleeker look. I'm a 38D so, unfortunately, in professional settings, I do need to wear a bra with a bit of support. Just haven't found the perfect one yet."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So many guys wear panty's and not even their wives know. My wife started me in panty's years ago and this is all I wear. These are by far the most comfortable panty's you can buy and I have a lot of different ones myself. I have no problem changing In dressing rooms at the pool or gym wearing these panty's. I don't hide that I wear panty's. I have even changed in locker rooms wearing lace and even ruffles. Guys if your sick of cotton like I was these are the ones to try. Everything about this panty is great and before long you will be in panty's forever."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was very excited to order these panties. Tried them on and was instantatly amazed. A sexy, string bikini is very hard to find,especially one as comfortable as this tactel string bikini. Not only are they nice looking, but this material is very heavenly. Love the feel on my skin. i have a 36 waist usually take a 6 in most panties and these were very nice. My my most recent purchases however, have been size 5 and with the stretch of this of this panty i'll only buy a 5 in the future. Now have every color. These are simply awesome to wear! i wear panties 24/7 now and love it. These are my favorites withou a doubt. men, do your selves a favor and check them out."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Love love love these underwear for years now.  I've rarely had a problem with underwear riding up my bum with these, which is the main reason I buy these.  I'm a full figured woman, but also wore these when I was more athletic and they're wonderful.  Wearing them to work as a professional to the gym, they fit great.  They last for years too which is amazing.  I finally replaced some after going through a pregnancy and stretching some out.  My main helpful hint is to wash them in a bag or by themselves to avoid balling up from other clothes."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm giving these 2 stars because they are comfortable and basically the best pair of \"drawers\" lol I've ever purchased.HOWEVER they lied! You can clearly see your panty line so don't wear any  form fitting clothes with these!!I wore a high low maxi dress with Jockey Skimmies Slipshorts underneath so that's two articles of clothing on top and as clear as day I was able to see my panty outline!Another time I wore a pair of  light color jeggings and not only did the panty line show but the middle seam and the design on them did too!!very embarrassing!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "A lot of workout bottoms nowadays tend to ride up or roll down, if you know what I mean.  It's increasingly difficult to find anything that stays put as needed when running, walking, stretching, whatever.I've long been a fan of Champion for their low prices and high quality products.  That's why I turned to them for my most recent gym-bottom purchase.These shorts are prefect.They rest comfortably on my upper waist and stay in place by way of an inch-plus wide elastic band that is comfort encased by a soft material (it's a new elastic product as I've found that same band on sports bras of a different brand).  The 9\" inseam is long enough to keep the short just above my knees without creeping up.They keep me cool and dry off quickly for those who may not have the luxury of doing laundry every day.Overall, highest marks."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have tried every bra out there from cheap to very expensive.. If you need support and a decent looking bra, this is the bra for you. I am a 50 year old large busted woman who needs support in a bra. I have been professionally fitted and spent $100's of dollars on bras and always kick myself and go back to Bali..After almost 40 years I will not bother with any other bra again. Now I just order a new set of all colors about every 6 months....it can't be beat.."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this bra over two years ago on a whim from a different website, and I almost wore it out to the point where the hooks on the back started coming apart. Its lacy so I wasn't expecting much comfort, but I literally wore it day and night PLUS my girls arent as &#34;perky&#34; as they were after my first baby so they give excellent support, are true to size, and comfortable enough. They also dont show through any cute shirt you might want to wear."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Bought this on a whim, and I absolutely love it!  For larger sizes, it's not super supportive, but still gets the job done.  Really attractive but somehow still kind of modest.  No lines or pointy boobs!Pros:- Sizing seems accurate (I wear 40D in Victorias Secret, same here)- full coverage without lines or pointy boobs- kind of sexy but kind of modest at the same time- washes well - no color run- thinner, but the lace is thick enough to prevent any major nip issues (still wouldn't wear with super thin tops though)Cons- very light support for the larger sizes ( I'd widen the strap!)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "As suggested by other people, this bra DOES run small in the number and a bit more spacious in the cup size than the average bra. If you like your bras on one of the inner hooks, measure your ribs where your bra sits and add 4 to the number - if you only add 2 you will be wearing it on the outermost set of hooks.I'm a 40H - I ordered a 42G and it fits very well - though I prefer to have at least 1 extra set of hooks that are looser than what I use just in case.Would I order it again? Yes.Would I probably pick a 44G instead of a 42G having tried this bra? Unless I lose some weight in the near future, yes."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was sorta skeptical when I got this bra. But it proved to be the best bra I ever wore! Love the light blue color that I got and its really smooth to the touch on the cups. Liked that the adjustable straps were in front. Also love the little bow in the middle. Will definitely buy the pink and white ones. Thank goodness I don't have to wear under wire to get the support I need. I didn't even notice I had it on! And thankfully no red marks on my shoulders or itchiness anywhere.Hope they never discontinue this bra!!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Wow, I'm pretty shocked as to how many positive reviews this bra has.  The cup is shaped very weird, When on, it makes my boobs look like torpedoes!  And it pushes them wayyy to far apart.  They stick out too much on the sides and just makes the shape of my chest look un-natural.  No bueno.  I see other reviewers have had the same experience as me with this bra.  I sent it back immediately!The Bali #3372 is the one that makes my boobs look great and feel great, even though it's itchy sometimes.  This one looked almost the same, so I gave it a try.  But the way it looks on is very different from the way it looks off."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The bra is well made and probably would last a long time, but the sizing on it seems off from other Bali bras.  I have been wearing Bali bras for quite a few years and love them, but they have discontinued the one that I have been wearing and I have been looking for something similar, thought this might be it, but it's not. This bra would probably work better for a larger breasted woman, has wider straps both for shoulder and the back and the cups seems cut for larger breasts.  Had to send this one back, will keep looking."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been wearing this style for several years now and it is truly the most comfortable and best fitting bra I've ever had. Of course everyone has a different shape so you'll have to try it for yourself to see if it suits. Washes easily in the washing machine on gentle (and inside a lingerie bag), dries quickly, and off you go again. Several of my girlfriends have also started wearing this bra since they saw mine at my swimming club, and they love it too. I don't understand the person who said it didn't have an underwire - they must have shipped her the wrong thing - as it does indeed have underwiring. Also, only 2 hooks high at the back, not the corset-like 3 hooks (like so many of the bras made for larger gals have). Just great, and highly recommended."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Wacoal doesn't make the style I've been wearing anymore but this new style is a good substitute. It fits well, is true to size and quite comfortable...for a bra, that is. I like this style as well as the old style. Kinda nice to have a change. This is a good everyday bra...should last a long time. Wacoal makes good quality, good fitting bras that wear well. A bit pricey but worth it. I got the white but would like to get the other colors when they become available."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am 5'5\" and about 160 lbs. I got the size Queen 1 because of the reviews saying to get a size up since they cut into your thigh. I am wearing these with a garter belt under a dress so I needed them to fit comfortably. I got nude, and I am very pale and the color works. They aren't too shiny either. This size is supposed to fit up to 225 lbs and 5'6\" and they fit pretty well on my thigh but the lace band sits pretty low. It starts just a few inches above my knee, so keep that in mind. You will need adjustable garter straps and a knee length dress. I can't wait to try these on with my garter and dress!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The first thing I noticed was the frayed edges on the lace that were unraveling right out of the package.  The hose are indeed quite thin and while I managed not to put a run in them, I can't imagine they would last anywhere near a good pair of L'Eggs.  They were a bit hard to get on (imagine putting on your garters with your hose together, good luck getting it straight the first time...!) but, you get used to it.  What I would never get used to is that once I sat down to dinner and then stood back up, the garter was now riding halfway down my butt!  The host themselves were now down near my knees, with the lace tops well below where a mid-thigh skirt would hit.  Nope, these are going in the trash."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "my non control top pantyhose with sheer toe nylons are very sheer and pretty pantyhose, im an older woman who wears pantyhose and nylons everyday, non control top pantyhose are the same as sheer to waist pantyhose, so if i want a sheer pantyhose look on my legs my non control top pantyhose are wonderful. i wear these pantyhose in the sheer toes as well. i think i have these nylon pantyhose in the reinforced toe pantyhose too. i usually wear no nonsense pantyhose and nylons but i like hanes pantyhose also, i own several pairs of these pantyhose, they seem to last as long as my other pantyhose."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "ive been wearing hanes pantyhose only recently, i prefer no nonsense pantyhose for my daily wear. but i am really liking my hanes pantyhose and nylons, theyre very sheer pantyhose for a sexy look but very durable pantyhose that hold up to my daily pantyhose wear, i wear high heels and pantyhose to work everyday and high heels can wear my pantyhose down, so i prefer reinforced toes pantyhose and hanes pantyhose has lots of reinforced toe pantyhose to choose from, i like sheer toe pantyhose but they run more. i find it hard, very hard, in the morning to pick my favorite pantyhose to pull up, i have so many different kinds of pantyhose and nylons, but hanes sheer pantyhose are one of my new favorites"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have very swollen lower legs and feet when I sit a lot, fly, or stand a lot.  I have a lot of compression knee hi socks and a pair of thigh highs. They worked pretty well in reducing the swelling, but never all the way, plus the elastic would dig into my leg at the base of my knee and leave a big groove.  My toes got pulled tight too.  Then, I found these socks.This brand and style and compression level are perfect in every way.  They don't dig into your leg at the top, they don't pull on your toes, they are very comfortable, look sporty, and they keep all of the swelling in my legs away.  I have 3 pairs now but I plan to get a few more.  So glad I stumbled upon this brand and style."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been buying Wigwam socks for hiking and other outdoor adventures since I was in college. I order 2 pairs of these Hiking Pro socks for a motorcycle road trip because I knew they would keep my feet comfortable for long days on the saddle. I rode 3,500 over 4 days. Two days there, two days back with a week of adventure in between. My feet stayed warm and dry and they were a great complement to my Salomon Quest 4D GTX boots.If you haven't tried Wigwam socks, they have always seemed true to fit for me. They are soft, offer good support, great air flow & insulation. I definitely recommend trying these - the price may seem a little high for socks, but they are fair for &#34;performance&#34; socks and they hold up great."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I used these for hiking and I didn't want anything too heavy or bulky so these were just what I wanted.  I wear a lighter pair of wicking socks under these.  They fit nicely, had plenty of stretch and were nice and soft.  They dried quickly when I removed my hiking boots.  I am very please with this purchase.  I keep an extra pair in my pack if needed.  I hiked 10 miles up and down Mt. Katahdin with no blisters or anything so I have to say these socks did the trick to the max.Tom"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been trying to find a pair of trail running socks, but most everything I've seen or tested is at both ends of the spectrum - either too thick and tall, or too thin and short. Although they are called Hiking/Outdoor Socks, I would not consider them trail running. They are very comfortable due to thickness, but that's not what I want in a trail sock. Still, I can't fault them for hiking because they are quality made and feel good in hiking shoes/boots."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am a woman who loves wearing men's levi's in this fit (or 555, 501, 565).  I had gastric bypass and just like how they hang and the weight/thickness of the jean material.  Most women's jeans are thinner, shallow pockets and have spandex, which I don't need.  I like the tighter fit, seems to keep everything tight.  And without the spandex, the jeans are warmer for the colder climes.  I've always been a levi's fan!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've always worn Levi's jeans. Recently, however, they don't seem to last like they used to. Jeans that I have bought within the last 5 years or so, seem to wear out faster than older pairs I've had. Particularly around the pockets and the seam in the crotch. The material seems thinner too. While this makes them a tiny bit more comfortable, they don't make 'em like they used to. Still kinda expensive too, but they go on sale every once in a while. Or I can use points to buy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The pants seem to be acceptably made (the label indicates it was made in Cambodia) - although slightly thinner material than I expected.  The color that I ordered (Blue Collar) is fine and is what I expected.  However, these pants are way too tight on the thighs - especially when sitting down, and it makes the length appear much shorter because of it.  I though about keeping them, but I cannot put up with the tightness at the thighs.  Also, the pockets seem to \"bunch up\" too much and you must often put your hands in your pockets to keep them down...a major fail, so I'm returning them and will try out the Levi's Men's 560 Comfort Fit Jean instead."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So annoying. I've been wearing Levi's 505 as long as I can recall. The move to overseas production has really hosed up the quality of these jeans, though. And they are terribly, terribly inconsistent. In the most recent instance, I ordered two pairs from the same seller through Amazon, in different colors. What I've noticed over the last few years is that different colors appear to be made by different foreign factories -- some in Mexico, some in China, some in Bangladesh, etc. And depending on where they are made, the weight of the fabric and the actual fit is quite inconsistent. When I order these things, I want/expect them to fit the same way, every color, every time. Not an unreasonable expectation, I think. Levi Strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years. Evidently, though, like most other American businesses they have simply ceased to give a rip, opting for comparatively inexpensive labor and compromised quality. Makes me frickin' sad."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased Levi's 505 regular fit for my Husband, and he is hard to find the right length, the size is no problem. he had lost 51-lbs of weight from being ill, now he is eating better. so, i got 34x29. my husband tried them on and they fit to a T, even after i washed them. Levi's is the only denim this family can wear, they are the perfect fit. I highly recommend Levi's brand denim, they have been around since the 1853."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I grew up wearing Levi jeans, and these new Levis are not what they used to be, that's for sure. Levis cut their jeans in a way that fit me better than most other jeans I've tried, but the denim Levi is using these days just does not measure-up to their competitors denim what so ever. I got these 505 jeans in the rigid un-washed denim, so it's the heaviest denim Levi uses, but they still feel like weak pants with all the fabric-body of a worn-out bed sheet. I used to love my Levis, but now I hate where I see the quality of their products are heading."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Pretty nice jeans. They are very dark and the color does run when they are washed. They definably fit larger than the 505's in &#34;Range&#34; that I bought in the same size. These sit at the waste not below. I soaked them when I first got them and have washed and dried them a few times and they shrank some but are still bigger than the 505's in &#34;Range&#34;.Bottom line is these are Levi's and they are notoriously inconsistent. You can find them almost anywhere. I would just buy in store so you know they will fit ok."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was looking for decent Levi's for a few years and Amazon had them!!!  I wanted the stiff unwashed jeans because they last quite a few years.  The pre-washed jeans are VERY comfortable and ready to wear, but I hope they have the same life as the unwashed (stiff) Levis.  The size was the  same as my original 505's and fit me well.  They were a bit expensive at $40 vs ($10 - $15) for Wranglers, but they feel great and wear well.  The Levi's in the store are sold with holes in them!!!! I'm 50 + years old and I don't need the holes thanks anyway!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These jeans are awesome.  I see that there are a lot of negative reviews about how Levi's changed the fit of these jeans (however long ago...), but I wasn't wearing them back then so I cannot speak to that issue.  But from what I can tell there shouldn't be any complaints about fit!  These jeans look great and fit well.  They are also high quality.  What else could you want?  Them to come with money in the pockets?  Well me too but that goes for everything I buy.  Get a pair, you won't regret it!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these Levis because I haved owned many pairs in the past and they have always been good quality jeans I could trust. Levis was recently bought and since has tried to change their look to appeal to the younger crowd. They messed with just about every type of jeans except the 501 but that has button fly and I prefer a zipper fly. The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I can't stand it. My old 505s did not do this. The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them. They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle. These are horrible jeans in terms of fit and quality, look elsewhere until this company learns it lesson not to mess with a good thing."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I don't like that the different styles are made in different locations so you never really get a consistent make or wear with Levi's anymore.  This particular &#34;lot or batch&#34;  was good.  However, they seem to be thinner than usual.  Not really sure if that a new thing.  They have 7 belt loops.  Some poor reviews stated they had 5.  This again may be a consequence of multiple manufacturing facilities.Overall, basic Levi quality with expected characteristics.  Price is more reasonable online than most store retailers.  I think this offsets risks."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been wearing Levi 501s for over 25 years. By mistake I ordered these 505s instead of 501s. It took a little getting used to having a zipper instead of button fly. Actually I think the zipper may help increase the life of my jeans. Over time the buttons have tended to wear the buttonholes on my 501s making them a little loose.These 505s fit just as well as my 501s have fit over many years. I'll almost certainly continue to buy Levis for the next 25 years. The only question will be: 501 or 505?"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've always wanted to buy several Levi's and be brand loyal but over the years the sizing across several styles and denim is simply all over the place. Seat is usually way too tight or too baggy (as is the fit),  inseam is always way too long. Had hopes with this style but again, disappointed. Certainly not a brand for those looking to avoid way too skinny or way too baggy jeans. Simple straight legged pants that fit as sized on the labeling are extremely hard to come by these days. Levi's sizing is so erratic you basically need to try on a dozen pairs across a dozen styles to get remotely close to what might adequately fit. Shouldn't be this hard to buy Levi's."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have to agree with some of the other reviewer comments regarding the decline in quality for Levi jeans.  The material seems a lot thinner than the last pair of jeans I purchased.  Besides the flimsy material the jeans didn't fit well either.  I have worn the same size jeans for the past several years.  I would swear the pair I just purchased on Amazon was at least a size too big. I ended up buying the size pair of Lee jeans on Amazon and they fit just right and the quality of material was a lot better.  Lee jeans has a new customer."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got a 38 by 29 for my husband in &#34;Fume&#34; color and oh boy does he look HOT! I'm in love with this color, plus the fit was awesome and way beyond my expectations.Hubby doesnt have a body like a model, he's got a bit of belly (at 5'9&#34; and 215 pounds), so I was apprehensive about how this straight fit was gonna work out..because it's actually more like a slim fit, but it looks great.I was tired of him wearing &#34;relaxed fit&#34;...too baggy for my taste..too much like &#34;pop jeans&#34;...no offense for guys who like the style.I wanted something...how can I put it?!....something younger, fit and svelte, to make his legs look longer...and I'm very pleased with these 505.I will definitely buy him more, in other colors."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered these when my local store didn't have the right size & color combination. The jeans arrived promptly, packaged in a plastic bag (inside a soft plastic shipping bag). The fit was exactly the same as my other 505s and identical in every other way, too. (If you're new to 505s, they fit something like 1&#34; larger than stated, e.g., 30&#34; stated size fits an actual waist size of about 31&#34;)Inspect the photos carefully, since there are lot of color options. I've had both the light and dark stonewash colors, which are even in their shading (none of the fake &#34;worn&#34; areas). Enjoy!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "It's nice to see that Levi's add a touch up style to their Legendary Americas favorite blue jean. I was surprised to see these jeans from Levi's, so I purchased these, since I now own several other brands of these some what leather look like jeans to update my style. I like the fact that these are still Levi's, same fit, feel & look. And also the fact these don't cost a bundle. I noticed that some designers are doing this with their prices, just because they look like leather, but they're not & the should reflect that also. I really like these jeans."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is my last time of buying Levis.  Order this model and 2 others at the same time during an Amazon sale. Been wearing the same and models for decades.  The quality and fit of the fabric just isn't there anymore.  One pair got a hole in the upper thigh after the first washing.  All the jeans I bought this time, stretch out within hours of wearing.  I have a 31 inch waist, and if I do not have a belt on these jeans are sliding way down within an hour.  This is after washing and drying 5 times.  Ended up going to Marshall's and getting much higher quality jean for half the price.  Sad  to see a company like Levi let themselves forget about their customers. They are so focused on producing at the loweest price, that they no longer seem interested in producting a quality product.  Too bad"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This one actually keeps the girls in a more upright position - and that's a big deal for a middle aged woman, believe me. I didn't want a molded, balconette type - puleeze! But nothing else seemed to give any uplift. The straps stay put which is usually a problem for me, too, plus the straps are comfortable. The side elastic stretches and gives nicely without being too loose. I really love this thing and I have a drawer full of others I won't bother to wear. I'm a 42C and it was true- to -size for me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I don't even want to take this bra off,  it's that comfortable.  I especially enjoy the wide straps.  I'm starting to get indentations on my shoulders from straps digging in through the years!Not with these straps.  Support is outstanding and looks great under clothes.  Don't suffer with cheaper bras that are not comfortable!The quality of Wacoal bras is outstanding and although they are spendy will outlast most other brands.  However  beware,  as I have bought knockoffs calling themselves Wacoal which indeed were not.(Ebay)  I can tell the difference right off the bat!  Hopefully that is not happening here on Amazon as one reviewer complained.  I can certainly vouch that this is a Wacoal bra.  I have bought several of these through the past 15 years."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just recently received my waist cincher (medium) it's the first corset-like product that I will be using after gaining some weight and being limited as to what I can do as far as Exercise goes which is almost non-existent. This garment is made with great quality. I hear the customer service is Excellent which is very important and most people say these undergarments are Better than Spanx! Also some people said not to go by the chart well I looked at it and was between numbers so I went with the higher NO. I don't know if I should have done that or not so I have a Black Medium. From what I can tell it holds you in well and I really like it a lot, I now know where to go for these type of products and Highly Recommend!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This waist cincher is perfect to accentuate an hourglass shape. The inner-contour bands in the middle help create a fierce silhouette. I regularly wear steel-boned corsets, and find this to be a great summer alternative. For comfort, I suggest wearing a corset liner underneath if you wear for an extended period of time. Next time I order, I will size down as it is not snug enough for my taste. Remember to buy cincher by waist measurement. Pair with a bullet bra for an extreme look that is bound to turn heads."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This waist cincher is perfect for those who don't have a whole lot to pack in, but want a smooth, long line.  I also like it because the garter straps can be significantly shortened, so the tops of my stockings are not down near my knees at the end of the day.  It is comfortable but sturdy - no weird poking or pinching - and it holds its shape throughout the day.  Finally, this is much more visually appealing than most waist cinchers/tummy flatteners out there.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a Rago 6207 high waist long leg panty girdle - every day all day - it is wonderful! It does notshow - I do not have that \"girdled\" look and most of all it gives me a flat tummy. I do not wear pantiesunder, stockings, and only my girdle. The 6207 has no zipper and once it is on forget it. The open crotchmakes life easy in the bathroom. At first my girdle is tight, then it is comfortable and then I just forgetthat I have it on. I am not at all self conscious and I look great - have had many compliments and no qustionsat all - women's girdles are not just for women. I have three 6207's - one on, one in wash and one in the drawer.I would not leave home without my girdle - no ride up, roll over and a flat tummy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I hate bounce. I'm a 36DD, and like high impact sports. While this bra didn't completely eliminate bounce, it certainly reduced it to a more comfortable level. I can do intervals in this, play basketball, and jump around to my hearts content. I still sometimes do the double bra technique with this bra, but this is probably the only bra I'd wear on its own for high impact sports.Upside: best bra around for minimizing bounceDownside: Ugly. No getting around that. You can't wear cute little tops with this. But when you don't have painful bounce, you can live with a little more coverage."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "It just killed me to have to pay this much for a bra but I have to say these are exceptional bras in every way. No bounce, true to size, feel great, look great. They are so pretty that you just want to wear them without a shirt so everyone can see them! Size runs true to form on these so order size you normally wear. Colors are fantastic and the material is so smooth and feels so good. I wore one walking today and it really helped my back, which usually hurts when I walk long distances."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just received my bra in the mail and I am so happy.  I am a 36F (I bought a size 2) and this is the first sports bra that actually fits without making my breasts ooze out in my arm pits.  I have run around the house, jumped up and down and no bounce, NONE! Yay! I will be using it for roller derby and hopefully I will stop getting penalties for having my elbows out because I couldn't tuck them close to my body.  This really feels like my centre of gravity has changed.  Very pleased. Oh and my husband says it's very flattering also."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased this for my husband as a gift.  He says it's the best thing he's ever gotten.  He loves the space inside and the separate compartments.  Since he works in 48-hour shifts, he uses it every single day.  He said that the rubber bumpers on the bottom of the bag are perfect for keeping the leather out of counter messes both at work and at home, and that he is able to fit all of his daily bathroom supplies inside with room to spare.  Great quality!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered 2, and actually preferred the tan finish (tone was gorgeous, and more even in appearance).  The tan was missing a \"leg\" however; it has rubber to keep it off the countertop, so I sent it back.  I kept this one for my husband, which I intended as a gift.  A bit of miscommunication has them refunding instead of exchanging the tan, no biggie, we shall figure that out. The bag(s) itself is great.  I can't wait to see how it ages, it, like few products these days, appears to be built for the long haul.  I anticipate it will look great for years, if it's cared for."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these gloves a few months ago because I needed a good pair of running gloves when my morning runs were normally in the 25-30 degF range. I purchased them based on other reviews that claimed that they'll keep your hands warm while still letting them breath.The woven material sure lets your hands breath but that also makes my hands feel cold. As your body and hands move while you run (or even just walking) you'll feel the cold air hitting your hands and it was uncomfortable for me. My hands didn't feel frozen but it was unpleasant. I definitely wouldn't call it warm. When the temps were closer to 40 degF my hands felt better but you still feel the cold air.They seem to be a good quality glove that fits me well and should last a long time but they're not some magical fabric that manages to keep your hands warm while at the same time letting cold air hit them. My BS detector must be on the fritz."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, so I wear cotton granny panties,  It's my fanny and I like 'em!  These are pricey but worth it:  such fine quality cotton, not really 'suede' feeling, but a thicker and very soft smooth fabric, care to hems and stitching, and the soft lace trim at the waist is not itchy, doesn't bunch, and indeed looks and feels feminine.  They've only been through a few machine washings and dryings, but they come out looking just lovely.  Yeah, I should hand wash and drip dry, they'd probably last until my last breath on earth, but .....  these are durable goods and they handle my abuse quite well."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased this bra on sale at TJ Maxx awhile back.  When I tried it on at the store, I was amazed at how well it fit--the bra sat smoothly against my body, fitting snugly around my curves, with no gaping or riding up anywhere.  I am a B-cup, and I like that this bra has just a slight padding to it, yet doesn't feel like armor (which is how my husband has described some of my other padded bras!).  The smooth satin is very comfortable to wear, and the various colors are very attractive--I actually have the \"snake,\" which is simply a pretty spotted green with some purple flecks.  I knew from the moment I purchased this bra that I was going to want to buy another one like it; I even saved the tags.  Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm not sure what to think.  I have been searching for this color for a long time.  I finally found it and it wasn't $35, so I bought it.  It is a beautiful dark brown.  I got the right size.  The only thing is, I just don't like under wire bras.  I had hoped that it wouldn't be so bad, but alas, under wire is under wire, and it is annoying.  So, I will wear it, but not as often as I'd like."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a great bra. It's comfortable and provides good support. I also like the shape of it. It comes down low enough so I can wear lowcut tops without the cups peeking out. It also doesn't ride up my back, which is a plus. I've had that problem before.My only complaint is that after a while (say, a few months), it does start to stretch out a little bit, so it's not as supportive as it was in the beginning. That said, I really like this bra and I continue to buy it simply because I haven't found any other bras that I like as much as this one."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this bra and ordered a few of them because finding a bra that fits is like heaven. An uncomfortable bra is like ill-fitting shoes and makes me cranky. I had purchased this size/style in a store so I knew it would fit. In general, I think the cup might run a little small. The thing I like is that the padding is thick enough that no one can tell when you're &#34;cold&#34; when wearing a think t-shirt, yet I don't feel overstuffed."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear nothing else and needed a new pair of boot cut. I might start wearing something else if Levi doesn't do something about what's going on with its labor force. C'mon Levi! You're charging enough for each pair of these things. Spread it around to those who make them for you. Had to be said.I really might never buy them again after recent news, but you want only to know about the jeans. They're Levi's, which, despite Brett Favre's claims, are still the best, albeit overpriced.Mainly, I can always count on them fitting, and once again these do. Best for me this time is the 35\" waist, which is unusual for Levi's."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased this to use under a vintage 1950s gown with a nipped waist. I was sure it would ache immediately but I was able to comfortably wear it for hours, to a wedding, and dance without problem. I liked it so much I've been finding reasons to use it with other dresses as well, and I purchased one in black too.I'm one of those people that is a different size for the waist than the hip, and rather than following the recommendations to go with the larger size (in my case, hip) I ordered the size appropriate for my waist, wanting more control there. Because of this the lower seam tends to roll up, but generally stays put. There are hooks for garters so if you were to use this with thigh high stockings, I'm sure it would take care of the problem with the bottom end rolling up a little."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I don't like this waist cincher. I bought a size small, I'm 5'9&#34;, 145lbs. Even at my height, the back of the cincher was too long in the back. And because I have a curvy behind, it immediately flipped up at my behind.  It is impossible for this thing to lie smooth if you have junk in the trunk. So in addition to waistline bulges, now I have a fold of power mesh on the top of my rump. It didn't do a good job of pulling me in.  I think it's no better than Flexees. It gives the waistline a very odd shape. I regret buying it. I will still stick with Squeem."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this cincher to wear under a dress in an upcoming wedding I'm attending.  I estimated the size I needed, and ordered a Large.  I'm 5'4&#34; and 170 (and losing!!)  I was nervous at first, because it didn't seem like it would fit, but once I got it on, it fit great!  No struggle to get on either.  I pulled my dress on over it and Voila! The hour-glass shape I was looking for!!  It flattened my belly and pulled in my sides over my hips!!  I'm so happy with the results!!  I kept it on through the evening last night to see how it felt as it settled on my body, and it doesn't seem to shift.  There is a slight amount of rolling on the top, but its really not bad.  I'm very pleased with this undergarment!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "this product is well made.  It really works as far as holding in your waist and improving your posture.  The only issue that I have is that you can definitely see the boning and snaps under anything that's not too thick (i.e. a t-shirt or a tank)  I won't be able to wear this under any fitted dresses......  oh well, I will continue to wear it for at least 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week and see if I get the results that others have stated they got."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Received this item before expected.  Delivery was excellent.  I was afraid that the measurements would be incorrect on thewebsite but I chose a large and it fits perfectly.  It is a little hard to put on but once it is on it does exactly as stated.  There areno love handles on my side and it makes any garments have a perfect look and my waist looks much smaller.  If anyonewants to order this product please use your hip measurements and not your waist.  Buying this item in too large a size will not letyou get the effect desired."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm not really a plus-size gal (12/14), but I have chunky thighs and I hate the thigh-high mushroom effect, so I went with plus size just to be safe. No luck - these were incredibly tight and very unflattering. There was also an odd greasy residue on the cardboard insert in the package. Of course you can't return stockings once opened, so now I'm stuck with these useless stockings. They really are pretty to look at draped over a hanger, but if you have large thighs, that's about all they're good for.Fortunately, the capable folks at Sock Avenue were able to help - they recommended Leg Avenue's Plus Size Sheer &#34;Lace Top Stockings with Backseam,&#34; which were, oddly, so much stretchier they were almost too big, which was actually perfect. Now I just wish I knew what to do with these!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is an update to my first review.  The band is showing signs of wear after only a few months.  I am disappointed, but still think it's a decent watch.Original review:  This is a lovely watch that weighs almost nothing and lies flat on the wrist.  I have some very exclusive and expensive watches - but I am wearing this one because it is so comfortable.  The only negative so far - it has come loose a few times.  I think I buckle it properly - maybe it catches on something.  The band has an amazingly silky feel.  Excellent value!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've had this watch for awhile now and really like it. I think its pretty and goes well with all my bracelets, silver and gold. It runs well and unlike most other comments, i don't have a problem seeing the time. The only issue to aware of is.. if you don't clamp the latch properly, it will fall off after wearing it all day!  That has happened to me twice. Both times someone had picked it up off floor and gave it back..i didn't even know it was gone!  I got lucky. Otherwise, its great!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a beautiful watch, nicer in person than the picture.  I love the two tone look to wear with gold and silver jewellery.  I agree with other reviews that the second hand is too prominent and gets mistaken for the minute hand, but this is something you get used to after a while, I've been wearing it for about a month now.  it keeps perfect time so far and the face is medium size and suits my wrist (medium to large).  Very sleek and classic looking, can wear to work or going out."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "these are the best bras for a full busted woman.  i wear 36J and had to go up a cup to 36JJ because i am 20 weeks pregnant.  love my panache !  always great coverage.  And wish they were made in a nursing bra!  by the way i have had full busts my whole life and find that panache fits me the best. I dont have a wide back just very large breasts. so the cup always fits well and they are easy on the eye. wear your right size ladies! and you will never look bad!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered this bra with hopes based on reviews. Unfortunately, when it arrived, I was disappointed to find that it was not only completely sheer, but had no padding or molded cup. It is not a sexy bra either. It does offer a good deal of support, however. I went by the size chart as I am normally a 40G (north America) and purchased a 40F as per recommendation. Unfortunately the cup was a bit small, but as I live in Canada, return shipping is too expensive. Within an hour of trying on the bra, I went back to look at it, and noticed that the seam in the middle of the cup was already a centimeter unraveled.  But as I did not notice it before I removed the tags, there is nothing that I can do other than to stitch the hole up myself. I feel that I paid too much for a bra with a hole in it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra is extremely comfortable, affordable and pretty too! My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars is that the straps can't be adjusted very much. Right now as it is I'm at maximum shortening of the straps, so as I wear it and it stretches I can see some adjustments in my future. Nothing my sewing machine can't fix though. All in all I'd recommend to someone like me whose been searching for a comfortable yet pretty bra for their girls (I'm 32GG)."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I really wanted to like this bra. Well, I really wanted it to fit. I have a short torso, so the wires on this bra are simply too long, and poked me in the arm pit as soon as I sat down. If you are petite, this bra might not be the best shape/size for your frame.Despite that issue, the cup size was also a little large - I am typically a G cup, but another site recommends an F for this bra company. I would recommend trying a cup down if you are above a D size.The fabric on the bra is pretty and I love the sheer look. I would have loved to have been able to keep the bra."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a nicely constructed bra. The best part is the thin straps and sexier appearance than most large bras. I have gained quite a bit of weight since having my last child and have thus found these to not be as comfortable for me anymore. The top of the underwire digs into my underarms and hurts. If you have a large cup size and a small frame with not very much side tissue, then this would be the perfect bra. Having a large frame (unfortunately) and a large cup size, I find the Elomi bra to be a better fit. Panache makes absolutely beatiful bras, though. Also, in terms of construction, I don't think these are quite as sturdy or well made as Elomi."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered the 32K, per size charts... I think the cups run smaller then the size chart states.The bra is made of a rough material, it rubbed my armpits and cleavage raw after only a few hours.The under-wires poked threw after the second wearing. I only hand washed it.The stitching and seems show threw even heavy tee-shirts...The stretchy straps are a bad idea for large breasts...Overall I am not impressed with the quality of this product. I would not recommend it to women with large breasts."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a 36 H now that I am nursing, and the medium ++ fits perfect. This is by far my most comfortable nursing bra. I wear it around the house, while sleeping, running errands, and even playing racquetball. The fit is like a sports bra (it does create a &#34;uniboob&#34; look) but it has great support.  If you are looking for a nursing bra for busty women with better shaping for going to work or dressing-up, I recommend the Bravado Bliss Nursing Bra, but definitely buy a Double Plus (or a few) for your days off."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered this bra per the product guidelines..I am very large busted, and I thought this would be a good nursing bra--for not having wires.The only thing this bra is good for is for holding nursing pads in overnight.  There's no support--none.  I can't even imagine it would support me if I was smaller, either.  The fabric is fairly decent, but I am surprised at the positive reviews from the larger busted lady reviews on here.  I recommend the Goddess bra, or glamourmom nursing tanks--this bra was seriously a joke!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very comfortable and easy to nurse with. Great support for hospital, around house day and night, not so much for work/going out bc much like a sports-bra in shape (or lack thereof).If this is your first pregnancy, and you'll be nursing, you'll need several nursing bras. Several, because baby daily with spit milk right back at you and you'll be sleeping in them too when your boobs weigh down with milk.  Frankly, it's uncomfortable not wearing a bra.In a nursing bra, one-handed latching/unlatching is important so you can hold baby with the other hand.  This bra has super easy latches.  It's excellent."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this nursing bra. It's super comfy and fairly supportive. But, it fits like a sports bra, giving you a &#34;uni-boob&#34;. Especially if you have a larger chest like me. However, it's perfect for wearing around the house! The one thing I don't like about this bra is the line on the side of your boob. It shows under clothes and can be annoying. As a side note, I wear a 42H while nursing and the Double Plus XL fits just fine. :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I never imagined myself getting a sports-style nursing bra as I have never found sports bras, on their own, to be particularly supportive for me.  Without any special gadgets I could spot, I didn't understand how such a style of nursing bra would do well for me.  However, this one had so many positive reviews and I had heard such good things about the company...This bra is far better than I expected.  Yes, it's a \"sports bra\" but I was amazed at just how supportive and shapely it is.  I am completely comfortable in this bra (thanks to the lack of underwire as well as the incredible support), whether it be day or night.  The clasps are easy to work as well without too much fiddling."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Although the fit was good and the bra itself was comfortable, I returned this bra due to the uncomfortable &#34;buckle&#34; type adjuster on the strap.  I could constantly feel it digging into my shoulder blades.  Since I wear this type of bra all day (not for sports), the straps have to be comfortable.  Instead I'm keeping the Lily of France Sport in Action sports bra.  The straps aren't adjustable but fit fine on me and feel divine compared to the Natori straps."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm looking for a sports bra that gives me really good separation of my breasts. I hate my boobs touching each other when I'm exercising, or really any time. I'm anti-uniboob! I have some nice regular bras that do the job, but no sports bras. I wish someone would find one that doesn't cost a fortune and let me know. I'm usually a 34 C. I tried that and it was *way* too small in the cups, really smooshed me together. Now I have a 34 D. It's a better fit, and it mostly separates. I don't know if going up to a 34 DD would give me the fit I want or not."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I live in flip flops, but my feet tend to hurt if I walk in them too much, for example in the mall.  However, this is not a problem with my Slap 2's.  Amazing cushiony comfort, it really does feel like walking on a cloud (as one reviewer said).I'm a 6.5 usually, so decided to go with the 6, and I'm glad that I did.  It fits nicely.  The sandal itself looks very durable. What I like most about this product is that my feet does not slide around in the sandal.  It's like it creates a nice little soft (but not too soft) pocket for my feet.  Excellent product!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn Reef's for many years. I have a very high arch and narrow foot so it can be a challenge to find a snug enough fit. These sandals envelope my foot and embed it far enough that it gives great support. The arch is superior to any Reef sandal I've tried. They are not too light and therefore are more durable. While I only wear these indoors as a house slipper, I am sure they would be comfortable walking over most road surfaces, including gravel.  I don't suggest that this sandal is only for narrow feet. Through repeated wearings they have grown much looser on my foot, but that is what I have grown to expect considering most sandals are made for and average size feet. I highly recommend these sandals."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've previously had the Fannings and loved them. I thought since it was the same company that makes these they'd be very similar. I was very disappointed to learn that was not the case. These state they're medium and I've never had an issue with a 7M before, however, when I try to slide my foot in the back strap near the heel is too narrow and cuts into my arch. It's extremely uncomfortable and I had to return them due to the discomfort.I should have just stuck with what I'm used to. I knew the Fannings were comfortable and I these looked so similar I thought I'd give them a try. Even from looking at the photo of these the straps don't look like they're squeezing the foot but either I received an item that was put together wrong or the shoe is the photo is just better.I hate complaining and returning but I really had no choice on these. Looks like everyone else has had success."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I live in these shoes.  This is my third pair of Newports, and it's one of the only sandals that I literally wear until they fall off my feet.  I get years of wear from every pair.  Of all the Keen sandals, these seem to be the truest fit.  They also have the thickest soles and heaviest toe bumper for foot protection when using them for hiking.  I even use them for backpacking when I'm on trails that are not too technical.  The support is excellent, and the quality is simply the best I've found in any sandal.I bought these through Amazon and the shipping was fast and accurate.  I will buy another pair and I highly recommend these to others."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like the Keen concept, but they are cheaply built and unacceptable as a beach sandal.  I have the black model and they have turned a dark purple.  The sun or salt water may have caused the change.  I wore them everyday during my Culebra vacation.  The shoes are not sturdy enough to use on a gravel beach.  When I hiked a rocky path, I had to be careful or I would twist my ankle.  My companion wore Teva sandals they proved to be a better casual sandal."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these for my husband for a snorkeling trip. These are his favorite shoes. Even after walking in water, the feet immediately feel dry once out of the water. They never smell, which is different from other water sandals. The toes are secure, the bottoms heavy and well made, and the inner cord is easily adjusted to provide a good fit. Even after getting them dirty with mud, they wash off easily with water and look like new. He even wears them with socks now that the weather is colder. A very well-made shoe/sandal."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Great sandal. I got to replace some aqua socks I've had for years that fell apart while at a water park.  These are super comfortable and can easily be work with the heel strap on or off. Look kinda clunky, but that's the idea.  Love the toe protection, which has saved me many times. I would definitely get again.UPDATE 5/14/13 - Just came back from Maui and these were awesome. Really helpful to have on at the hot beaches and able to navigate the lava rocks.  No separated toe injury from \"sandal syndrome\" either.  These were my go to shoe for the trip and best comfort. Highly recommend!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "perfect fit right out of box... I read all reviews and, asked people whom wore Keen sandals; all said order 1/2 size larger. Great advise! Do as suggested. Wore all day, without any rubs or discomfort.I had have tried both New Balance & Merrill barefoot shoes to use while sailing. When the deck got wet from heeling and, spray I lost footing. Ended up on floor, real close to capsizing. Not again. I like the feel Keen sandals so much I now own 2 pair.A shoe to try that's not a sandal, Northface! Nice, too."}

I've been wearing these in a Big Kid size 6 because it's a 39 but nice and wide for me and they cost less so I have them in about 6 different colors - WASSA (the hubby) loves them we wear them walking the dogs cause we usually end up in the water at the beach or in the creek and he thinks they're perfect - I get the one's with the closed in heel for myself,  I'm a little paranoid about cutting my feet on rocks and coral which can end up in an ugly infection ... really really comfy and you just can't kill 'em - throw them in the washer or a bucket with soap to freshen if they get a bit on the nose."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I originally purchased this sandal with the intent of doing some light hiking and river-rafting.  The sandal held up remarkably well!  The only reason I haven't given this five stars is because when wearing this sandal barefoot, the inside of the arch-supports have a little nodule that rubbed uncomfortably against my feet.  HOWEVER - I have extremely flat feet, so maybe it's me and not the sandal.  I would still recommend this footwear, as it is tough enough to hike in, and comfortable enough to get wet in.Pros:- Tough, rugged, versatile- Stylish- Great Value (I paid $64, retails for $80)- Sizes for all (I wear a 15)- Closed toe (no more stubby-stabby!)- Good tread for hiking- Easy elastic and clamp tiesCons:- Rough spot on the inside arches- Sizes run about 1/2 large"}

In one side pocket I have a little Vera Bradley journal.  In the other side pocket a tiny credit card wallet and lipstick.  The main compartment is big enough for my Epi-Pen, a pill case, my cell phone, and one Baggu, and that's it.  I've ordered a Le Sportsac Frame Bag and that will replace this as soon as it arrives."}

Received my first pair of the hi cut and the first thing i did was try them on to see if the stretcth, smooth, soft feel was the same as the string bikini. Dead on with size and comfort. i'm 6 feet with a 36 waist and the size 5 is my favorite. Very sexy looking and the fabric holds me in better than any panty. The support is fantastic. The only thing i would change is lower the backside 1-2 inches. With the comfort and fit of this panty,a minor complaint. I'll be buying these in every color. Love them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The backing of the bag that gives its nice shape is made of some kind of wood or other hard material or cardboard.  I was excited to get a \"man purse\" to carry my cell phones instead of attaching them to my belt.  I placed the phones and tried to close the snap button but the backing broke.  It cracked.  I didn't even use the bag yet and the backing cracked in half.  The backing could not even withstand pressure applied to close the snap buttons.  What a major disappointment.  They couldn't make it out of something less brittle?  Useless."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This item is made from a loosely woven fabric and does not in any way resemble the durable military messenger/map pouches.  The strap is narrow, which would cut into the shoulders, too short, and also constructed of a low thread count weave.  This is not recommended for much of anything.  I left it sitting on the table on my patio for two days, and upon moving it, found that in this short space of time, the sunlight had bleached the exposed part several shades lighter to a yellowish tone.  The bang is now two toned.  Since the material is so low grade, I can't even cut it up for scraps.  It is going into the trash can."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These work perfectly in my Lowa hiking boots (Zephyr model). The boots run a little small so the high volume insoles made things a little bit too tight. These have a medium amount of cushioning at 1.6mm (some other SOLE insoles, including some I have, are 3.2mm). I can tell a difference.These insoles are supportive without feeling overly aggressive. I even got them completely soaked with water when it thunderstormed and after air drying in front of a simple fan for a day they appear as new. Actually, even when wet they still appeared (and functioned) perfect.I did not heat them in the oven to mold them. I just trimmed a little, stuck them in the boots, and went for it."}

The Sole inserts are the best non-prescription orthotic grade insoles your can buy over the counter (internet). These will mold to your feet after heating them in the oven for a few minutes. The arch supports and padding are fantastic. They add to your balance and help to align your back and prevent foot injuries. I have at least 10 pair of these and I love 'em. They are the best."}

{"label": 8, "raw": "This jacket is not meant to keep you warm in freezing temperature. It is good for running a few miles or wearing it over a sweater on a rainy day. I got an Extra Small Maroon and it's 35 inches around the chest area and 32 on the waist area.It can be rolled up to a ball and doesn't take a lot of space if you take it on a trip. It is durable and VERY light weight. It is water resistant and the hood covers your head, if you zip it all the way up it covers your mouth and just leaves your eyes and your nose exposed. Recommended for those who are always out hiking in the morning or joggers in cold weather. If you wear this on a 40 degree weather you will feel the temperature for sure. The color is nice and design is simple. The fabric is thin, almost like an umbrella and durable."}

My wrist are thin, and this watch looks great.  The best part about the watch is that it is pretty much waterproof so I don't fear it breaking when I forget to take it off when I for instance wash the dishes.  It is durable, the face can scratch easily but so far I have taken good care of it."}

Opposed to all these toe shoe people that have to or should wash them after every use. Stylin with my fuctional green kicks while I watch the bar bow from the massive weight I just ripped off the floor. (well massive weight for me).

{"label": 8, "raw": "Well I love Dickie's stuff, so I'm biased. Hey, their work clothes hold their shape without ironing, they are water resistant, stain resistant, don't tear easily, and are not expensive. I needed this for my job which requires black or white shirt and I needed long sleeves to cover my tattoos. I am not tall, and my arms aren't that long, but these sleeves were actually perfect for me. I can't say that about most XL button downs I have with long sleeves. I can actually wear a large but I like my work shirts a bit loose so I can move around better without untucking the thing. It is long so stays tucked in pretty good. For wearing untucked it's a bit long but okay enough. I will order more of these just to wear to go to dog park, or even go out swing dancing watching my friend's rockabilly bands."}

That's 2 day shipping (Kentucky to Pennsylvania) and I didn't pay a cent (free super saver option selected). Absolutely hands down the best shipping service I've ever dealt with, I'm totally blown away and cannot offer enough praise. Good work Amazon, good work Prestige, good work Dickies.100% satisfied."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit. The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in, but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much. We're required to wear these where I work, and tucked in, so the strange (boxy almost) cut makes it keep coming untucked. The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit, I would but a million!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love Dickies products. They fit nicely, look good and, most importantly, last a long time due to the rugged construction. I only wear short-sleeved shirts because I'm always hot. The shirt and the color are perfect for me to wear in my business casual work environment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, when you take it out of the plastic bag that it comes in, it has a pesticide smell to it. You really have to wash it before wearing to get rid of the smell. But, I do understand why they treat the shirts with the pesticide, it sure beats the alternative."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The price is a bit high, as you can get this at Walmart for much less, but I have found that Walmart sells \"seconds\" or defective material most of the time.  For work, seconds or defective material is usually not a problem with me; I just want to let people know, that cheaper in price usually means cheaper in quality.If you are not familiar with this type of fabric, wear an undershirt as you will have \"wear spots\" in places that you usually don't have with all cotton material.  It's best to break your skin in slowly over time if you are like me and don't wear undershirts.  The sore spots I'm talking about is your nipples.  I hope Amazon allows me to use that word."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The pants have so much wrong with them, plus they look awful. It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer, both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them.1.) CARDBOARD PANTS. They are STIFF. Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard.2.) They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear. Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants.

Although there are so many different types of Dickies (different styles, quality, and colors), to choose from on the Amazon website, these pants are very impressive.  The seller has advertised these pants with a complete and accurate description. The delivery was very fast, the packaging was excellent.  All the men in my family who have ordered these Dickies pants are enjoying their purchase, they are happy, impressed, and would recommend these pants to others who would be interested in a great quality work pants.

I Recommend the wink pants for men,  i have had them for 2 months and there is no problem.

There are pockets enough for phone, watch & chain, pocket knife, handkerchief, wallet, sunflower seeds,whatever the aspiring Codger needs during his day.

The denim is a real heavy weight that feels great on the legs. The pockets look good and are well sized. The jeans cold wash well. I hang them dry and they take quite a while. They've really made me feel more confident about how I look. Nice surprise given I never heard of the brand before."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Jeans that fit well and actually sit AT the natural waist, these are them. So many of the recognizable brands of jeans makers out there are producing product that sit below the natural waist. And I think we all know what that translates to when one sits, bends or crouches. Frankly, I don't want to see that, and I don't think others do either. Thank you Carhartt for recognizing this.The B18 Trad-fit jean fits comfortably. They have the right amount of room in all the places one needs the right amount of room without the baggy-ness. These are REAL jeans, not those single stitch, thin denim things sold by the people with sail boats on their catalog covers.  Made of nice, sturdy denim with solid construction, these will hold up well on the work-site. And, if you're a casual social event type, their quality construction and good looks pair well with a shirt and sports coat.Nice jeans that can both work and play."}

These jeans also have seven belt loops; other brands only have six.  The pockets are extra deep.  The waist is slightly taller than other jeans I have; that is the button is higher up my waist than others, but it is not uncomfortable.  Overall, very impressive jeans."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are my favorite shorts. Made from the same 12 oz. fabric as Carhartt's iconic heavyweight pants, these are probably THE hardest-wearing shorts you can buy. Duluth Trading Co. makes work shorts in a slightly heavier (\"Fire Hose Canvas\") fabric, but Carhartt's are probably a better value unless the DTC ones happen to be on sale.They're practical, too; the hammer loop and especially the low-profile side pockets are incredibly useful for carrying tools, pens, notepads, and whatnot. I find myself using them constantly.The only downside of these heavy-duty shorts is the flip-side of their greatest virtue: the incredibly rugged fabric. It gets hot. I live in the Pacific Northwest, where summers are generally mild, but if I lived in the southern United States, I'd definitely get the lighter-weight shorts."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Carhartt makes some of the best quality clothing for men, which generally is considered &#34;work-wear&#34;.  By far one of the leaders in this area. In this case the t-shirt is well made and fits appropriately. This is not some fashion fitting item, its a product designed to fit but to allow freedom of movement and comfort. You can't go wrong buying this if you are looking for tough, comfortable and well made clothing for work/leisure/ or whatever. I always look to Carhartt for tough well made clothes that are # 1 in quality."}

The zippers under each arm for the side vents are ripping out.I didn't notice it at first, but then I felt it. They are coming through the sleeve fabric and making holes. On both arms.I love this coat, so this a bummer. So I dropped from 5 stars to 3."}

When I take it off, after 3-5 mile runs, the inside may be moist but I'm not.  I have another rain jacket that leaves me feeling clammy after a brisk walk so I can appreciate the difference .  I love it!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "A friend told me these are the most comfortable undershorts ever so I ordered a pair. They were not cheap but they are ridiculously comfortable. Wearing them all day on planes and in airports last week I never noticed i was wearing them. They didn't bind, ride up, get bunched, or anything else that normal boxers would. I recommend these to ANYONE of ANY weight who finds current men's underwear uncomfortable. I have always used the briefs versus the boxers but I thought I would try these. THey are made the same but not quite as comfortable. Still worthy of 5 stars versus any other version but I would go with the briefs. FYI, I ALWAYS have preferred boxer shorts, so even if you prefer boxer shorts you may want to try the briefs version or you will miss out on some of the great comfort."}

They'd rip in a deep squat, they would bunch up very fast (choking my thighs, bunching up on my butt only getting tighter in the front and baggier in the back as I progressed) and I started looking on some online CrossFit communities for a better option. Enter these boxer briefs... while I never thought I'd pay 20$ for a single pair of underwear... they are well worth every cent. They give, they breathe, they are snug but not uncomfortable. I also purchased a similar product made by Adidas and love them both equally. Both are now part of my regular fitness gear."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought a few of these Give-n-Go Briefs for my fianc&eacute;, We were a bit uneasy about size but we went with the (MEDIUM) and that was perfect. We were planning a hiking trip and it was going to be sunny and hot and it was! He wore these briefs the whole trip. They are super easy to wash ring and let air dry, in about 15 min depending on your environment The material is lightweight and very flexible with a sturdy waist band. Even after the trip was over they have proven to work at keeping the area dry and comfortable while doing everyday sweaty tasks. They were a great buy and soon we will add more until thats all the drawer will have."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wanted to try out the boxer briefs since I was starting to get tired of the issues related to boxers alone.  I got these and another brand on here and man did that change my way of thinking.  I love these boxer briefs.  They are comfortable, plenty of support, and look good too!  I bought 3 more pairs just 1 week after wearing these.  I highly recommend these.  I will probably buy some more so that I have a pair for each day of the week!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Sizing: I'm 6'3, 220, 37 waist.  The large seems to be too big. They are little loose like boxers, especially in the crotch.  For $18, I would not go this route again.  Hanes sport boxer briefs at the store are about $3 cheaper and fit a whole lot better.  These exofficios also ride up the leg with general wear.Drying:  I did try out the speedy wash/dry.  Yes, they dry quickly.  This is a bonus; however, I have not compared this to other makes with the same general material. Is it really that special?  I don't know, maybe I am missing something.  But these boxer briefs don't seem to be worth the money I paid."}

Yes they are expensive but they don't: bind, cut in, chafe from sweat, and can last several days without their unwashed nature being noticed.As an experiment I washed them in the shower wrung them out and wore them wet under my pants in the south. It was 90 degrees outside and they stayed cool for about two hours then dried. Which was very nice. My girlfriend thought I was nuts and told me so regularly.So I bought 4 more pairs. One boxer, one brief, and two boxer briefs. The 80$ took some consideration and courage but they are that good.A side consideration: I bought them in all colors but white. Don't buy white underwear you plan on wearing for days and washing in the sink. Ha ha."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are definitely some of the most comfortable boxers I've ever worn. That being said, I am not comfortable wearing these in a day-to-day capacity. For hiking and the like, these are great. But I've found they can move around and cause a little chaffing if I wear them during my desk job which is odd, but the truth. These also run quite a bit larger than other boxer briefs, my medium size is almost baggy. Compared to my adidas climalite boxer briefs, which are quite tight, I can feel like I'm swimming in these. If I purchase another pair, I'll definitely be sizing down."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "positives - seems great quality, looks like it will last a long time, washes easily, great to use as workout briefs... but I wouldn't go so far as the say like some people I'll buy a bunch and have them as my daily go-tos.negatives - came with a single loop of elastic coming out from it... I decided not to cut it. hopefully this doesn't unravel some of the elastic lining at the top. Also, the material wasn't quite as I expected as it looks in the pictures. I was expecting it to be a little more smooth, but this still isn't bad at all."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So, purchase a pair of these because I was sick of the 'Hanes' and 'Fruit of the Loom' pairs riding up, sweating through them, and loosing elastic so quickly.  And these are an improvement over the 'typical underwear'.  However, I did also purchase \"Champion Elite Active Fit Boxer Brief 3 Pack No Ride up\", and these fit and wear so much better.  For the money, the Champion Elite is much better!  The ExOfficio still 'rides up', and picking wedges is umcomfortable and embarrassing!  Maybe a small would fit me better?  Not sure, I am a 34 waist and the sizing guideline said to go with a medium.  Not willing to drop another $20 to try the small.......  The material feels nice - smooth and soft.Overall the Champion Elite are a better choice in my opinion, no ride up, and cheaper per pair."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been on a long hunt for comfortable underwear. I hate cotton shorts that stretch all out during every wear. I like the compression shorts that keep their fit but I am always having to pull the legs back down as they ride up from repeated sitting and standing. These shorts are not a tight fitting compression short, but they are slightly snug fitting and not baggy, but the fabric is so slick and comfortable. They keep their shape all day long, and the legs do not ride up and get stuck. I really like them and will be ordering more soon."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I feel silly reviewing underwear, but there you go... this product deserves the praise.  I used to wear cotton knit boxers all the time, but I got tired of them riding up (and having to pull them out of my crotch all the time, causing embarrassing scenes) and getting hot and muggy down there due to the cotton material.  Enter the Give-N-Go Boxer Briefs!They ride in place, no riding up.  They stretch and conform to shape comfortably.  They do NOT hold moisture or odor.  Yes, the price is a bit steep for underwear, and I initially only bought two pairs.  After wearing them for a few days, I immediately ordered five more.  Now I've got one for each day of the week!  :-)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The idea is that you can take a couple pairs of these and wear one while you wash the other in a sink, minimizing the underwear you have to bring on a trip. The problem is that they don't feel that comfortable. There is little to not support, and they feel sort of scratchy on my skin. I always know they are there.Underwear doesn't take that much space so when packing it isn't a problem to take a few extra, and honestly my Under Armour does not wash inferiorly."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Underwear seems to be one of the more individualistic and difficult products for a man to buy.  I had been using a Fruit Of The Loom model of Boxer Briefs for years but when it came time to replace then they were no longer available.  I have tried at least 5 different brands and these seem to be the best fit for me.  Even though (I think) I have a 31 inch waist I ordered a size small and the fit is perfect for my body.  The legs are snug and the waist is just right.  The fabric is very soft and a little sheer but it seems to hold up well.  The legs never stretch out - I tried wearing them on a recent trip to Asia (24 hours door to door) and they never lost their shape plus they were extremely comfortable.  The bottom line is I have found my new brand and model of Boxer Briefs = so far I've bought 22 pair :-) but then again I'm a little OCD."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I usually prefer the compression shorts type boxer brief, but they can be rather suffocating for my nether bits- so I decided to try something a bit more breathable. I have two pairs of the regular Exoficcio boxers and I love them, but I do like a tight fit when wearing jeans so I picked up a pair of these to try out. They ride up a lot, I'm constantly adjusting them all day long when I wear them. It gets old, real fast. I don't think they would have this problem if they were a bit longer on the thighs and slightly tighter. As they are now, they are too short to keep a good hold on your thighs so they tent to ride up during daily movement. I'm not unhappy with the purchase, and I do still wear them on occasion, but I think they could have been designed better."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I travel regularly for work and I now only take a couple pairs of these boxer briefs with me on trips. I've always enjoyed traveling light but socks and underwear can take up a surprising amount of room in a suitcase when you need to plan for more than a week or two. I can now comfortably get by with only two pairs of boxer briefs and a couple pairs of socks (drymax). This pair was purchased to add to my current supply but the original pairs have held up well and I have no complaints about them. If you follow the directions that come with the product, they dry incredibly quickly (a few hours at the most)."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these for my husband who was frustrated with his cotton boxer briefs during long runs and workouts. He reported that these wick moisture very well and is extremely happy. We wash these with our dry fit clothes using penguin wash and hang dry them so that they hold up longer. They truly do dry quickly, so I'm sure they will be fantstic for travelling. They appear to be made very well - quality product. I'll update this again if we find otherwise. He has 4 pairs, so we'll see. Also, these do appear to run true to size."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are, by far, the best underwear on the planet. They stretch and breathe better than anything Under Armour or Nike make. You can wash them in a sink, and they dry in a few hours. They are also very, very resistant to any odor accumulation.They are almost indestructible. I've had a couple of pairs for a few years, which I workout in every day. I stretch and squat with them, which normal cotton underwear just ripped after a couple of months. They are also more comfortable because they do stretch so easily.They're expensive, but they're worth it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "definitely the best underwear I have ever owned. I have tried soooooo many different styles and pairs. I have been hunting for the perfect fit, comfortable waist, something that doesn't ride up the back or the crotch, gives adequate cup support and is ventilated.  This might be the miracle undergarment.  Plus, they actually do dry quickly. I travel light and have actually washed them in the sink. By morning . . . . clean and dry! These have replaced my everyday wear. I don't wear these to the gym, as I prefer something with even more cup support, but for a light workout, these would be great."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought two pairs of these.  Size small, I'm 5'7&#34;, waist 32&#34;.  The fit is good, but I feel like the Under Armour boxerjocks offer much better compression.  Just a tight feel all around.  The problem with both is that they make me hot.  It's hard to wear these on a regular basis because they don't offer the breathing room like regular boxers do.  I was hoping that these ExOfficio boxers were a little &#34;cooler&#34;, but they were not.  I'll be wearing these to play sports, but not for daily use."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are great boxers, they dry quickly, are a nice color, look great and seem like they will last along time. I really appreciate the fact that they can dry super quick and that a travel overseas will not be hampered by too many undergarments. I deducted one star due to the fact that they are a bit abrasive. A bit... not in a really bad way, but when one is used to really soft and comforting cotton, these seem a little bit more unrefined... and couple that with the very high cost... I deduct one star. I would and will purchase more of these, they are super for travel."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've got to say, I never thought as a jeans and work-shirt kind of a guy I'd get all excited about some new underwear, but here I am writing a glowing review!These are the best undershorts ever!I've been a Fruit-of-the-loom kind of a guy for 50 years.  Saw these as a lightning Deal and bought four pair.  Now these are my go-to shorts!  Spendy?  Yup, but worth every penny.  Fast washing and drying.  Can sink-wash them and hang them over the shower-rod and they will be completely dry by morning.  Super comfortable, great waistband.I like these so much, I've added them to my wishlist too!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "5'6 143 lbs, 30 in. waist.  Small fits well.  Not quite as much support as a brief but certainly acceptable.  Material is excellent at breathing/wicking and doesn't turn your backside into swamp### if you end up sweating a lot.I machine wash cold, gentle/delicate cycle, basic detergent, and then air dry.  You can wrap these in a towel or put them into the dryer on low heat+gentle if you need them asap.They seem to hold up well & I continually buy a few pairs at a time to pretend they don't cost much.  I won't go back to cotton."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Recently purchased this product, and I am satisfied withe the quality of this product. Here's a break down of the pros and cons. One of the best pairs of brief I own and I would say it's arguably better than most Calvin Klein briefs and other competitors.Pros:-Highly comfortable-Durable material-Material maintains it's consistency, shape, and tightness. Doesn't loosen after washing or change in any way.-Quick-drying-Length is perfect-Waist band is comfortable doesn't squeeze or irritate at all.-Smooth durable materialCons:- If there is any, you could argue the price for one pair is a bit high, that's for you to decide.Conclusion: I certainly recommend this product, it's just a very well made product. This product does stand out, it's not like the other products."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Years ago these were the best briefs you could buy.  I ordered several packs. So far I have thrown away about one third of the briefs.  Some fit perfectly.  The ones I have thrown out have had the following problems.  About three had the elastic in the leg section so tight I could hardly get them on.  Four had the elastic stretch out within minutes like I was wearing bloomers. A couple seemed to be a smaller size than the rest.Apparently these are made without attention to consistent quality.  Needless to say I won't be purchasing these again.  I guess I'll have to go back to buying Fruit of the Loom.  I don't throw as many of those out and they are much cheaper.  If anyone knows of a good pouch brief out there please let me know."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Shoe tree is well shaped, wood quality is excellent, spring tension is just right for the size (my large size trees fit everything from 10-11.5), and fit and finish is great for the price. Bottom line? Spending an extra 20 bucks to keep your shoes looking and smelling good (and making them last longer) is a no brainer. Go for it, you'll be glad you did.I think this is a well-known tip but I'll throw it out there anyway; sand your trees once in a while to expose new cedar to make sure it continues to work like new."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Definitely high quality. These shoe trees sell as a pair. Two in the box.Spring loaded with a split instep. Force them into the toe of your boot/shoe and push the heel home. The instep widens to mold to the shape of the instep and toe of your footwear and the spring mechanism pushes back against the heel.These trees will break your toughest footwear in within a week.Perfect form and fit, very functional and priced right.I feel safe claiming the mechanics and the form will last a lifetime.I'm very happy with my purchase."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this shoe tree. It is made of cedar wood, it has a nice fragrance to it. I also have found an additional use to using this shoe tree. I have a couple of pairs of shoes that are a tad bit smaller for my foot size. When I put this shoe tree in it, it expands the shoes a bit and these smaller shoes become a lot more comfortable to wear. My suggestion is if you wear a shoe size of 9 or 9.5 buy the 10-11 size. You can squeeze it in and it fills the front of the shoe well.I would recommend this all who wear leather shoes, you need to give them a day's rest with these shoe trees."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am 8 1/2 D, and I got the medium size. It fits well. There is a size chart printed on the box, that doesn't correspond to any of the charts on Woodlore's web site. However, I found a chart in the description for the Allen Edmunds shoe tree that is the same as the one on my box (AE makes Woodlore shoe trees). You can find it here:http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/shoes/email/MensCombinationShoeTree.gifIf you have a narrow or wide shoe, it's a lot more accurate.This is a great shoe tree at a great price."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got these trees and thought they were great at first, They function and fit my size 11-13 shoes and boots perfectly, and they're very easy to use.The only problem is the lack of cedar smell. I ordered FootFitter shoe trees a couple of weeks after these, and the FootFitters are just better all around. The pull-cord feels more sturdy, and the function seems easier, but most importantly, the foot fitters SMELL like cedar.There is a night-and-day difference between the two in terms of smell. So if you're looking for true cedar shoe trees that absorb moisture and leaves your shoes smelling fresh, go for the less-popular FootFitters for the same price (the FootFitters were actually cheaper than the Woodlores when I ordered the second time around/)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased these to help widen some of my shoes while also helping to pull out moisture (as cedar does).  Only problem is I missed the part that says these are MENS.  I thought the M in the sizing stood for Medium Width.  Wasn't written anywhere in the description either.Furthermore, how you're suppose to adjust these to widen them, even if I needed these for men's shoes?  I played with them for awhile, since I figured I would try to make them work in my sneakers.  But for the life of me couldn't figure out how to use them properly.  Maybe I'm just slow or inpatient or both.  But I couldn't figure it out.Shame, since they look great and the quality of the cedar was fantastic.  Thankfully amazon is great & I didn't have any problems returning them."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A clasically-styled and introverted album, Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.  Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely, quiet voice.  But within every introvert is an inferno, and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.If you've never heard Enya before, you might want to start with one of her more popularized works, like Watermark, just to play it safe.  But if you're already a fan, then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the third review of an irish album I write today (the others were Cranberries) and now I'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world. And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way. Okay, I just wanted to say something about Irish  music. Now let's say something about this album. It's great. it's  beautiful. Very good, easy listened music. If you like Enya or you just  want some easy-listened relaxing music. This is the album for you to buy!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is not another lousy Celtic New Age album - it is a genuine piece of music, well written and performed with emotion. It never fails to send shivers up and down my spine for some reason... Ever since I heard Orinoco Flow Enya has cast her spell on me. She is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic. On this album every song is as perfect as it can get on a pop record, with melodies that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain. I have every Enya album to date, but this one seems to be particularly special. A must for any music lover!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Enya is in a class all by herself.  She envokes feelings and images that take you out of reality.  So many others have copied her sound (ala James Horner in TITANIC) that it's easy to see how much of an influence she has been.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a classic album.  From the emotional first track instrumental to the enchanting &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, Enya has created a pallete of wonderful pastimes and tragic metaphores here.  Yes, I would consider this pop/new age music.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  There are a number of people that don't like Enya.  There are jokes on South Park about her.  And that's good.  It shows how much of a musical force she is.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a good collection of material from a very important artist, who I hope will never give up her love of music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This,is the type(and caliber)of album that is(sadly)missing,from todays(pathetic)music scene!!\"Foolin'Around\"became an INSTANT classic,\"Good Thing\"is a painfully TRUE,song,and \"All is not gone\"is a beautiful,HOPE-instilling track!! The entire,album is good,but these three songs,are the CREAM of the crop!! I miss,the days,when women,such as these,were APPRECIATED,for creating thought-provoking beautifully sung ballads,INSTEAD of being lauded,for marketing,sex-appeal!! Oh,well,I can always pop this \"gem\"into my player,whenever,I'm craving quality musical offerings!!As it is,I'm going to be playing the surfacing,OFF,of this disc,in the following weeks!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Many bands have a long time to perfect the songs for their first album resulting in a solid debut. This may be the case for The Cars (although Candy-O is great too). This album contains classic songs like Just What I Needed, You're All I've Got Tonight, Bye Bye Love, and Moving In Stereo. It's a crime that this band never got the credit they deserved. They created catchy, sometimes quirky, rock songs with a good balance between rockin guitar and cool keyboards. Elliot Easton's guitar playing is superb as he always plays for the song and not just to show-off. The vocal phrasing of Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr (rest in peace) is excellent (even if I didn't always understand the lyrics). A classic album that must never be forgotten!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I originally had the Cars debut on 8track twenty something years ago--The tape pulled out (remember how 8 tracks did that?) so I bought the record album--after playing it soooo many times I was able to see through it--I  went and bought the cassette--needless to say--I wore it out too. I now  have the CD and am trying my hardest to wear it out. The format may wear  out but great tunes never die--I must have listened to the Cars debut album  over a thousand times--it's still great. A classic among classics."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "What can I say about the Cars first album. The Cars debut album has to be one of the most impressive albums that I have ever heard. Why can't bands make albums this great anymore? Three big hit singles \"Good Times Roll\",\"Just What I Needed\", and \"My Bestfriend's Girl\". As well as \"Bye, Bye Love\", \"Moving in Stereo\", and \"YOu're All I've Got Tonight\" that each get a lot of radio play as well. This is one of those rare albums that is great from start to finish, no filler here."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In my view, this album by itself represents the birth of New Wave (that is, before it had a name).  When the Cars released this, their first, there simply was no other sound like it--and it would take years before other artists even came close to reproducing the cool, beat-laden, tech-heavy resonances of such songs as Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl, Just What I needed, You're All I've Got Tonight, and the terrific combination of Moving in Stereo and All Mixed Up.  In short, mock all you want the haircuts and vapid lyrics of the boy bands which came later, but this one is real, hard, and as original as it gets."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The Cars was one of the most original bands to come out of the late 70s/early 80s, a band that helped set the yardstick for New Wave. This was their first album, coming out in 1978, and is in my humble opinion to be the best album that the band cut. Just about all of its tracks are great, and not just the hits \"Just What I Needed,\" \"My Best Friend's Girl\" and \"Good Times Roll.\"If you are a fan of New Wave music, then you will love this album. Heck, even if is just that you fondly remember the music of the late 70s/early 80s, then you will love this album, too. Do yourself a favor, and buy this album!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's ridiculous how many bands nowadays blatantly rip off the Cars without anyone calling them on their crap.  \"Stacy's Mom,\" anyone?  Weezer or Hot Hot Heat, perhaps?The reason for all of this idolatry is, of course, because the Cars' debut album is still one of the freshest and most vital pop albums ever.  The record was released in 1978, and it never ceases to amaze me with just how timelessly perfect it still sounds.With simple, catchy, and infinitely memorable songs, the Cars' debut is the official soundtrack to a good time.  Easily one of the 70s' best.  \"Just What I Needed\" is among my top five favorite pop songs ever."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "There are precious few flawless albums in rock and roll history.  This is one of them.  Just as Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" singlehandedly turned Grunge into a mainstream phenomenon, so it was for New Wave with the Cars' debut album - And just like Nirvana fostered countless unlistenable imitators, so did the Cars. But I have a choice not to listen to all of the bad New Wave that followed this, and I also have a choice to listen to this impossibly catchy album as long as I have functioning ear drums.For those who are only familiar with the Cars through classic rock radio, this is the Cars CD to get.  It's a rare instance where one of the band's original albums is the first choice over a greatest hits package."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album was originally released on and is still distributed by Capitol Records. Capitol's original catalog number is DT 2458 for the stereo LP and T 2458 for the mono LP. The stereo copies were \"duophonic\",meaning they could only be played on stereo phonographs for maximum sound quality. But then again,you'd get good quality sound if you played a duophonic copy on a monaural phonograph. Stereo LP copies of THE BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS were \"duophonic\" also. Hits from this album include SLOOP JOHN B.,GOD ONLY KNOWS and WOULDN'T IT BE NICE?. This album was a best-seller when it was released in 1966. The Beach Boys were still in their teen idol phase then as was their Capitol labelmates,The Beatles and Peter & Gordon. Also then,Brian Wilson began to have problems with drugs. He'd remain with the band in the studio but turned his duties on the stage to Bruce Johnston. All the other songs are good."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "You don't need a rocket scientist to inform you that The Beach Boys' 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" is one of the Top 10 greatest albums ever made. Not much is left to say that hasn't already been said about the album. Song for song, the record is pure perfection. From the youthful abandonment of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" to the dramatism present on \"Sloop John B.\" to the heartugging \"God Only Knows\" (voted the greatest love song of all time) to the poignancy of \"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\" to the chilling \"Caroline No\", there is not one clunker on the whole cd.This newly remastered edition features the entire album in both stereo and mono. In both forms, the album sounds absolutely fantastic. There ies also an excellent booklet filled with some great essays and rare pcitures. Definitey a must have album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am very disapointed! After looking for this album for 10 years, at least I bought it and ... masterpiece?C'mon people! I have around 2000 Rock albums in my collection and I would never placed this not even between the top 100.How could anyone say that Rubber Soul or Revolver are under Pet Sounds? Any 60's Rolling Stone album is one hundred times better. And something else, if this is the sound that shape the American pop music, I might be wrong, but ... where is Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters, Miles Davis, etc? Those are really masters of American music, not The Beach Boys.I can't give to this album more than half star."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "What is the big deal? Wouldn't it be nice and Caroline no are great songs. There's 3 more good songs and a nice instrumental and the rest is filler. Sure, its great for a Beach Boys album but in the great universe of music this is just a really good pop album.I suppose if I'd never heard jazz or classical music I too would think that Brian's use of vibraphone and glockenspiel was some sign of genius. And if I'd never heard the Platters, the Lettermen or Manhattan Transfer I too would think that the Beach Boys were a great vocal band. Brian brought a good sense of vocal and instrumental arrangement together with some good material to create a pop record that had more depth than most at the time of its release. Just keeping it real."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am not a Beach Boys fan.I consider this one of the 4 or 5 greatest albums of all time.The trouble with this album is that it constantly points out the musical genius--and I do mean genius--Brian Wilson was, and leaves you wondering how he could have plummeted to the depths that would hit him within just a few months of PET SOUNDS.As much as I love &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B,&quot; they seem second tier when heard in the context of this album.  &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day,&quot; &quot;Here Today,&quot; &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; and &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; are all first rate Pop.PET SOUNDS also has what I consider to be the greatest Beach Boys track, &quot;Caroline No.&quot;  It is a perfect recording of a heartbreaking lyric."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I collect Beach Boys & this is just another example of the best album The Beach Boys ever put to wax. After they released the CD the first time it contained the mono/stereo versions (which I prefer the mono) with a bonus track. Then a box set devoted to the album. Now they release it like the single CD but, with a DVD to further cement this album as one of the best ever released. I highly recommend this one if your looking to check out what the fuss is all about. Search \"Judemac Forever\" on msn."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Undeniably the Beach Boys masterpiece. This is an album that has transcended the years and will still be played and enjoyed hundreds of years from now. Brian Wilson, inspired by The Beatles &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album, set to work, along with some help from Tony Asher to create one of the most amazing pop records ever made. The digital remastering is excellent,...these songs sound wonderful. And the 24 page book is great. Includes notes by Brian Wilson, loads of photos, track-by-track notes, and a 6 page essay by David Leaf on The Beach Boys and the making of this album. My version has 3 bonus tracks &quot;Unreleased Backgrounds&quot;, &quot;Hang on to Your Ego&quot; and &quot;Trombone Dixie&quot;. This album belongs in all good music collections."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No question, one of wonders of the digital is the chance for a work like this to be remixed in stereo, with an amazing soundstage.  Mark Linett deserves an award for the work he did with the multi-tracks to this album.  I've heard things I've never heard in the hundred times I've listened to  the mono Pet Sounds.  Putting the mono and stereo versions back to back  really shows the aural difference.For all that refuse to accept the  stero version and consider it some sort of sacrelige, hey, you have the  mono version.  But you are really depriving yourself.This classic got a  whole lot better.  For those of you that are Beatles fans as well, we can  only dream of the Beatles work getting the same treatment."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album was made at the same time as Sgt. Pepper and was a unique because it has mono or stereo versions of the songs on the album with different types of songs. Pet Sounds is like Sgt. Pepper except that the Beatles had more unique albums and on most of the songs, the Beach Boys sound like themselves instead of Beatles albums where the Beatles sound different on different songs. Classic Beach Boys songs on here include \"God Only Knows\" \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" \"Sloop John B\" \"Caroline No.\" to name a few. Another bonus track \"Hang on to your Ego\" is great as well. This is a must for any Beach Boys fan."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's true this is one of the best albums of all time. I'm not sure if I'd call it the second best album ever (Rolling Stone), but it is amazing. Even though &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as a whole is great, it's the hits that really stand-out, which include &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;, &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, and &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. But I also really like &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; and &quot;Caroline No&quot;. Other than being a classic among classics, this disc also includes the bonus track &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot;, and the entire album is repeated in stereo on tracks 15-27. For all these reasons I highly recommend getting &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. At least you should see what all the fuss is about."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "PET SOUNDS is without a doubt a wonderful collection of beautiful harmonies and melodies. Each song is an incredibly well-crafted set piece, individual masterpieces when heard separately. The problem is when they are put together in this package, there is a sameness to the songs. Found in the heart of each song is a gentle, haunting melody without an edge. The songs move seamlessly from one to another and this actually works to their disadvantage; they just are not different enough from each other to be fully appreciated in this setting. Unlike SMILE, where Wilson is able to constantly surprise and amaze, PET SOUNDS is a pleasent and sweet series of songs, I enjoy them but they create a sense of comfort rather than amazement."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is universally regarded as the Beach Boys' masterpiece, and who am I to disagree?  You might say that this was the band's peak, but I would say that they actually peaked with the \"Good Vibrations\" single after this.  But Pet Sounds is certainly their peak from an album standpoint.  This album always ranks among the top ten albums of all time in any survey of critics, and rightly so.  If you can't appreciate how great this album is, I feel sorry for you."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I love the Beach Boys as much as anyone.  Let me say that again.  I love the BEACH Boys as much as anyone.  By that I mean I love the Beach Boys who actually live up to their name, singing about the beach, girls, surfing, cars, and Rhonda.This is not the Beach Boys.  It can't be.  Why?  No beach songs!  I thought it was some kind of joke.  All &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes, backed by elevator music.  There's barely any Mike Love on the album at all.Way overrated."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "There is nothing that I can say about this album that hasn't already been said.. But I would like to express my profound moment of discovery when I first listened to it.. I had the preconception that the Beach boys were just a bunch of dumb surfers.. My musical tastes leaned towards jazz, classical, and more progressive rock.. But I kept on seeing this album on lists of the greatest albums of all time so.. I gave it a try. I wasn't prepared for the beauty of this perfect musical mixture of sounds and moods.. It was clearly a very personal record that expressed many feelings I had at the time.. the production is brilliant.. being a big fan of the beatles I immediately heard simmilarities between George Martinand Sgnt Pepper and how they must have been influenced by this record.. This is not surfer music - it is much more.."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "OK, I have read several reviews here giving this masterpiece a two and three star rating and for the reason being that it \"is not the greatest album ever.\" So, if the album does not qualify as greatest ever it gets a **? Wow, that is going to leave a couple million records with * out there. Well, In my humble opinion, this is arguably the greatest album ever. And guess what, this is the only Beach Boys album I own. So don't go calling me some Beach Boy fanatic. But I can respect genius, especially genius that is as far ahead of it's time as this album. Every song is brilliant and in just the right place. I would put it in the category of Led Zeppelin IV, Who's Next, and several other classics. You don't think it is the best ever? So be it, but spare me these ** and *** star ratings, that is ridiculous!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "What can I say? A pop masterpiece, especially if you sequence &#34;Wouldn't it Be Nice&#34;, &#34;Don't Talk&#34;, &#34;Let's Go Away for a While&#34;, &#34;God Only Knows&#34;, &#34;I Just Wasn't Made for These Times&#34;, &#34;Pet Sounds&#34;, and &#34;Caroline, No&#34;. I would compare &#34;Caroline, No&#34; in particular to Bacharach's and David's and Warwick's &#34;Anyone Who Had a Heart&#34;: as good as the genre gets."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "By far the best Beach Boys album (and the best Brian Wilson album, along with the recently unearthed treasure \"Smile\"). The harmonies and lyrics in the songs are perfect, and remain timeless no matter how many times you listen to it or how many years have passed since this masterpeice first hit the shelves. It wasn't a big hit in the States, mostly due to the fact nobody was ready for it. It's such a well-organized and cohesive work, much unlike what people were used to the Beach Boys putting out at the time. They decided to be something more than just a surf band, or a catchy and trendy pop band, something which nobody gave them credit for. Compare \"God Only Knows\" to \"409\" or \"Surfin' Safari\", and you shall understand what I mean. The melodies are perfect, and blend greatly with the vocals. This is a rare album without a single track to be skipped. If you haven't caught on yet, freaking buy this!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is possibly one of my favourite albums - period. The melodies beautiful, the harmony, arrangements.etc were well beyond their time. For a record released in 1966, it sounds amazing on CD. A far superior album to either Sgt. Pepper's and a bit better than Rubber Soul, there are only a couple of songs I don't really like. A tiny gripe I have with the album the melodies on songs such as Do you still believe me are a bit repetitive. Although nonetheless very good. Btw the song 'God Only Knows' is often cited as the album's best but personally I would rank it about 3rd or 4th on the album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the album that kicked off the bossa nova craze in the US over 40 years ago.  In the hands of lesser musicians this style could degenerate into lightweight cocktail music, but not here.  Stan Getz's feathery, soft saxophone playing weaves beautiful melodies over the swaying, dancing Brazilian rhythms.  Charlie Byrd's is terrific on the acoustic guitar and the tunes will get stuck in your head after 3 spins or less.  The only possible complaint is the short playing time -- a mere 35 minutes.This recording isn't as well-known as Getz/Gilberto but is just as essential.  If you like Getz's playing, be sure to get some of his other, non-bossa-nova recordings as well.  (One more caveat: those looking for more vocals by Astrud or Joao Gilberto will be disappointed -- this CD is entirely instrumental.)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's my first CD bought from Amazon and it's one of the best albums of Patti. Different styles but a unique big voice! Hear her Aretha's voice in the track 5, for example! Track 1 is a new version of the first song in her album \"Havana Candy\".  Track 2 shows us her \"Ability To Swing\". Tracks 3-4-10 are beautiful ballads. Track 6 is the reggae one. Tracks 7-8 have a sweet sound. Track 9 is my favourite of the album, in a gospel style."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A blessed union of amazing vocals and outstanding studio musicians make Patti Austin's THAT SECRET PLACE a dazzling achievement.Whether it's jazz or pop, R&B; or gospel, reggae or funk, Austin impeccably delivers a true command of whatever style she tackles.  In this 1994 release, each track allows Patti to effortlessly glide through each song with her penetrating performances.She cooks on tunes like ABILITY TO SWING, a scat-infused invitation to dance , her cover of Aretha's classic ROCK STEADY and the euphoric drive of REACH.  Have fun with her reggae-flavored CAPTIVATED.  Then let your heart melt with SOMEBODY MAKE ME LAUGH, BROKEN DREAMS or the gorgeous STARS IN YOUR EYES.  The album is flawlessly produced by jazz icons Lee Ritenour and Dave Grusin.Patti has certainly deserved wider success in her career, but for those who have wisely followed her know what a treasure she is!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Listening to this album, it's very difficult to realise that she is only 18. She plays the fiddle with a skill way beyond her years, and her delicate soprano voice sings of lost love and heartbreak with such emotion and beauty that touches the heart of anyone who has experienced love gone wrong. This album was just a hint of what was to come, and I had the pleasure of seeing her in concert a few years back, in Toronto. This is Bluegrass at its best. Buy it, you'll love it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "On her 3rd CD Alison Krauss does not break stride.  &quot;I've Got That Old Feeling&quot; is chock-a-block FULL of the beautiful ballads that have made her famous with her angelically emotive voice, but it is also perhaps the best showcase for her ability to perform more up-tempo pieces, such as &quot;Dark Skies&quot; and &quot;Will You Be Leaving?&quot; The supporting cast here performs perfectly.How many albums do you have that have perhaps a few good songs on it, but just as many songs that are just filler - instantly forgettable and barely listenable?  This is a CD with NO filler.  Every cut is a &quot;keeper&quot; and I could just listen to the whole thing back to back over and over again.Alison Krauss is a national treasure, and this recording is one reason why."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I listen to a wide variety of music, and I think that Alison Krauss has the most beautiful voice in all of today's music.  The pop acts of today can't compare.  &quot;I've Got That Old Feeling&quot; has 12 exceptional songs from bluegrass to country including the title song, &quot;It's Over&quot;, and &quot;Wish I Still Had You&quot;.  Not only can Krauss sing, she plays the violin to perfection.  If you haven't listened to Alison Krauss yet, you are in for a treat!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I've had this CD a long time and it's still very enjoyable especially when you're in the right mood. My favorite songs are mostly the kind of wistful ballads where Alison's voice works great. My favorite songs here are \"I've Got That Old Feeling\", \"I Wish I Still Had You\", \"Winter of a Broken Heart\", \"It's Over\", \"Steel Rails\", \"That Makes One of Us\". Well that's half the album right there, and the other songs are good too. The production isn't as clear as more recent stuff, but the musicians are top notch. In the end some albums stick with you more than others, and this one stands out as a keeper."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was the very first cd that we bought when we first got a cd player back in 1995. I loved it then and love it today. It remains a firm favourite. As well as some of her best songs culled from previous albums, this album includes 3 previously unreleased songs. A great mix of country and bluegrass, this is the best from Alison Krauss, along with Union Station, and the Cox Family, from 1987 to 1994. The booklet includes some cute photos of Alison and her brother as children, but unfortunately, no lyrics. But it does have a 2 page newspaper article from 1994 which is interesting. If you only get one Alison Krauss album, then this is the one you need. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Generally speaking, you could say that there two sides to Alison Krauss and Union Station. The softer melodic side is usually with Alison vocally in front, and the faster bluegrass/country side which often has one of the band members on lead vocals.Though I usually prefer the Alison songs, this two-sides concept gives a fine variation and the fast bluegrass tracks demonstrate what great musicians the Union Station are.Among Alison's songs, which are all great, for me the beautiful pop ballad \"Happiness\" stand out, which also has great harmony vocals by banjoplayer Ron  Block.With at least a handful other great pop/country ballads written by various songwriters like Michael McDonald and Mark Simos this is one of my favourite albums by the group."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a great album. Trust me. And what no one seems to remember is that these guys are Grammy Winners - yes, GRAMMY WINNERS -  for Best Instrumental of the Year for the fantastic D.N.A. from this, their debut album. This is a classic example of a band whose image was so strong ( who can forget THAT HAIR !! ) that it often overshadowed their talent ( another fine example is Culture Club ). Unfortunately, it was all downhill from here, as their popularity ( not to mention their creativity and their stability ) quickly waned. Very upbeat, energetic dance pop-rock, with just enough synths and effects to make it stand out in the crowd. My advice : skip the many \"best of\" compilations and go straight to this one. And when you get ridiculed for playing it, just like you did in high school ( you know who you are... ) do the Flock proud and  wear that freak badge with honor."}

Keep looking for love and UFO's and let us know your fascination with modern life.  I love the guitar sound and the hooks make your albums the best.  This and #2 are the classics.  What happened to make you so dull after that.  \"Remember David\" was one of your best songs and \"Suicide Day\" was good, but the rest of the third album, even the tile track was boring.

Songs like \"My Philosophy,\" \"Illegal Business,\" \"Stop the Violence,\" and \"Still #1\" are some of the most quoted/sampled in the last 20 years of hip hop.  If you think you don't know anything by KRS-1, one listen of this cd would prove you wrong  The list of rappers who have sampled or quoted songs on this cd is inexhaustible.  This was big when it came out in 88, and it sounds just as fresh today.  This is a gem among diamonds, a true hip hop classic. Even in Scott La Rock's absence, the production is stellar.  The lyrics are top-notch.  As close to a perfect hip-hop record as possible."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is $hort's first album.  This is where he defines himself as the pimp, player, mack daddy of Oak-town, CA.  It's because of $hort Dog's early work that the Yay is on the hip hop map and this is the album that  started it all.The production on this album is hella tight.  The beats  are bumpin' and the bass is just boomin'.  Even on my stock stereo, the  whole car be rattlin'.  The lyrics are classic $hort.  Who can forget  FREAKY TALES.  This is just 8 minutes of pure pimpin'.  In addition, MACK  ATTACK, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, and LITTLE GIRLS are just tha shiznit.  This  is arguably $hort's best album.This is a definite must have for any hip  hop collection.  Old school Yay Area sound all the way...YOU KNOW!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is where it all started. Every gangsta rapper knows where credit is do.With out this album there would be no 40,snoop or dog pound. There's just a few songs on this album but there very long,most avg over 5 min. This is short's first album and he will always be highly touted for born to mack. The slow lazy high pitch flow that he gives on this album can never be duplicated. All the music was produced by short. The beats are extremly heavy based and simple with a good melody. The hit song on this album is freaky tales, which is almost 10min long! Short comes into his own as a mack daddy and paves the way for all future gangster rappers in the 90's and up. This album was made 1984 and still sounds great even today(not sounding out of date) P.S.Checkout dope fiend beat that's my favorite."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Truth be known, I'd probably keep this over his \"Hits\" disc. I say that because three of his absolute best songs are here in their original form, and some of his other hits border on cheese. Plus there's other good stuff here too. \"Caribbean Queen (no more love on the run)\" was a huge hit, as was the ballad \"Suddenly\", and I think my favorite is easily \"Loverboy\". Plus this has the minor hit \"Mystery Lady\", and a decent cover of \"The Long And Winding Road\". That's over half the album, and the remaining four songs I'd call good filler. Any fan of 80's pop/soul should consider this a must own."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was on TV all the time to promote Carribean Queen as an 80s classic. I had never heard the song in its entirety, and it clocked in at just above 7 minutes long. Loverboy and Suddenly are also good songs, but not enough for me to rate it higher than a disappointment with the artist as a whole. This is another one of those Cds I found at Wal Mart for 5 bucks. I guess they're still trying to make their money back from the first press. Didn't even include credits, and no lyrics in the package."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "After recording several critically acclaimed albums for the GTO and Epic labels that did not exactly set the world on fire, Billy Ocean signed with Jive Records and hooked up with producer Keith Diamond who masterminded this classic 1984 release that made Billy Ocean a true superstar. The uptempo dance numbers &#34;Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)&#34;, &#34;Lover Boy&#34; and &#34;Mystery Lady&#34; all became huge hits but the title track was and is one of the most gorgeous ballads of its time and one which you can still regularly hear on adult contemporary stations throughout the country."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Like 1984's SUDDENLY and 1986's LOVE ZONE,this album,released in February 1988,spawned four hits. They are the title track,the love ballads THE COLOR OF LOVE and HERE'S TO YOU,and the powerful-sounding GET OUTTA MY DREAMS GET INTO MY CAR. The other songs are good. I like STAND AND DELIVER also. I never saw the 1988 film starring Lou Diamond Phillips so I don't know if that song appeared in the film. The other songs are great. Billy Ocean put out a dozen hits in the five-year period in which this album and the two predecessors were released. After this album,Ocean would start slowing down recording. Two more hits followed this album,LICENSE TO CHILL and I SLEEP BETTER(IN SOMEONE ELSE'S BED) which appeared new on the GREATEST HITS album,released in 1989."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I've only really heard three of Billy Ocean's albums, but this is probably not his best. Billy Ocean was one of my favorite singers back in the early '80's, so I may enjoy this album more than others. His popular ballad, \"The Colour Of Love\", is one of the better hits, but I think I like \"Here's To You\" better. \"Here's To You\" has better lyrics, more positive than \"The Colour Of Love\", and the rhythm sounded just a little more like a tender ballad. \"Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car\" was a song that was popular on the radio back then, but seems a little silly to listen to these days. As a whole, this album disappoints a bit, but isn't too bad. Perhaps with a couple more hits on this album, it would have been one worth keeping for the long run."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tear Down These Walls was Billy Ocean's final run at chart success.  The album features one of the most reviled songs from the 80's, \"Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car\".  It generally makes the list for worst songs from the 80's, but it is a little harsh as the song has a fun, innocent charm that seems to be missing from most songs these days.  It made its way to number one and it was the last time Mr. Ocean had a top ten single.  He became a casualty of the grunge movement in the early 90's as most 80's stars who were perceived to be soft met up with a similar chart demise."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of the best RandB singers with a soft touch I really did like his music he had so many good songs I really did like Billy I still hear his music on the radio now he sings so well that you understand every word that he says I would truly recommend anoyone who likes Rand B music to definitely buy this album because it contains a lot of good songs from Billy . It contains: Love Zone, Loverboy, When The Going Gets Tough The Tough Gets Going, Caribbean Queen, Suddenly, Sad Songs, and many other good songs so therefore this is a very nice album I really do enjoy this album!!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Billy Ocean. Good old Billy Ocean! Yepp, this is how real pop music is supposed to sound like.It seems all his golden oldies have been included on this greatest hits album: \"When the going gets tough\", \"Loverboy\", \"Get out of my dreams\" and \"Carribean Queen\". And yes, \"License to chill\" is there, too. Plus some ballads, but I find them boring.It's a pity that this is a CD rather than a DVD, since the videoclips of this singer are extremely entertaining. I mean, one of them features Danny De Vito. Another shows Jabba the Hutt (!). Or was that Danny in disguise? Billy Ocean has always been a visual experience, not just your average pop singer. But sure, the music without the clips works just as well.Well, what more can I say?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The best thing about getting old classics, is that they are inexpensive and still worth the listen. I may be 23 but I'm very old-school and when growing up all I'd listen to is Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, etc. But who I loved most of all was listening to Billy Ocean. Takes me back to my happier years and having fun. There are a few tracks that I don't remember but they are still good, takes me back to the Miami Vice theme wearing white pants era."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Billy Ocean was one the most pleasant and emblematic figures of the pop movement between the early seventies. His repertoire was composed by easy to listen ballads and swinging pieces that were influence by the rhythm & soul. He is visibly influenced by Marvin Gaye, Lou Rawls and a little bit of Barry White. He was owner of a natural sympathy and unique charisma that so many successful moments gave us along his career.This compilation confirms why he was the figure he was. Don't miss this important album, part of the musical history."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "So one day im over at Enrique's, a haunt me billy used to be regulars at way back when, and billy comes up to me and says &quot; I've got this killer new song in my head, but i'm not sure if its gonna sell.&quot; so I ask him why not. &quot; well you see its more of a nonlinear dramatic lydia lunch type of tune rather than my usual schtick.&quot; Well right then I asked him to lay it on me, and knowing big Billy I moved back a little because that cat spits like a mofo when he sings. so afterwards I told him &quot; look man its a great tune but change the words &quot;get out of my subconscience and into my libido to get out of my dreams and int my car.&quot; well I think everyone knows what happened from there. I just have to say kiler song BO,and i'll keep the stool warm for you, oh and I'll also save you a seat."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the one that put Buddy back on the blues map. With the help of several well-known friends, including Mark Knopfler, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton (who once called him the greatest live blues guitarist), and the great Memphis Horns, Buddy burns on the more uptempo tunes like the soulful groove of &quot;Where Is the Next One Coming From&quot; &amp; a definitive version of the classic &quot;Mustang Sally&quot;. Buddy's gritty, passionate vocals are intense without being totally over-the top, &amp; the background vocals are perfect. The slower tunes are not the old, tired, by-the-book standard slow blues, but are leisurely, rolling blues, focused as much on piano &amp; horns as on Buddy's guitar. He closes things out with &quot;Rememberin' Stevie&quot;, paying tribute to his own biggest fan."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I recently read a review on the 2005 &#34;Expanded Edition&#34; of this great classic blues album. And could not believe that they would edit out the great guitar work Jeff Beck did on &#34;Mustang Sally&#34; so I bought it and compared the two. And sure enough it's gone along with some other less significant guest work on other cuts. So if you want to hear how this album was intended to be heard, the one that  won blues album of the year, get the original 1991 version FANTASTIC !!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Buddy Guy is one of the top blues guitar man.The others are Jimi Hendrix,Gary Moore,SRV... In my opinion,this cd is his best work.You must put this at cdplayer,and hear as loud as you can,so you'll be in tune with  one of the most energetic,consistent,emotional blues sets ever recorded.  Buddy's vocal tunes are sensually incendiary,with the combination of right  music choices,resulting this great album,with explosive interpretation of  Mustang Sally,and passionate in all other tracks. I really recomend this  'Dam'n right...',one of my best favorites in my collection"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is, by far, Too Short's best album.  The whole thing is full of his unique, laid back flow and Yay Area beats.  IN THE TRUNK and I AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A DOG are the best songs, epitomizing Short's lifestyle.  IN  THE TRUNK has the funkiest beat, and the bass...you get submerged in it.  The production on the whole album is tight and Short Dog lays it all out  for the world to see:  the Oaktown lifestyle.  He's an Oakland Vet and  wants everybody to know it.  This is a no compromise album and one of the  best in my collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Too Short outdid himself on Shorty the Pimp, which is arguably his best effort behind Get In Where You Fit In. Its what you would expect from Short, boasting of having women and making/having a lot of money. But he does take a serious approach on here with \"I Want To Be Free\" and \"So You Want To Be a Gangster\". The best track IMO is the surprising \"No Love From Oakland\". Throughout, Shorty the Pimp is infused with plenty of P-Funk samples, but then again what can you expect from classic Too Short."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have been listening to rap for a long time and no one can compete with Too $hort.  His Oaktown style is like no other.  When I listen to this record I am brought back to a certain time period inn a place the only Too $hort can emulate.  Too $hort brings classic raps of pimpin, slangin dope, and riding old school rides down the street.  It is the representation of an era that canont be reprodiced, the early 90's.  \"No Love From Oakland\" stands out showing the real Oaktown funky Ant Banks beats.  \"Something to Ride To\" features the Dangerous Crew and is one of my favorite tracks, with 11+ minutes of staight Oakland Ant Banks funkn beat, it just lets me smoke and ride on the city steets all day. COP IT IF U A PLAYER."}

I thought that that was there first album. Hearing this album that came out 3 years earlier impressed me even more. They laid down the groundwork for Southern hip hop that was based on Blues, Soul, and G Funk. This was back in the early 90's when Southern hip hop and West Coast were basically talking to each other both being heavily influenced off each other. These guys along with 8 ball & MJG, Triple Six, Outkast, Goodie Mobb, and the Geto Boys are the only groups that can be called Dirty South Legends."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the first main stream cd that they dropped and today it's still one of the hardest. When I first heard 976 Bun B in 93 I was like this can't be real. I had never heard anyone flow like this cat before and his style has only gotten stronger. Bun B and Pimp C are the duo way before Outkast and all the other greats to follow. The thing is they just kept getting better with time. If you haven't heard this you are missing out. And the next up Ridin Dirty is a must have as well. I wish I could get the tape samle to this cd that they released. Tell Me Something Good had different words to it than what's on the cd and 976 Bun B had a different beat.

Spices flow was much more advanced from his first album which is a classic too. I can't sat how much I like this CD. I like what ant banks did with the 'george duke' sample on 'clip & tha trigga' too, since I used to like the original. This is essential if you want good westcoast rap.

On this particular album he displays his true lyricism such as metaphors,battle rap etc. This is definately far entertaining then previous releases such as sex and violence, edutainment, and ghetto music, those albums came off to preachy in my opinion and don't standout amongst his better efforts as I mentioned before. You can play the whole thing through, although in my opinion the only track I would skip is \"uh oh\" because it's a beatbox beat which get's annoying after awhile other then that this is a classic album in hip hop and a landmark in it's history."}

Bun B's rugged flow and menacing lyrics nicely offset Pimp C's playalistic style.  The beats are strictly playa beats that you can ride to or just chill and bob ya head to.  Never corny and always on point.  Pimp C is definitely an underated producer.  Every song bumps but the classics are `Return', It's Supposed To Bubble, I Left It Wet For You,  Feds In Town, and Front Back Side to Side.  This album, being nearly ten years old, does not have a dated sound and wouldn't sound out of wack on a mix cd of recent songs.  It would fit right in.  And that my friends is a sign of timeless classic music.  UGK - Supertight - 5 stars."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "As the album title, 12 Play, insist on sexual connotations, it is a lot more than just that. 12 Play is R. Kelly's first solo album, second overall. He makes a dedication to his mother on the sensational remake \"Sadie\". \"For You\" is a simple R&B love song of being a shoulder for someone. Robert also takes us to the earlier years of his life on \"Back To The Hood Of Things\" featuring additional flows of DeAndre Boykins & Carey Kelly. You can also hear him flow distinctly on \"Homie Lover Friend\". The weather never felt as hot as stated on \"Summer Bunnies\" out taking in some sunrays. Then as night falls upon the summer, he has something for the ladies to dance to as R. Kelly shows them how he'll \"Freak Dat Body\". As for the slow jams that invite the mood, all there's to say is good night!"}

As I've said in other reviews, R.Kelly's ballads are what make the CD work. Of course everyone knows the singles Your Body's Callin ,It Seems Like You're Ready, Bump & Grind, Sex Me Parts 1 & 2 but there was also the self titled track, the heart-felt cover of Sadie and the sentimental For You. The up-tempo stuff is really weak but the ballads are on-point."}

Though numerous legal woes have hampered his success over the past several years, he nonetheless got off to a really great start with his first album, which has a plethora of sexual undertones but still manages to sound more stylish than trashy. Contains the #1 hit \"Bump 'N Grind\" and the urban radio favorites \"Your Body's Callin'\" and \"It Seems Like You're Ready\". There is also a brilliant remix of \"Bump 'N Grind\" on the single for that song, entitled the \"Definition Of A Hotti Remix\". This was played a lot on my local radio station, and for those of you who haven't heard it, I strongly recommend. It is more blissful and sensual than the original in my opinion."}

I've been an Aaliyah fan since &quot;Back and Forth,&quot; and I'd heard some songs on this album, but not the whole thing, so this was really a treat for me. I liked the CD, and the beats, it really DID have &quot;a 90s swing.&quot; the only thing I didn't like was R. Kelly all over it. I've always disliked R. Kelly, and I think that the best ONLY thing he ever did was Aaliyah. The album, though, and the content was really immature, which wasn't rare for albums that came out in the 1994 period, but I still liked it. It was pretty good. But my favorite is still &quot;Back and Forth.&quot; :D"}

Still this Cd was very important in the mid 90's. Age Ain't Nothing But a Number, Back and Forth, and At your best (You are love) were her singles but I was also impressed by her other cuts.This Cd is straight 90's music but it is Aaliyah and it is still a classic!Favs: Street Thing, Im so into you, No one Knows.., Old School, along with her singles!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "On Aaliyah's debut, it ain't hard to tell that R. Kelly found her. Most of the songs sound like Aaliyah is featured on them instead of them being her own songs like &quot;Back and Forth&quot; and &quot;Old School&quot; (R. Kelly's name is even being mentioned in the latter's chorus). One of the only moments that you can feel Aaliyah's ability is on the remake of The Isley Brothers' &quot;At Your Best&quot;. This album is still good to play in your stereo, but if you want a really good Aaliyah album, check out One in a Million (yeah, I know she has another album after that; I meant what I said)."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "The Vallejo CA sound was started in my memory by The Click. They combine tales of slangin' rock with beats that sound like \"Cutie Pie\" or \"Computer Love\". It is straight West Coast but even Eastern rebels can groove to cuts like Bumble, Hillside, and Its All Bad. This is something different, because 40 has a way with the English language that has never been done before this. Hiphop is lacking innovators and E-40 is the definition of the word, Love him or Hate on him."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In a Major way is E-40's best album, a Bay Area classic. The Vallejo Boss Playa just blew up on this amazing album. Features the unmatchable beats by Mike Mosley &amp; Sam Bostic, Funk Daddy and Studio Ton. The album is  perfect from start to end and it's got the two classic cuts : Sprinkle Me  (feat. Suga T) and the one and only Dusted 'n' Disgusted, which has one of  the TIGHTEST beats I've ever heard, combined with BREATHTAKING verses by  the greatest rappers - SPICE 1, 2PAC, MAC MALL AND 40 WATER! The album also  features 40's long time partner B-Legit and also Mac Shawn, Levitti and  Celly Cel. This album takes the Sick Wid It Mob sound to a whole new level  and E-40 continues to develop his own unique style, inventing new slang and  always comming with fresh delivery."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "E-40 is at his best on this album.  He may rap about hustlin, sex, and violence like many of his peers, but the way he does it is inventive.  He created much of the slang we use today.  This album is laced with hard mobb beats (\"Dusted and Disgusted\"), melodic G-Funk laden with whiny keyboard riffs(\"Drank and Smoke\"), and even a track with a beat hinting of what we call today \"crunk\" (1 Luv).  He paired these neat beats with with his tongue twisting flow.  Most of the songs on the album are classics; the ones that aren't are still tight.

This second album has more great songs than their third Album &quot;money and muscle, and better performances, and more mature than Down and Dirty.  Definite satisfaction.Take the down and dirty album and add about million dollars worth of production value and you get this album.  The group probably won't make a fourth album so this is the one everyone will remember."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "For his second solo album, KRS-One worked with a variety of younger hip-hop talents, perhaps in an attempt to resuscitate his street credibility and his commercial standing. Featuring appearances by Das EFX, Mad Lion, Fat Joe, and Channel Live, KRS-One is loaded with fresh talent of the first-rank and they help spark the Teacher into giving an inspired performance. The album also showcases a bit fuller production than Return of the Boom Bap, but that doesn't mean he has sold it out -- it just means he's continuing to experiment, which is one of the reasons KRS-One remained a vital artist nearly a decade after his first record."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Celly Cel really does his thug thang on this album!  He throws in his complex, loud, and often fast flow over tight G-Funk beats.  A standout track is \"What U N----z Thought.\" The song is laced with some of the hardest beats and rhymes in gangsta rap.  A menacing foreground beat with a Dr Dre'ish whiny keyboard synth in the background.  He sounds really angry and crazy on that song.  \"It's Goin Down\" is a lot slower.  It has a nice slow jam beat with the occasional faint use of a talk box reciting: \"It's goin down\" during the hook.  Throughout the album, he shows the harder side of California life!"}

Now,there is a lot of controversy over if Backstreet or 'N  Sync(that other group) are better. I like both,but Backstreet Boys always  will be my favorites. They're the kings of ballads and have a couple great  up-beat songs(mostly on this one.) 'N Sync are the more hip-hoppy group if  you like that stuff. Their first CD was great and I thought the second that  everyone is fussing over is horrible. There's only about two good songs on  it.

As he begins by antagonizing others on \"Intro\" it continues over to \"Call My Name\" as he dares any competition to contest.  \"Dangerous Ground\" featuring 50 Grand is more upbeat than usual for Keith, but his ability to adapt nearly passes by.  The highlight of this LP is \"What A Feelin'\" with its groovy, scale runs with the bass.  \"Love L.O.D.\" featuring 50 Grand & Kel-Vicious is a good display of patience and the tight knit of L.O.D. as the trio shows why they are the nicest in this profession.

He shows his talent on here  we go with here we go. Also on this cd you can find rhymes by master p,  silkk the shocher, B-Legit, E-40, SNOPP DOGG and the flow of O'Dell. But  the song that is off the hook is STIL SMOKIN'. A Song which is he has  continued off his 1st cd. All i can say is that No Limit is in the spot  light with this man he is the most popular man on No Limit. Pick up the CD  and you will feel the flow of the Man they call Mystikal."}

Never got out from there.For me this is the best rap album EVER! and also 2pac's greatest work."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I personally like their newer stuff better because they christened their sound over time and Justin's voice got better but he has always been a political genius and it shows here as much as in any other album. The lyrics are incredible in almost every song but the best songs are You'd Do The Same, Die For The Government, Red White and Brainwashed, F*** Police Brutality and my personal favorite Punk By The Book. Also Drink Drank Punk is a funny one and She's My Little Go-go Dancer is a good song but the lyrics are kind of dumb. Most of the other songs are also good for a listen except for a few like Your Daddy Was A Rich Man Your Daddy's F***ing Dead which to me just get annoying. Overall this is a great PUNK album but I personally prefer albums such as Underground Network and The Terror State"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This band is truly terrible. First off, the music is terrible. It's soft and wimpy and lacks any musical credibility. I'm not just saying this because I hate punk. I don't see how anyone can like this. The singer (or singers) have no excuse to BE singing. Don't believe me? Check out &quot;Daddy Was a Rich Man&quot;. Or pretty much any of their songs. The lyrics are so ridiculous. I appreciate anti-political manifesto very much. The reason they are ridiculous is because they couldn't have made it more obvious that they don't know what they're talking about. All they do is whine. What's the matter, guys? Didn't mommy and daddy give you whatever you wanted? They wouldn't let you take the car out last night? What a joke! As is all punk rock with the exception of a select few who decide to rise above the punk cliche. You want angry music with actual TALENT? Listen to metal."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A very pleasant album, immaculately produced, perhaps a masterpiece of British folk. The songs are nice and pleasing, very pleasant to listen to: relaxing. Drake's delicate acoustic guitar work is fine and suits the songs perfectly, augmented by fine string and wind arrangements (though they can be slightly overbearing at times), and bright splashes of piano. Drake's own lyrics are beautiful examples of understated emotional poetry. His vocals are distinctive, very English, and a good medium for communicating this poetry, especially with this musical backing. It's a nice package. Certainly a hallmark recording for anyone interested in British folk."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "nick drakes debut album sounds like the starting point for a lost cult legend. even though it's nicks first album, he sounds as though he has been recording his entire life. it's a very sad album (although not as sad as pink moon, mind you), but includes many more instruments than later works. there isn't a bad number on this entire album. every song is a work of art. nicks lyrics(even though they're much more like poetry) sound as though they were written in the 17th century. they really are works of genius and beauty, and nick was without a doubt, one of the greatest poets of the 20th century."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "this is a truly incredible debut. almost every track is exceptional. cello song is really beautiful,time has told me is another classic featuring great steel guitar work from richard thompson. way to blue has some great orchestration that is not overdone. three hours includes some intricate guitar. fruit tree shows the  profound mystery, beauty and tragedy of drake's tunes.  saturday sun is one of the greatest things he ever did, it seems to me that few people regard this jazzy piece as one of his all time best but it is. the vibes, piano, drums, and bass on that song are terrific, not to mention drake's excellent voice. the man was  definitely one of the greatest of songwriters it is too bad this didn't sell well enough to bring him the acclaim he so richly deserved. try bryter later and pink moon as well,  for there are lots of classics in drake's short catalogue."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Bryter Layter is Nick Drake working with expanded orchestrations.Five Leaves Lefthas subtle string, but here, horns and even female singers  are added.This almost sounds likeForever Changes, except that Love album ratiated Authur Lee as mastero, calling the shots. Drake seems to be a lone guitar player surrounded by adoring musicians on Bryrer Layer. His singing is mournful and self-effacing as ever.Which makes the album so effective. The musical buffer around Drakes subtle voice only highlights his poetic modesty as a singer. The contrast of his insinuating singing and the big shell of the arrangements works wonders. Listen to \"One Of These Things First,\"or \"Chime of the city clock.\"\"Poor Boy\" is a bit much. When the singers sing \"poor boy, feels sorry for himself,\" towards Drake, it underminds the depths of his sadness. The whole piece is a little mellowdramatic and insulting to Drake, who was struggling with a serious mental illness.But even this song is a good spin, and the album as a whole is top notch."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's a shame but I'm just listen to Drake's work by now, at 29. Here in Brazil we don't have these releases and the imported ones are the only solution for this &quot;bossa-nova syndrome&quot;. This album has great and  happy songs. Yes, happy songs. Drake sounds happy singing At The Chimes of  City Clock and others. But the great charm here is the similarity with the  most beautiful album ever made, Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. Horns, flutes,  acoustic instruments and an haunting voice under service of wonderful  compositions. There's no cut here (and on the others Nick's albums) less  than perfect. Seems Nick had &quot;the formula for the perfect songs that  make souls more bryter&quot;. Since I've heard Pink Moon, Five Leaves Left  and Bryter Later life has become a little more bryter than before. Thanks,  Nick, wherever you are now."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "To actually access the music of Nick Drake, you have to get past a lot of baggage: the biographical legend; the twee aesthetic, aptly signified by the blandly psychedelic cover, fey title and spelling; the voice, an adolescent-whisper-falsetto type thing when it's not trying to be Bob Dylan.  Once you do get past all that, the album is a vaguely pleasant, if indistinguishable, wash of folk pop, with unexpected instruments - cello, piano, harpsichord, sax etc. - keeping things interesting (some of the songs sound like an earnest Divine Comedy).  There is one stand-out track, however, 'Poor Boy', part-Jobim samba, part-Legrand French cafe pop, part-Stones gospel.  Its pop melancholy suggests where Drake's true talents lay."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "the soft fingerpicked guitar at the beginning of introduction just gets you into this masterwork of an album. nick draakes second album is considered to be his masterpiece, and rightfully so. it is definetly his most up beat album, but thats to nick drakes standards. the album is full of beautiful poetry, nicks humble fingerpicked guitar playing, lush instrumentation, and even horns. northern sky, fly, and hazey jane 1 are probably 3 of the greatest songs ever written by anyone. if you are new to nick, this should be the second album you pick up, after pink moon. but all three of his albums should be in everyones colection"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the key Nick Drake album to get, with its excellent production values, and fully realized arrangements.  He's in great voice, and each song gets a sensitive treatment, whether its sonorous strings, or a bopping horn section, or a quiet bluesy piano.  The sax on At the Chime of a City Clock it is worth the price of admission.  Sad he couldn't hold it together enough to make more music--sad he died so young, but many in his era's British folk scene suffered, too.  This album is haunting AND optimistic--just listen to Hazy Jane II.  A classic which creates a mood from the first to the last track."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Nick Drake's &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; is an awesome CD, my favorite song on this CD is &quot;Fly&quot;.  I love this song it is soft, simple, light, and exceptionally mellow. It reminds me of water, because it is cool and crisp of extreme necessity. It drenches and washes the soul freeing and setting it free -- kind of like a fly.I find this CD to be the best that I have ever heard. I love groups like Bread, Ambrosia, and Fleetwood Mac. Mr. Drake definitely had his on sound and nobody . . . I do not think that anyone could ever produce such lovely music as he did. I wish that he could have produced more. Either way what he left behind was indeed a legacy.I am truly blessed by listening to such music that inspires the senses and the heart.  Mr. Drake's music is truly touching and soothing to the soul . . ."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is Nick Drake's most upbeat album, which isn't saying much, I realize.  He does combine elements of smooth jazz, horn lines and sax into his folk sentiments; it works well together.  While I wouldn't call it a happy album, it is nice, smooth and mellow.As always Drake's lyrics are built upon a series of images, mostly derived from nature.  Personally I find them the strongest element of his composition; but in this album the music is superb as well."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "i think this could be his best album- i think the best tracks on the first album might be better than the best ones here- but overall bryter layter is probably the better of the two. i defy anyone, and i mean anyone, in rock n' roll today to write something as perfect and as beautiful as, say, fly or at the chime of a city clock. drake's voice and guitar work, as well as the beautiful orchestrations of robert kirby and guest appearances by john cale and fairport convention members, among others make this a lush and truly incredible album, nearly every track is a classic. this timeless album is like all of drake's catalogue-essential. he just may be the best post dylan singer songwriter , and certainly until recently an underrated and unsung figure ."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Hearing Nick Drake for the first time was quite a revelation.  The guitar playing was so intriguing and...different.  And his voice really caught my attention.  This disc is awesome-I would say as perfect as an acoustic folk album can be.  &quot;Place to be&quot; and &quot;Which will&quot; are especially powerful.  No frills on this disc, just a man and a guitar.  There is an atmosphere of sadness that pervades this disc, it's great to put on when you have a lot on your mind.  It helps me slow down.  Essential."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Have you seen that Volkswagon commercial where those college looking co-eds look like their going on a road trip at night, and then lay on the roof of their car and look up at the stars. Well if you have, you probably did , or didn't now that Nick Drake's 'Pink Moon' was playing in the background. 'Pink Moon' was Drake's last album; originally forgotten by  mainstream music fans, is now a testament to what a true artist is.You could listen to this recording 1000 times in a row and not get tired of it, and probably hear something different everytime. The album itself is a melancholy, moody, sort of naive triumph.Although Drake's premature death of an overdose of antidepressants took down a genius in his prime, we still have his great recordings; such as 'Pink Moon', and just wonder, what if."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's impossible listen to Pink Moon without tears in the eyes. Drake's would be dead months later and music would be in the listeners minds forever. But the sound made by that 25 years-old englishman with his words  and single guitar remains stronger than poetry, than VW commercials (that I  didn't and I won't see here in Brazil), than all the simple things. This  disc is a statement of life and how big it can be, Drake is saying death is  possible. And only someone who knew the life can say it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Being a big fan of Iron & Wine, Sufjan, Joshua Radin, Elliott Smith, and Damien Rice, I thought I would try out this CD (also bought \"Five Leaves Left\"), as he seems to be an original...and I was impressed.  Nick's guitar work is very solid, his lyrics poignant, his voice mellow, and his songs strong.  The CD whips through quickly with its short songs (too short!), and I could definitely hear his influence in the modern day singers I mentioned above.  Although I prefer the modern singers, this CD definitely will work its way into my rotation.  I definitely recommend this album for those that enjoy this type of music...if you prefer Iron & Wine over Blackeyed Peas, or Sufjan over Timberlake, or Radin, Elliott, and Rice over Maroon 5, then you must buy this CD.  But do like I did...wait until Amazon puts it for sale under $10.00."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I, too was shocked and amazed (and a little saddened)to hear Nick's Pink Moon used to shill for automobiles, and I can't help but wonder what people will make of this if they buy it because of the TV ad...this could most  accurately be described as &quot;uneasy listening&quot;, on a par with Neil  Young's &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; and I would instead recommend  Bryter Layter for the uninitiated. However, this is my personal favorite  Drake LP, so yes, buy this one too, so you can discover what a very select  few have known for years...that Nick Drake was a major talent and the world  is a poorer place for his passing."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I was a latecomer into Nick Drake's music. As many other people, I re-discovered him \"thanks\" to the media hype of recent times. And boy am I happy I did! Nick Drake's music combines the best elements of folk and brit psychodelia.When I listen to Drake, besides entering a peaceful state where I feel in perfect communion with the rest of the universe, I remember music from Jeff Buckley, Elliott Smith (both, no longer among us as well), Rufus Wainwright and even Cat Stevens...Sad thing, how after thirty years of his passing, a commercial may bring his music back to life, some say. Me, I feel it's all just fine: Nick's posthumous album brings 1972 all back, with one mellow tune after another in 2004 or any other year you choose to play it, making it the perfect soundtrack to ride to and back from work, write to or quite simply... sit back and let go."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Apparently, a lot of modern young musicians have looked to Nick Drake for inspiration. That sense of despair, that sense of loneliness, irrelevance, that kind of thing... Maybe that's one reason why they walk around like tramps, loud-mouthed and stupid. The search for individuality has surely drifted into the hands of ignorant swine.By Pink Moon stage, Nick Drake had drifted into isolation and heavy depression. But the sound of Pink Moon is not crushingly depressing nor is it tediously claustrophobic.The album has an overall quality of sound. Some bits are higher tempo and, so, more uplifting. The instrument playing is precise, like Drake's voice, carrying the listener over desolate hills and stillwater beaches. I can't really pick out the highlights because it's like taking the chicks away from the mother hen.Pink Moon is worth more than a listen. It deserves to be thought of as a beautiful, melancholic, classic on anybody's list."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is just guitar and voice with a smattering of piano here and there. It contains classics like \"Radio\", \"Which Will\" and the well-known title track. \"Know\" is almost bluesy with its simple guitar and haunting voice, while the jangling guitar of \"Parasite\" has an almost hypnotic quality. \"Ride\" has a lovely pop melody and has been covered by other artists, I think. \"From The Morning\" is another pastoral gem. Although delectable in its minimalist elegance, Pink Moon is not my favourite Nick Drake album. I just enjoy his voice more with a fuller instrumental backing. Still, this remains a minimalist classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "yes, this is a sad and eerie record . i must admit that i prefer the first two nick drake albums, but this is a fine album in its own right. my favorite songs are things behind the sun and parasite. know is also excellent, a weird  little blues cut with ominous and powerful strumming by drake and  a few deceptively simple words. a majestic and rather creepy release from perhaps the greatest of the late 60's early 70s singer songwriters. and as always, his voice, arrangements and words are eerie,haunting ,and touching. highly recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Pink Moon, Nick Drake's final album before his unfortunate death, is a masterpiece. Recorded during midnight sessions on consecutive nights, Nick Drake sat in a studio with himself and producer Joe Boyd. The only thing that accompanies Drake's voice is the silent playing of his acoustic guitar (and piano on the title track, Pink Moon.) As Drake plunged deeper into depression, he expressed himself by recording the bleak Pink Moon, which stands today as one of the most underrated albums by one of the most underrated singer-songwirters in history. Recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "i had this review completely written when my power went out a few hours ago. and you know how frustrating it is to try to write something over by memory, so i won't. basically, i was disappointed by this album because i love self and was expecting their debut to sound really fresh and exciting and creative, but it's frankly not as good as their &quot;breakthrough&quot; album--if it can be called such--breakfast with girls. and of course, nothing tops their recorded-using-only-toy-instruments off-the-wall masterpiece gizmodgery, which everyone in the world should own (i recently sold my copy for 27 bucks at half.com...it's out of print, and i'm counting on it being rereleased relatively soon). anyway, subliminal plastic motives sounds like a fifth album, tired, uninspired, and while self had definitely already established the roots of their unique electropop sound, it wouldn't achieve ultimate fruition until the 2nd or 3rd album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is absolutely perfect.  Every song is great in every way; the songwriting, musicianship and attitude are all just right and compliment each other perfectly.  Elvis Costello may be dignified and old now, but anybody who's heard this album knows just how punk he was back in the day.  Just listen to the lyrics on \"Lipstick Vogue\" or \"No Action\"...you don't wanna mess with this guy.  Also, he's the only person who has EVER looked good in those glasses."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Though it was his second studio album, it contains so many classics that it could be called a greatest hits album.  &quot;Radio Radio,&quot; &quot;This Year's Girl,&quot; &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea&quot; were some of the top songs of the new wave.  They sound just as full of spit and vitriol today as they did almost a quarter century ago.  It was amazing to hear Elvis finally do &quot;Radio Radio&quot; on SNL, backed up by the Beastie Boys!  If you're wondering when Elvis was actually &quot;cruel,&quot; listen to this masterpiece!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If only for the great bonus live disc. I am sure they could have just released the concert on its own and sold it out many times over. Like another reviewer suggested, this is even more thrilling than the El Mocambo concert disc, but they could've fixed that also by releasing the entire Mocambo show, un-edited. Setlists being similar, we probably don't need both, but heck, Elvis could release them anyway. A whole passel of live show releases would be nice, for that matter...Docked one star only because the bonus material on the first disc has already been reissued."}

Seems like he was still writing great music but I wasn't connecting with it.So I'm catching up and re-listening to everything after WORLD OF WONDERS. And realize I'm not missing much. As always, his lyrics are exceptional but this is a dreary, monotone album where he &#34;speak sings&#34; pretty much throughout. &#34;Pacing the Cage&#34; is the &#34;old Bruce&#34; and a great, great song.The rest lacks hooks, melodies or refrains. Best to sit back and slip on the headphones and listen to his stories. You won't sing along but at least you're listening to an artist. Not at all at the top of his game though."}

But the lyrics and the music itself points to a hope beyond the darkness, although certainly one of Cockburn's intentions is, Brecht-like, to create enough angst in us to not forget that there is a world rife with....well, what shall we call it? Terror?  Sin?  Bad Guys?  beyond our speakers. Bruce is a superb musician and his voice is haunting.  A jewel among the Cockburn collection."}

While retaining the feistiness of his first two albums, Armed Forces showcases Costello's evolving prowess in crafting really good pop(ular) songs.  'Oliver's Army' and 'What's So Funny...?' shine here, but there are another half dozen or so excellent cuts.The Armed Forces bonus disc is likely the best in the Rhino reissue series.  Alternative versions of 'Busy Bodies', 'Accidents...' and 'Goon Squad' are interesting.

The extra tracks written at the same time are very good and are thankfully included here. Hats off to Rykodisc for treating this artist with the respect he deserves by reissuing these recordings properly. Other record labels should learn alot from them.[DW]"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This disk represented a radical change for Elvis Costello, as he and the Attractions moved from the bare raw sound of \"This Year's Model\" toward more layers and orchestration.  Elvis states that they were listening to ABBA on the bus, but do not hold that against them.  The cascading piano and layered keys on \"Accident's Will Happen\" and \"Oliver's Army\" still spit with bile of the angry young man.  Sparse arrangements, like \"Moods for Moderns\", \"Senior Servitude\", and \"Green Shirt\" are mixed in, giving the disk a complex series of shifting moods.  Nick Lowe's influence, as demonstrated by \"Two Little Hitlers\" (Nick had recorded a tune called \"Little Hitler\" about the same time) as well as Elvis' definitive cover of Nick Lowe's \"What So Funny (About Peace, Love and Understanding)\" shine throughout the release.  Listen to the complicated word play and lyrical mastery throughout the disk.  A must have!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "With Nick Lowe producing, Armed Forces turned out to be an album of very catchy tunes, which masks the acerbic tone of the lyrics.The arrangements are especially great on songs like Busy Bodies, Green Shirt and Big Boys. My favorite track is the lilting ballad Oliver's Army, but every single song has a unique pop appeal.Costello is amongst the most literate and versatile of rock musicians and especially on this album, the tight writing and clear melodies are prominent, whilst The Attractions must be the best band he ever recorded with.The new tracks include alternate versions and live recordings, demonstrating his magic as a performer. Armed Forces is a classic of late 1970s punk rock, but has always been accessible to pop fans and timeless in its melodious appeal."}

Good album cover too (the original vinyl album had square color post cards inside and a strange and annoying 4 fold opening system!).  Oliver's Army and Watching the detectives were hit singles from the album, but ever song on the album was good enough to be a single -- a rare feat."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "The true test of good Costello is ... do you find the songs running  through your head hours later?  With this album, I find one whole side  buzzing in my head - the second.  (In CD land where there is no sides, this  means songs 8 and up).  &quot;Pidgin English&quot; has one line that slides  so gracefully over one held synthsizer note that it's unforgettable.  You'll know what I mean when you come to it.  Keeping the songs short, yet  substantial, Costello works as if he were writing for 78's, and the sound  resembles that somewhat.  Lots of piano.  Yet not really nostalgic either.  I don't find the first side as compelling, and yet &quot;And In Every  Home&quot; is so charming that it almost redeems it.  Timneless All in all,  this is the one Costello album with an infinite Sell By date."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember reading an interview in 1982 where Elvis Costello expressed his desire to have someone like Frank Sinatra cover his tunes (as opposed to Linda Ronstadt). Out of that urge came IMPERIAL BEDROOM, and it shows wonderfully. Whether Elvis Costello was simply maturing or just displaying a side of his songwriting talent that he had to suppress for so long, I couldn't say. But IMPERIAL BEDROOM was certainly an ambitious and far-reaching album. &quot;Man Out of Time&quot;, &quot;Shabby Doll&quot; and &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; are incredibly brilliant compositions that, frankly, stunned me back in 1982. I couldn't get over the mix of sophistication and drama in these melodies. While I knew Costello was incredibly talented, I honestly didn't know he had such range.I don't think that Ol' Blue Eyes even bothered to listen to anything on this album--seriously doubt it. But for my money, just for the first few songs alone, this cd is worth every penny."}

This is a curious and unfortunate omission, so FYI to all who are considering replacing the Ryko's.

These two guys work their magic on this CD, and bring on a young bluesman named Robert Cray. These guys just seem to have fun with this CD, never trying to outdo each other. Great riffs in the leadoff track &quot;T-Bone Shuffle&quot;, harmonica on &quot;Bring Your Fine Self Home&quot;, lyrics in &quot;Black Cat Bone&quot; (hear Johnny Copeland yelling &quot;Hey Albert!&quot;) and the last track &quot;Blackjack&quot; where each does a tremendous guitar solo. Cray, of course, is now a major talent in his own right, and Johnny Copeland lives on in a way in his daughter Shemekia Copeland's music, but here is a playful, low-key yet powerful, piece of work from some of the masters of electric blues. Highly recommended for serious blues fans."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is my 2nd time out for Baez's second album.  I'm a big fan of the first album and of her contemporary Carolyn Hester but I'd forgotten that I traded this one in years ago.  The arrangements are dull and pedestrian and it's amazing how irritating Joan's voice can be when the material (or it just the arrangements) are so weak.I'm a folk fan, Dylan, Carolyn Hester, Peter, Paul and Mary, the Weavers, Journeymen, Roger McGuinn, Fairport, Kingston Trio, and Ian and Sylvia are special favorites.  So, it's not so easy for me to dislike a straight-ahead folk album like this one.  However, I found Joan Baez's 2nd album a very difficult listen the 2nd time out.It's back in the trade-in pile (for the 2nd time!)."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Listening to \"In Concert\" today, I am struck by Joan Baez's keen ability to interpret these beautiful folk songs.  She truly was in her element.  More than that \"achingly pure soprano,\" she was able to convey the drama, the pathos, and the sheer longing of the lyrics.  Just listening to her performance of \"Matty Groves,\" I can get so drawn in to the song that I can visualize the proceedings.  She was also a very accomplished and talented guitar player.  Joan Baez had a tremendous impact on American popular music and you can hear why in this recording."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a live concert recording, so be prepared for clapping and an enthusiastic reception by the concert crowds. It is quintessential early Joan Baez, simply strumming her guitar and singing folk songs that she loves. It was recorded at various concerts during her tours in August 1962 and October/November 1963.Her clear, sweet soprano is exquisite, and her choice of these thirteen  folk songs  should satisfy the most ardent purists. Truly, hers is the voice of an angel. For those of us who grew up with  the music of Joan Baez, this recording is a glorious trip down memory lane.The quality of this cd is what one may expect from such an early, live recording, as it suffers from an occasional lack of clarity and from a slight variance in volume from song to song.  Still, this is a cd that all devoted fans of Ms. Baez will want to include in their collection, if only for her wistful rendition of  \"What Have They Done To the Rain\"."}

Let me tell you that even though Paris's other releases aren't as strong as this, \"The Devil Made me Do It\" has flavor that most hip-hop has lost today, and that is dealing with racial tensions, political issues, and Black History (ex..Black Panthers) The beats are also mind blowing, and this album is very Hard for the time that it was released. Even though the album is somewhat dated, it still is a treasure, and I hope people that are infactuated with todays hip-hop could take a few steps back and pick up an album of such importance. This CD belongs in EVERYONES collection. Its that good! (i only gave if 4 stars because even though it is a classic, there are some poor filler tunes here) ENJOY"}

I like the song &quot;Ghetto Highlights&quot; almost as much as the title track.  &quot;Sumpin New(1,2,3,4)&quot; is a pretty catchy tune I used to hear at roller skate places a lot.  Those are my 3 favorite songs, but I also like the songs &quot;Kinda High, Kinda Drunk&quot; and &quot;Exercise Yo' Game&quot;.  The only reason I took off a star is because since this is an edited album, there are a couple of songs that could be good that are edited so much, it takes away from the songs."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "But sadly it's not enough to save the album.  Except for that one song the album fails on many levels (Even for rap music) with it's anoying lyrics, bad beats, and even bad rapping!

He proved he's got the skill to be one of the greatest rappers out there with &quot;Gangsta's Paradise,&quot; and in the &quot;Space Jam&quot; soundtrack he (With the help of other rappers) helped make the best rap song I've herd!  He just needs to use some of his talent and he could go far and shove cheap rappers like Eminem out of the way!"}

I'm sure the rest of the album is pretty decent, too. But &quot;Gangsta's Paradise&quot; will probably always be one of the best rap songs! If you love Coolio's music, than this is a really great CD and you must have it. Otherwise, if you only like &quot;Gangsta's Paradise&quot;, then I suggest buying the CD-single for it or the soundtrack for DANGEROUS MINDS. Totally awesome song. Probably Coolio's best.

{"label": 9, "raw": "The thing about Brand X, I mean besides it having caused me to take back all--well, most, anyway--of the nasty things I've said about Phil Collins over the years, is that their virtuosity as players is not just self-serving masturbation. These guys ARE virtuosos, but they use their skills to make really awesome music which serves the listener. I bought a few Brand X records (yes, records.... on vinyl), decades ago and the music is on my iPod today. If standing the test of time is one measure of good music, then this is good indeed.And, let's face it, for many like myself, this band turned the Phil Collins legacy from the lame, forgettable pop stuff he churned out like a placebo factory, to \"Holy crap; this guy is a seriously talented player\".\"Unorthodox Behaviour\" and \"Morrocan Roll\" are my favorites, though all of the Brand X releases are enjoyable."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This IS possibly the best Brand X album that features Phil Collins drumming on it. The whole album front to back is packed with some incredible jams and solos. Song in which stand-out on this album are &quot;Born Ugly&quot;, &quot;Euthanasia Waltz&quot;, and &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour&quot;. If you like Jazz, Rock or if you even like to Funk you'll definitely dig every inch of this. Another album to check out is entitled &quot;Marscape&quot; which is technically the first recordings of Brand X before they recorded under that name. The album is extremely hard to get a hold of in this country. If you ever come across it on vinyl it's definitely worth picking up. For me it's the start of the Brand X trip. It was recorded under John Lancaster and Robin Lumley but includes John Goodsall, Phil Collins and Morris Pert."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In the mid seventies jazz-fusion was at it's peak and there was no shortage of quality records being released. For me, one of the fusion bands that stood out was Brand X. Their music was captivating, all band members were tremendous talents, but most importantly, they had an original sound. Thirty years after it's release, this debut disc still is amazing and would be a great introduction to this band. John Goodsall shreds with the best of them but his soothing guitar work is just as striking. The chirping tones that Percy Jones creates on his fretless bass are unmistakable. Robin Lumley enhances it all by playing the perfect keyboard riff at the right time, and Phil Collins, on a break from Genesis, laid down some exciting drumming, maybe some of the best he has ever done. Enjoy."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First song, 20 minutes &quot;Crises&quot; is as good as &quot;Tubular bells&quot;.  The first 2 minutes are maybe a bit too new age but the rest is really uncredible especially the Watcher and the tower part.  The great Admam Ant is playing guitar on this song.Song &quot;In high places&quot; is sang by Jon Anderson (I just can't resist him).  I did not know it was Oldfield who did &quot;Shadow on the wall&quot;, a song that I liked a lot back in early 80's.  Well, it is on this album.  &quot;Taurus&quot; is a excellent  accoustic guitar piece.The 2 others songs are okay but I am not attracted to women's voice."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Mike Oldfield cautiously dips one foot into the early 80's synth-pop waters whilst still clinging to his prog-rock life raft in this interesting, if somewhat uneven offering. The inevitable 20 + minute opus is surrounded by some poppier, more conventionally structured songs. In fact, I'm sure there are millions of Hall & Oates fans blissfully unaware that the blue-eyed soul duo's top ten hit \"Family Man\" was penned by Mr. \"Tubular Bells\" himself! The title song bears more than a passing resemblance to M's seminal synthpop dance hit \"Pop Muzik\" (and may in turn have \"inspired\" 1984's \"One Night In Bangkok\".... Not a masterpiece, but a well-executed and mostly satisfying listen."}

Going on almost 27 years after they hashed this moster out in the studio, This Misfits album is one of the best of the late-70's, call it whatcha will, fearless, boundless, badass music. So pick it up, turn it up and grin real big as you stomp around your bedroom, spazzing out like you never would at a show, yelling, \"I got somethin to say-ay!

All the material recorded in just few takes.Here you'll hear original Attitude, that is covered by Guns 'n' Roses (Spaghetti Incident LP) and Last Caress (which was covered by Metallica). Glenn's singin' is amazing.Whole album is included on Box Set, with exception of two songs: Spinal Remains and beautiful In The Doorway."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No, it's just a young Glenn Danzig. The Misfits were the epitome of punk; insofar as they had no chops to speak of. To compensate for this; they simply turned their guitar's up as loud as they possibly could. As a  corollary to this; they come across here as sounding vaguely industrial,  or; somewhat akin to another east-coast punk outfit, Suicide. Interesting  and tenative sounding record, but; I'd rather be listening to a superior  punk recording by the likes of Fear or X."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Glen Danzig and his friends have simply made the best punk cd ever.  And it would be this cd.  I guess I'm not too much into the politics of punk, but this is a truely great cd.  With its cheesy B-Horror movie lyrics, traditional punk riffs, and 50's esque vocals, this band is, in general, just a fun band.  They are by far the #1 Halloween band ever.  They don't care what anyone really thinks, so they basically do whatever they please.  Some people may be offended by some of their lyrics or something, but oh well.  Glen Danzig should have never left this band, or they would be by far one of the most respected bands ever.  Wait, they already are!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you aren't familiar with the band they consist of a piano/lead singer (who's name is Ben Folds), a bass, and drums.  They have a very unique sound, and they all came out of heavy metal bands (weird, huh).  This album gives me the feeling that this is the real, raw Ben Folds.  Before the crazy success of &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot; due to the song &quot;Brick&quot;.  My favorites on this CD are &quot;Jackson Cannery&quot;, &quot;Alice Childress&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, and &quot;Boxing&quot;.  If you bought Whatever and Ever Amen I highly recomend you experience this side of Ben Folds Five, and if you are just looking for a great album with a fresh sound, this is it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Well, this is it kids, a trip back in time...before the &quot;Whatever &amp; Ever, Amen&quot; days, there was an album simply called &quot;Ben Folds Five&quot;. It was good. Very good. Too bad they wouldnt put &quot;emaline&quot; on it, because it is a terrific song, but despite that omission, it is *Still* a GOOD album. If you like Ben Folds's stuff, you should pick this up. Pick it up if you're not. Buy it. Enjoy it. Love it, it will love you back, i promise. OK, this reviews isn't so good, i know. Maybe its because I had all the songs downloaded before i bought it, and denied myself the glory of enjoying it as a whole, but regardless, It IS A GOOD ALBUM. Buy it, for me &amp; Ben."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have everything Ben has ever done since this album (with the 5, by himself, with the Bens, etc.).  This is still my favorite collection of Ben Folds tunes ever.  Of course I will always have a place in my heart for Whatever and Ever Amen (I listened to it literally 1000's of times after it was released!) but this is the disc I can go back to and listen to all the way through any time (Whatever and Ever has some definite slow sections).  This first eponymous CD is filled with great songs...every single one a \"keeper.\"  \"Jackson Cannery\", \"Philosophy,\" \"Boxing,\" \"Uncle Walter,\" \"Underground\"...great songs to drive around in your car and rock out to.  These guys were so good...I like Ben's solo work, of course, but the Ben Folds Five were the greatest."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The first CD put out by Ben Folds Five is the beginning of an era. True, it may not have the same sound as &quot;Whatever,&quot; but I assure it is still the masterwork of Ben Folds. As readings about the album shows, Ben mixes from the best, taking the styles of Gerscwinn, Jerry Lee Lewis, and even Little Richard. This is a fun album to listen to. Ben puts forth an amazing amount of feeling through his intriguing lyrics and style of play. Try it out, I am sure that you if you are a fan of the piano, you will be a fan of this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "An energetic raw introduction to this eccentric trio. An unusual combo of piano &amp; vocals (Ben Folds), bass and drums works surprisingly well, with Folds hammering-chords more than compensating for the lack of  guitar.Many pianists will be trying to play his cunning riffs... Put  this in the car and you'll soon be bashing the dashboard rather than  playing air-guitar at the traffic-lights. Whilst their later offerings have  been more polished (and with the exception of &quot;Whatever and Ever,  Amen&quot; less satisfying), none have been as frantically engaging and  down-right fun as this little stormer.A perfect summer record - crank it  up, open the windows and find new friends. Everyone seems to like this  stuff, but they don't know who it's by. Educate them!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was my introduction to Sinatra, thanks to the rave reviews it received from Downbeat critics and readers upon its release in the fifties.  It still holds up as Sinatra's best-balanced, most polished swing album,  the standard by which his later versions of the same songs can be compared.  This is not to say that the interpretations he gives here are the  definitive ones: some listeners may prefer later, looser versions of  &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; or &quot;Pennies from Heaven.&quot;  But  without this album it's pointless to judge the later versions--by  Sinatra or anyone else.  With this album Sinatra, more than any other male  vocalist, showed what distinguishes a jazz singer from a pop crooner."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A great disc by a great collection of musicians.  Cannonball often takes a side role-even as a leader-to the playing of others, specifically Miles Davis, yet the album has a warmth and atmosphere that are fully his.  'Autumn Leaves' is a stunner-beautiful and long with great solo work by all.  'Love for sale' is also very catchy-you will probably recognize the melody when you hear it.  I think the last track is supposed to be called 'Rangoon' but I'm not positive-it is 'Bangoon' on the back of the jewel case.  A great introduction to Adderley's work.  Highly Recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you like Kind Of Blue, you are in for a real treat here. Adderley, Miles and Blakey were and still are such big stars in the jazz world that their work is in a class of its own. The fact that they are collaborating here is an added bonus. Adderley's joyful sound and Miles's Emotional Charges Harmon Mute is absolutely exquisite on this album. Best cut would definately be Autumn Leaves, since Miles's work on this track almost brings a tear to my eyes because it is so beautiful."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have this in SACD, and the RVG Edition, and a new copy, this is for a gift for someone who hears this at my place and loves it, I can send them away with a great recording. I was very lucky to have an aunt who instilled in me a love for jazz at a very young age. She like Clifford Brown fell victim to autos, which could have been safer, for the speeds they could attain.My loss was a family loss, Clifford Brown was a loss to jazz and music in general. I was lucky and was exposed to so much music, I moved from the Philadelphia area to the East Village in the 60's to be closer to the music scene.I would not hesitate in suggesting this to anyone, it is a part of jazz history.There are recordings that no matter how many times you hear them they will fill you with something new. Music like this has an appeal that draws you out of yourself and into the artist's vision. Good listening"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Due to his contractual restraints with Columbia, Miles Davis was forced to record this album under the guise of it being a Cannonball Adderley project. This is then a Cannonball session in name only. Clearly this work follows along the same lines as Kind Of Blue, Miles's other masterwork also recorded in that bumper-crop year of 1958. Hank Jones employees the same light minimalist touch on piano as Bill Evans signature work on Kind Of Blue. And, Miles and Cannonball interweave extraordinary melodies on standards &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;, &quot;Love For Sale&quot; and &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot;. This great ensemble work, along with the incomprable recording and production skills of the inimitable Rudy Van Gelder make Somethin' Else one of the premiere post bop recordings of all time."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I genuinly agree with the 5 stars given to all the editions of this MARVELOUS albums (one of my favorite modern jazz albums I've heard so far)...I would just like to add that I agree with those who are of opinion that Miles, although officially the sideman on the Cannonball date, is actually the main star, with the glorious rhythm section contributing at least as much (if not more) than the official leader...Don't get me wrong, Cannonball is great, but it is the lyrical trumpet of Miles Davis that galvanizes and organizes the group (\"Autumn Leaves\"!), and even on the funkier performances of the album Miles is equal to the funky Cannonball, with the Joneses and Blakey working beautifully together...."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The British version of this CD is called \"Mr Fantasy\" - it has a superior CD sleeve to the US version, but a lot of it is in badly mixed mono and sounds very flat.

Both versions are great - whichever one you end up with, you're gonna love if you like psychedelic music!  Because this album is a psych CLASSIC!  I have both versions and I ALWAYS listen to the US version (\"Heaven is In Your Mind\") because it sounds better and makes more sense the way it is sequenced.

It has the original american track listing including two tracks that were dropped when they re-released it as \"Mr. Fantasy\" which is the english version (stereo much less defined). I highly recommend \"Heaven Is In Your Mind\" to anybody that grew up in the sixty's as I did, and remember the superb stereo on the original UA release."}

Dave Mason's \"Hole In My Shoe\" is a happier, chemically influenced tune, that shows a lighter side of his writing. In all, it is a period piece, that is different in that the melodies are catchy, and the musicanship great enough to stand the test of time."}

Some  call it prog rock - who knows why - indeed, it is true that there is more  to it than just plain 1980's rock. It has a touch, it has more soul. It is  bombastic rock without even being close to hardrock.

The result of this union was this unvbelievable debut album.  Penned by Wetton and Downes, this album produced the classics &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; and &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot;.  This album was released at the same time MTV hit the airwaves, so these songs received many hours of play.  This album still ranks as one of my personal favorites even after 20 years.  I can't get enough of Geoff Downes' keyboard work and especially Carl Palmer's unparalleled drumming.  Each track is first-rate and the insturmentals are perfectly blended.  This album is a must for serious rock music fans."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This first album by ASIA is astonishing. To speak the truth, I think it's their only worthwhile album. THe production (by Mike Stone) is clearly slick and commercial, but the songs are top-notch. Howe's guitar never sounded so fresh, alive and hard before. Carl Palmer is explendid, freed from EMERSON LAKE &amp; PALMER's tendency to overblown their songs. Wetton's voice is one of rock's best, and Downes' keyboards fit in completely. It's a shame it didn't last long and, for their second laubm, Asia tried even harder to go totally mainstream, sealing the destiny of the band, with the departure of Steve Howe (Howe still tried to get total mainstream attention with the horrrible GTR project)."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Old Asia was great, wasn't it?  I've had this album for several years now and it's still one of the best CD's in my collection.  To me all three of Asia's albums are gems.  Steve Howe's aggressive guitars combined with  Geoff Down's elegant and at times catchy keyboard playing, not to mention  the killer choruses, make this and all their albums come alive.  There are  no real highlights on this album because all the songs are GREAT!  To me  none of them stand out any more than the others.  The only song I don't  like quite as much as the rest of the tracks is &quot;One Step  Closer.&quot;  But even that song is no slouch.  Any fans out there of  progressive rock don't pass this one up!"}

Howe was already an accomplished guitarist with the progressive supergroup, Yes, while Carl Palmer brought his talents from the equally-successful progressive trio, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Downes was a keyboard player for Yes' Drama album from 1980, and Whetton was an accomplished vocalist elsewhere. They would fuse their talents and come up with some of the most memorable songs of the 80's, and of all time. Songs like HEAT OF THE MOMENT, SOLE SURVIVOR, and ONLY TIME WILL TELL are classics to this day.

Maybe they didn't have that much talent in the first place."}

It open with the beautifully nostalgic \"Chinese Cafe\" than launches right into the riff heavy sprawl of the title track. Touching on smooth & lovely jazz on numbers like \"Moon At The Window\" & \"Ladie's Man\" then switching back into rock & roll soul romps such as \"You Dream Flat Tires\" & \"You're So Square\". Other amazing moments include the melodic flipped-collar Vienna dreamscape of \"Underneath The Streetlight\" & the appropriately suave \"Be Cool\", & ending with the wonderful \"Love\" whichs rings true for everyone. She proclaims:\"Love suffers longLove is kind!Enduring all thingsLove has no evil in mindIf I had the gift of prophecyAnd all the knowledgeAnd the faith to move the mountainsEven if I understood all of the mysteriesIf I didn't have loveI'd be nothing.\"This is a wonderful expreimental album with fun & also introverted moments. It's well worth it! Highly recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The Eagles' drummer Don Henley released his second solo album,this one,in late 1984 after signing with Geffen Records. His solo debut,I CAN'T STAND STILL was released in 1982 on Asylum,the same label that the Eagles recorded on. Henley's fellow Eagle Glenn Frey was enjoying success as a solo artist as well. Eagles fans enjoyed Henley taking the lead on some of their hits like HOTEL CALIFORNIA,LIFE IN THE FAST LANE,THE LONG RUN,BEST OF MY LOVE and ONE OF THESE NIGHTS. On this hit album are the hits THE BOYS OF SUMMER,ALL SHE WANTS TO DO IS DANCE and SUNSET GRILL(Cher covered the latter). I also heard a cover of TBOS,but I don't remember the artist who covered it. Henley's next album,THE END OF THE INNOCENCE,released in 1989,was a much bigger hit."}

Musically, songs like the title track and \"Sunset Grill\" scream to you loud and clear exactly when they were made, but the album still hits home today.  With Walmart and various other corporations running the world, the lyrics of \"Sunset Grill\" are even more relevant today (and ironic, since the real location is now owned by a corporation!).  \"A Month of Sundays\" has got to be one of the most poignant songs I have EVER heard, and it could certainly apply to many industries besides farming.  \"The Boys of Summer\" still holds up as just about the best song from the 1980's, and \"Not Enough Love\" and \"You're Not Drinking Enough\" show us why Don just might be the best vocalist in all of popular music."}

Hong Kong Garden which burst onto the UK charts in 1978 still sounds unique and special after all these years while the other early hits have lost none of their icy appeal. I would have included some additional songs for a Best Of covering their early days, like &quot;Mother/Oh Mein Papa' from Join Hands and perhaps &quot;Jigsaw Feeling' from The Scream. In conclusion, Once Upon A Time is a window on the more &quot;elegant&quot; and certainly more intelligent side of UK punk rock."}

The opener of the album is Crying in the Rain, which had originally appeared on their 1982 album Saints and Sinners, Here I go Again was also a rerecording of a song that appeared on Saints and Sinners.

Whitesnake's turned out to be the more popular album, maybe the most popular album of the year because of it's commercial appeal, and the music videos that helped to sell it, but make no mistake it's a really good album. But Deep Purple's was even better in my opinion, a far less commercial rock album who's videos were unfortunately banned by MTV, which helped keep it out of the Billboard top 20.Finally, I'm so tired of reading about the Whitesnake songs from this album being Led Zeppelin rip offs. Coverdale has already confirmed that a lot of the riffs come from Deep Purple rehearsal tapes back in the mid seventies when Coverdale was their lead singer. These riffs are \"borrowed\" from Ritchie Blackmore, not Jimmy Page.

Every single song Whitesnake pretty much has ever writtien is a freaking ballad i mean sure one or two songs but the whole album? come on. Way too much synth and ballads too be called a metal album. It just doesent work Here i Go Again isnt even that good and Is THis Love is the worse song of all time. Dont buy horrible band horrible album would give zero starts. By far not the greatest album of all time in fact its one of the worse"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "There's some pretty cool material on this album from Whitesnake.  A total of nine tracks is included, and the album is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction.  The musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight and satisfying.  Most of the songs are straight-ahead hard rockers.  John Sykes does a great job with the guitar playing.  His guitar riffs and solos are really good, and he also helped write almost all of the album's material.  David Coverdale does a good job with the vocal duties.  There's also some nice keyboard playing throughout.  The songs that I like the most are &quot;Still of the Night,&quot; the ballad &quot;Is This Love,&quot; and &quot;Don't Turn Away.&quot;  All three are memorable and well-written songs.  The rest of the tunes are good, too.  This album is solid and worth a listen."}

Still Of The Night is one of my #1 favorite rock tracks of Whitesnake. You know Is This Love or Here I Go Again because it became huge hit worldwide.

While Modern Day Cowboy, Gettin' Better and Little Suzi got the most  airplay in the late 80's, the rockers EZ Come EZ Go, Cumin' Atcha Live, 2  Late 4 Love and Rock Me to the Top can melt your eardrums and your  speakers. The two lighter but very good tunes are Changes and Love Me. The  other songs on the album are also respectable.Jeff Keith has a good,  raspy vocal delivery that he practiced while driving cement mixers. It's  easy to identify Tesla's work by his singing. Great guitar work by Frank  Hannon is another of Tesla's signature trademarks. While the Great Radio  Controversy and The Best of Tesla are both albums worth acquiring, this is  by far their best effort."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A truly &quot;American&quot; album, very spiritual, ethereal, sort of like a thunder storm.  &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; has the dignity, insistence, and defiance of an unbroken man, &quot;Big Sky&quot; is one of the most dramatic songs I have ever heard; I have seen two hour movies with less emotion, drama, conviction, action, and passion than this song.Robertson's voice is a unique instrument.  I kind of like it, not only because it sounds unique, but because Robbie forces you to understand what he tells you, almost like a griot.Clearly one of the best debuts of the 1980's, and undeniable confirmation of Robbie Robertson's stature in music history."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Robbie Robertson's self-titled solo debut is also his best album on his own. Retaining some of the spirit of his work with the Band, he brings in numerous guests, including Peter Gabriel and U2, to help out, and the result is that his trademark style is brought into the modern age. Influences ranging from U2 to the Meters are clearly audible here, along with Van Morrison, the Band, and Bob Dylan. There's a cautionary undertone to many of the songs, which is fitting considering that his former bandmate, Richard Manuel, had committed suicide the year before. This is a CD that you should own if you're a fan of folk-rock in any form."}

There's a good balance of politically charged beauties (The Reoccurring Dream, The Beat Of Black Wings, Cool Water, Etc.) & also endearing odes of love (My Secret Place, Snakes & Ladders, Etc.) She continues her use of synthesisers (Also heard on 1985's \"Dog Eat Dog\") which constructs gorgeous pieces such as the bittersweet synth bouquet of \"Lakota\" or the achingly beautiful \"The Tea Leaf Prophecy\" in which she brilliantly says in wonderful Joni fashion:\"Newsreels rattle the Nazi dreadThe able-bodied have shipped awayMolly McGee gets her tea-leaves readYou'll be married in a month they say\"These leaves are crazy!Look at this town there's no men left!Just frail old boys and babiesTalking to teachers in the treble clef\"Absolutly wonderful record.

The opening duet with Peter Gabriel was pleasant enough, but by the time I heard \"Lakota\" chanted over and over, I realized this CD was both dated and discordant. As I tried to sit through a duet of Billy Idol and Ms. Mitchell, I wondered what twisted muse had inspired one of my favorite singer/songwriters on this less than stellar recording.There are some bright moments here and there, but Ms. Mitchell's better works do not, in my opinion, include this album. I see from reading some of the other reviews that I am apparently \"ignorant\" or worse, and I'm sure that I'll soon have as many negative votes as a porcupine has quills for daring to state a qualified assessment of an icon's work.Guess, I'm the skunk at the picnic on this one."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Edie Brickell and Company recorded one hit song \"What I Am\" which burst forth from the late 1980s college rock scene onto the pop charts and became inescapable on the radio.  It's also the tune that kicks off their debut album, the appropriately titled \"Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars,\" interesting now as an occasionally catchy period piece.  Brickell could be annoying as both a singer and a songwriter, but she followed up the hit with a few other decent tunes, including \"Little Miss S\" and \"Love Like We Do.\"  Elsewhere she comes off as an underage hippie relic who would have been more at home recording twenty years earlier.Overall, \"Rubberbands\" is interesting as a one hit rock period piece from the long gone college rock era."}

On SRATS, there are 12 consistent and  original songs with Edie's breathy vocals complimenting each one. The  music, lyrics and vocals are what make this a stand out cd. Sometimes the  first cd is the best from an artist and that would be accurate to say here.  It has the hits &quot;What I Am&quot; and &quot;Circle&quot; plus 8 other  tracks that are just as good.

{"label": 9, "raw": "THE END OF THE INNOCENCE was Don Henley's third solo album and his second since he signed with Geffen Records. His first solo album I CAN'T STAND STILL was released on Asylum in 1982,the same label that his band The Eagles recorded on. In 1984,Henley signed with Geffen and released BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST. Five years later,this album was released. Henley had two previous megahits with The Eagles,their albums HOTEL CALIFORNIA and THE LONG RUN. Now for the songs:the title track,which is the first hit from this album,features Bruce Hornsby playing the piano. The track was written or co-written by Hornsby. Other hits include THE LAST WORTHLESS EVENING,I WILL NOT GO QUIETLY,THE HEART OF THE MATTER and NEW YORK MINUTE. GIMME WHAT YOU GOT features Geffen Records labelmate Edie Brickell singing background(I want it,I want it). NEW YORK MINUTE also appeared on the Eagles' reunion concert album HELL FREEZES OVER,released in 1994. All the other tracks are good."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Easily one of the best albums of the eighties,'The End of the Innocence'still shines brilliantly.Henley has one of the most recognizable voices in business and on this record he took his great songwriting skills  to the limit;what makes this CD so great is not the star studded cast(Bruce  Hornsby,Axl Rose,Wayne Shorter,to name a few)but rather the exceptional  quality and maturity of the songs;they are utterly cinematic and  compelling,e.g.'New York Minute',as if each one encompasses a novel-they  also exude a certain timelesness making them sound fresh even today.Music  like this is hard to come by!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is surely Don Henley's best album, ripe with not only his trademark sarcastically, clever, and sometimes cynically honest lyrics; but with full-out music and arrangements. Beautiful, reflective songs such as the title track, If Dirt Were Dollars, and New York Minute are among his best. Also, rounding out the album, are heartfelt ballads like The Heart of the Matter and The Last Worthless Evening. The former is one of my favorite ballads, and the latter is noteworthy for it's clever lyrics. If you're looking for a Don Henley album, this wouldn't be a bad place to start."}

I remember the duet with Patti Smyth from Scandal (darn, it was only '89 and she was already a has been -lol_). Get this again if yer in da mood for nostagia, personally, i don't think i'd go as far as getting this album, there's some turd filler on here that sounds like the era it was recorded in, maybe download I Will Not Go Quietly and If Dirt Were Dollars, which were IMO, the best ones on there, and maybe dats just da nostalgia talkn."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Why do I say that?  It's because it encapsulates the decade better than any other did both musically and lyrically.  The 80s were, indeed, the end of the innocence for many, many of us.  In my case I got married, had kids, got divorced and changed careers at least 4 or 5 times.  The music fits every niche and cranny, from the metal edge of &quot;I will not go quietly&quot; to the satire of religion in &quot;Little Tin God&quot; and the failed materialism of &quot;Gimme what you got.&quot;  All summed up in the overture of the brilliant title cut and ending with the heartbreaking &quot;Heart of the matter.&quot;  To me there simply is no argument to make.  This is the best album of the 80s."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "There is always a day of reckoning. As the 1980's drew to a close, Don Henley's conscience cracked wide open, leaving no alternative but exorcizing the demons that dominiated from the mid-70's forward. This was the end of the innocence.The title track is an accomplishment in musicianship, but also a fine look at society's descent into shattered myths coupled with dreams destroyed. Great song for lying under a tree on a lazy summer day, wondering where it all went wrong.\" I Won't Go Quietly\" is a fabulous duet with none other than Axl Rose. It seriously rocks. \" If Dirt Were Dollars\" is so direct the metaphors get lost. \" The Heart of the Matter\", the closing track, finds Henley melancholy, accepting equal parts sorrow and blame. It's an open invitation to put self aside in order to return some dignity.A little philosphical, a lot melodic, this continues to stay fresh, almost twenty years later."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Don Henley has faced his fair share of personal troubles. Busted for &quot;entertaining&quot; underage prostitutes, smeared (along with the rest of the Eagles) by Rolling Stone on a regular basis and never quite taken  seriously as a songwriter by critics, The Age Of Innocence is timely  revenge.Easily as good as and less dated sounding than Building The  Perfect Beast, this album showed that Henley was both the most talented of  the Eagles and capable of a self reflection not previously seen in his  work.Sadly, those of us who are fans are going to have to wait for that  fourth solo album as the Eagles are getting back together to record another  album and tour once again proving that the public's infatuation with the  band is never ending."}

I estimate an increase in \"Gain or Loudness\" to be about 25%...even more improvement on quiet, pensive tracks such as Letter from Home or Vidalia. The balance is maintained and not overly compressed.The reappearance of the stand-up bass and the dynamic sweetening of Pedro Aznar's vocal stylings is what you'll notice right away. Turn up your subwoofer a little bit and enjoy Steve Rodby's masterful upright bass. The remaster also makes Pat's adventures to the higher guitar octaves more smooth and less screechy than the older pressings.Ear candy at it's best! Get It!"}

I still listened to everything Joni putout but this underappreciated collection of songs hit me just at a timein my life where I was reflecting about life and this musicfrom Joni really touched me. She's deeply spiritual, alwaysseeking answers yet always asking questions in her songs. I have listened to this over and over since its 1991 releaseand it still one of many Joni Mitchell classic favorites."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Here JM displays a new-found sense of balance and harmony in her life and music. Night Ride Home proves that the creative embers were glowing brightly again. Her languid voice is accorded poetic justice by the sparse backing on themes eternal. Religious symbolism surfaces on Passion Play and Slouching Towards Bethlehem - the latter an adaptation of a Yeats poem. The topic of growing old, gracefully treated in Nothing Can Be Done and Come In From The Cold, is brilliantly balanced by the teenage romance of Ray's Dad's Cadillac, in which Joni puts one over Rickie Lee Jones, one of her followers. Savour these lines: &quot;Ray's dad teaches maths/I'm a dunce, a decimal in his class/when it comes to mathematics/I get static in the attic.&quot; Well this is music - not maths - and Joni gets five out of five for composition and performance."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Night Ride Home was really a return for Joni Mitchell. She dropped almost all of the instruments that made her records released in the 80's sound so overproduced. There are more acoustic tracks who focus on Joni and her guitar. The lyrics are again from a very high level, like her albums from the 70's. Joni's voice has matured incredible and now you can hear that because of the sparse instrumentation. But that's not a complaint, because her voice sounds very cool and experienced by now. Absolute highlight of this album is Come In From The Cold, a song were Joni is looking back from the first time that she falls in love, to all the romance and relationships that have happened in her life. This is a great work from Joni Mitchell and if you love her more famous albums, you're gonna love this one also."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Lisa Loeb's first major album with her band Nine Stories, titled TAILS, is an excellent album on so many levels. It's one of those CD's you can listen to anytime, and it just speaks mountains to you, or it makes you want to sing along with it. Lisa's first single &quot;Stay&quot;, which was on the Reality Bites soundtrack, was the first song to go to #1 by an independant artist who had no record label. It's also on TAILS. &quot;Do You Sleep&quot; is another winner. The instruments are used well in this album. Composing and performing songs that combine effervescent pop with the lyricism of a skilled storyteller, Lisa Loeb is one of contemporary music's most sumptuous delights. The CD has not even one filler track. Other highlights include &quot;It's Over&quot;, &quot;Snow Day&quot;, &quot;Rose Colored Times&quot;, &quot;Waiting For Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Alone&quot; and the ever poignant &quot;Hurricane&quot;. Check this out for something new!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Ooh...Lisa Loeb's first album 'Tails' is by far her best album.  I love the style.  Great rock with her vocals just seems unreal.  I never thought I'd find someone like Lisa Loeb but I did.  At first, I didn't want to give her a chance because her single 'Stay' was overplayed at the time and I wasn't into that kind of music.  YEARS later I decided to give her another try.  I'm so glad I did.  The songs are relatively simple but hold a lot of meaning and most people can relate to the lyrics.  I love 'Do You Sleep', 'Taffy' and 'Snow Day'.  It's a great album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tails encapsulated the promise of Lisa Loeb, who made the big time with a hit single \"Stay\" off of the Reality Bites movie soundtrack.  The other hit off of the CD was \"Do You Sleep?\", but the other tracks off of the disc are well-written and executed, speaking of relationship perils of successes, sometimes with a sense of humour.  Lisa's star hasn't stayed as high since the release of this disc, but in part that's attributable to the change in the music landscape that occurred at the turn of the millennium, as MTV turned the pop culture sheep away from alternative rock and Lilith Fair music towards hip-hop, and (sadly) themselves away from playing videos and towards Punk'd.  Tails is definitely worth a listen, if you were a fan of music of that time."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In an effort to expand my collection of women's music I purchased this CD based solely on recommendations here. I have had no regrets! This CD is very good. It took several listens for me to get hooked but once that happened I have found myself reaching for this CD to play almost everyday. I was acquainted with two of the songs from the radio years ago: 'Stay' and 'Do You Sleep?' but others are just as good if not better. 'Snow Day' is high energy and I often play air guitar when nobody is watching. I will definately look into buying her other CD."}

They have a great sense of humor (as seen in their awesome Kung-Fu movie interludes), and GZA/Genius is a funny-yet-great rapper. He's not my favorite, but he's very very good (he seems friendly even though what he's talking about sometimes isn't). The beats here are fantastic, though I'm not sure who the producer actually was (I'm 50% sure it was GZA/Genius himself). The lyrics are always interesting and occasionally pretty funny - you'll definitely love listening to it all. Basically, if you're a rap fan or if you already like the Wu-Tang Clan then you're going to LOVE this album! Highly recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This my favorite Wu Tang album.  It ditches the ultra-intense everybody-on-the-mic atmosphere of \"Enter The Wu Tang\" since the focus is squarely on GZA (despite numberous guest appearances from all Wu Tang Clan members)and replaces it with a creepy, even more subterranean feel.  This is some of RZA's darkest and heaviest production.  It fits perfectly with GZA's grim voice.  GZA always sounds threatening and scary but unlike the hyped up Ghostface Killah or macho-sounding Raekwon, The Genius portrays this with a laidback, creepily calm flow.  And great lyrics that are both streetwise and surprisingly complex.  Whether he's describing criminal fantasies, autobiographical slices of street life, or simply destroying rival MCs with battle rhymes, GZA sounds both wise and scary, kinda like an aging kung fu master who could kill you with his pinkie finger."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd is so damn grimey like crazy. Every track has the most dark/grimiest beat you can think of. Wow and is GZA a genius?? He writes better lyrics than anyone else in the damn Wu-Tang and he could rip up any other fake rapper out there any day! This cd is tight as sh*t!!!!It also has a tight ass CD cover. He has more of a laid back style of rapping, and he raps perfectly with these beats. The track LABELS is a classic, so check that one out. This album is known as one of the best solo wu releases, and let me tell you it is!!! So cop this wu fans!!!!Peace!"}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Yeah, sure, ODB has the most personality, and Method Man gets all the ladies, but when it comes to raw MCing and keeping faithful to the true elements of hip-hop, the GZA is unparalleled. This is the best Wu-Tang solo  album, bar none. It has the darkest overtones, RZA's production is deeper  than it had ever previously been (and never will be again, as far as I'm  concerned), and GZA's lyrics just knocked me out of my chair. It was chock  full of metaphors galore, technicolor ghetto tales, and anyone who says  &quot;Labels&quot; was less than brilliant needs a speedknot upside the  head.

No matter what genre of music you enjoy, you can appreciate it. You will never find a group and artits liek Wu-Tang Clan and GZA. This CD just shows how much better music was back in the early 90's and mid 90's.

The one song I'd like to see here (which obviously couldn't be on it because it was written and released after this was made) is Taking You Home.  That's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  Other than that, there is Dirty Laundry, End Of The Innocence and New York Minute for us to enjoy.  I love this cd and I love Don Henly.  This is a must for any fan of his."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "When The Eagles broke up in the 1980's, two members landed outstanding solo projects. One of them was Don Henley. Actual Miles blends all three of his studio albums, into one great package. The songs feature his hits Sunset Grill, and The Heart Of The Matter. It also features three new tracks.The Garden Of Allah, is the so-called sequel to Hotel California. I thought it was even more frightening and enjoyable, than its prequel. You Don't Know Me At All brings classic rock and excitement in its depths of hard core Henley fanatics. Everybody Knows is a remake of a Lenord Cohen tune. This song was off the 1995 album Tower Of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen.While fans still look foward to his songs with The Eagles, Don Henley proved to break down the walls, and tell haunting and understanding stories of pop music in each of our lives. It is not the end of the innocence. It still is continuing on."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First off, let me say just how much I LOVE the lay-out art work on this CD release (hubba-hubba!). They used several full color adult pin-ups from (would have to be)the late '60's era. I must also admit that I may like this disc better than I do their 'Astro-Creep: 2000' mostly because it has a diverse sound on just about every tune. Totally dug the after dark mix of \"Electric Head Pt. 2\", the raw mix of \"Grease Paint And Monkey Brains\" and the ass-kicking wine, women and song mix of \"Blood, Milk And Sky\" the most. Great compilation CD."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Alright here's the deal, I bought this cd with an open mind.  I understand black sabbath switched lead singers and so did ac/dc and alot of other bands and they still put out great music with both frontmen.  Im not saying its not possible, it just didnt happen with the misfits.  i bet with sabbath and ac/dc other bands members helped with writing the music, but with the fits, glenn wrote ALL OF IT!  the lyrics and the music...he even taught some of the members how to play their instruments.  so guess what happens when glenn leaves?  uh-oh...now the band has to write music for itself and try and stand on its own two feet.  this stuff isnt terrible, there are a couple decent tracks on here, but its a totally different band with a totally different sound.  i hope glenn will forgive me for buying this...it sux."}

Graves' voice bears a stunning resemblance to that of Glenn Danzig's, but the band as a whole suffers without Danzig's writing and musical talents.  However, &quot;American Psycho&quot; is much better than it is given credit for by longtime fans.  The album is chock full of catchy hooks and B-grade horror movie lyrics, and the rhythm section of the band has grown and Graves' voice sounds fantastic.  Standout tracks include the title track, &quot;From Hell They Came&quot;, &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;, &quot;Hate the Living, Love the Dead&quot;, and the excellent &quot;Dig Up Her Bones&quot;.

Loeb has a beautiful and rich voice, her lyrics are poetic and haunting. From the song Falling in Love, \"The gray sky was romantic 'cause he was holding her hand, he was her man, the time between meeting and finally leaving is sometimes called falling in love.\" The title-track gives me the chills, the chorus is amazing. Truthfully is such a gentle and sweet song, so much better than I thought it was, \"You showed up with your parachute...\" If you like deep, meaningful, and poetry-like lyrics then Firecracker is for you."}

You will find Lisa experimenting with strings/orchestra arrangements which adds a certain quality to the CD that isn't found on the first album, \"TAILS.\" This CD was one that grew on me. The more you listen to the songs and hear all the production and work that went into each track, you appreciate it more and more! You realize why it was nominated for a Grammy for \"best engineered album - non classical\" or whatever they call the category! Be on the look out for Lisa Loeb's new, THIRD album, \"CAKE AND PIE\" ... In my opinion, it is one of her best CD's so far! \"EAT YOUR VEGETABLES NOW BECAUSE DESSERT IS ON ITS WAY!\""}

Carey was able to produce an album that could convey a space or futuristic rock theme without relying on pure cold synthesized gimmickry that was prevalent in the early 80's. It's awesome 80's early rock;pure and simple. On the whole this is one album that has been a favorite of mine all these years due to it's atmospheric and rich-hook laden lyrics and musicianship. Fans of Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, and even Enigma may be quite intrigued by this now 20 year old release with one of it's most captivating early MTV videos of Why Me ?..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember when Planet P Project first release the debut lp.  It was something that was really hard to label for sure.  Then I went and purchased the CD in the 90's.  The sound was OK and did not offer any additional bonus tracks.  This re-master with bonus tracks is just, as Dick Vitale would say, \"awesome baby.\"  While some of the songs have a slowed tempo you really have to appreciate how well crafted the tunes are.  Sadly, Planet P really did not do anything that came close to this release commercially or creatively.  This IS the CD to have with the bonus tracks and it being remastered shows the true strengths of this release."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Something brilliant. That's exactly what happens when you turn Cher into nothing short of a rock Goddess, and mix her with Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and Desmond Child. Aswell as these HOT producers, there's also production from Michael Bolton, Peter Asher and Jon Lind. This is honestly one of Cher's best ever albums. All of the tracks are brilliant, but my favourites are obviously the ones produced by Jon, Richie and Desmond!! (We All Sleep Alone, which is my favourite Cher song ever, Bang-Bang, Main Man, Give Our Love A Fightin' Chance, Perfection and Working Girl, though I really like I Found Someone, too!)

I really like the opening notes of \"We all sleep alone\".There's not a song on this album I dislike, Cher's powerful vocals sound great performing album-oriented rock material. I can hear and feel the emotions each song is supposed to convey. Diane Warren's songwriting and the production assistance from members of Bon Jovi were the perfect formula.I wish Cher had stayed with this type of material instead of trying to go into techno-disco."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Outrider was disappointing, and preceded the re-release of the Led Zep masters.  The story goes that Jimmy Page's master tapes for a double or triple album were stolen from his home - leading him to recompose this effort.  The basic idea of doing three styles - hard rock, instrumental and blues are here - and the blues numbers are the best.  But the guitar work is strangely bland.  As one reviewer puts it, this is an uneven work.  Plant's improvised &quot;The Only One&quot; doesn't do anything and John Miles - the vocalist - would do a far better job singing live on tour with Page.  The album also sounds too clean.  No grit whatsoever.  I rate this 2 and a half stars...."}

PRISON BLUES starts off with a wicked overdriven blues riff that just screams all the way through to the other side of your skull,man!  HUMMINGBIRD is light mix radio stuff. BLUES ANTHEM is probably the only song ever by Jimmy I dare call boring. After the FIRM (who were great!) and before COVERDALE.(also great!)

Then there's &#34;Blues Anthem,&#34; again with Farlow, to close out the album. These are the most obvious highlights, but there isn't a bad tune here. Highly underrated."}

Tunes here I found to my liking were \"Shaky City\", the catchy \"Lie, Beg, Borrow And Steal\", their unforgettable 'signature' song {if you care to call it that} \"A Million Miles Away\", \"My Life Ain't Easy\", \"I'll Get Lucky\" and the surf guitar-like closer \"Hobo\".

This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular, no wonder they had to change their sound after this album. Don't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it. The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning, great hook and chorus. This album is considered their masterpiece, but I've heard better."}

I thought that this CD would be a classic.  Somehow, it is not.The thing is that in addition to the five singles there are ten other tracks.  And many of them just do not do anything special for me.  I think the hooks are less memorable as on Rock Steady and The Beacon Street Collection.  Sixteen is an exception as its a fairly catchy new wave rock tune. Different People has a nice jazzy beat to it with good horn arrangements.  And the title track has some interesting textures to its style.Therefore I count the recording as about a fifty fifty split between good songs and nothing special ones.  Therefore three stars seems like the right rating."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Up until \"Tragic Kingdom\", Ska/Pop type music was unheard of in the mainstream.  After the release of the song \"Just a Girl\", all of that changed.  It opened the floodgates for a wide variety of bands with horns.Back around 1995, when this album was released was when I actually liked Gwen Stefani.  Her voice was excellent (has gone downhill since), and she just had an attractive energy about her.  She was the single reason why No Doubt surfaced on the scene.This album, Tragic Kingdom, was a masterpiece.  I can listen all the way through, without skipping a song.  Standout songs are, \"Just a Girl\", \"Spiderwebs\", \"Sunday Morning\", \"Don't Speak\", \"Happy Now\", and \"Different People\".A must have!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No Doubt beared platinum fruit with this delectable collection of charttoppers and sparkling So Cal/ska-meets-punk-meets-pop. This is an incredible album which showcases the amazing versatility of each member of the group and highlights Gwen's incredibly expressive and confessional songwriting. This album just gets you jumping up and down, and happy. With sing-a-longable songs and irrepresibly irrestible rhythms, how could you go wrong? They stay in your head and they make you happy. Perfect music for listening to on the freeway an hour before dusk. Ascension-like. Very recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of my favourite albums of all time. The themes are consistent through-out the entire album, and references to DisneyLand are hidden through out. This is one of those cds you should have on a top 200 basis, especially if you love 90's music. The singles on this album are superb, but even the non-single tracks are awesome. The title track is epic. Also good are Happy Now, End it On This and World Go Round. Classic Ska, Classic 90's, and just good stuff all around."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd, which richly deserved its diamond status, brought ska and No Doubt to the peak of popularity.  While the ska fever has died down, this album and band remain vital in the music scene.  This album is, for the most part, a happy affair.  Gwen Stefani is for this band what Christine McVie is for Fleetwood Mac, someone who can make bouncy songs even about depressing subjects.  Anyway, this album is fantastic.  The title track descends into a cacaphony of clashing instruments, and other tracks, such as &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; and &quot;The Climb&quot; are also spectacular.  If you don't own this album now, what are you waiting for?  Buy it, listen to it, and love it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I listened to this for the first time in a long time recently and was pleasantly surprised at how good it sounds.This is the ultimate No Doubt album - terrific sound of ska/new wave/pop.  Listening to this album again during our present penchant for 80's revival made me realize that \"Tragic Kingdom\" was about 10 years ahead of it's time.\"Spiderwebs\", \"Excuse Me Mr\", \"Just A Girl\", \"Sunday Morning\" and \"Don't Speak\" are all great singles.Hopefully this band will truly return to their great roots and return to this fine form in the near future...I think it's the perfect time!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd was the essence of the ska/punk genre, this cd definateley represents the best of the ska/punk mix as well.  Then to top it all off Tragic Kingdom is No Doubt's best release out of all of their albums.  From songs such as Don't Speak and Spiderwebs, Gwen shows off her amazingly strong voice, and does it very well.  From the punk riffs, to the bright ska sound from the horn players No Doubt made a huge impression on the world of music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No Doubt is probably the best alternative band out there, with second runners up by Garbage. My favorite tracks listed on TRAGIC KINGDOM are &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Just A Girl&quot;, and &quot;Don't Speak&quot;. I could actually really care less for the other songs on this CD, but I still enjoy No Doubt which was the reason why I gave this 4 stars. Anyway, if you love bands like Garbage than you should definitely get TRAGIC KINGDOM. Also get RETURN OF SATURN, which is No Doubt's new CD-release. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I just love Tragic Kingdom it has to be the best No Doubt album to date. It has four great singles Spiderweb, Just A Girl, Sunday Morning, and Don't Speak. This has to be the best album of the 90's and of '95 if you ask me. The whole album is a true rock album so don't think twice about getting this album because you might just miss out on a great thing. If you are looking for a great rock album it has to be No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom. Put this one in your collection today or you might miss out on a real true rock album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First of all I love this CD to death. My favorite track is Ya No number 10 because it shows her rock side of her but the whole album is my favorite there is not one bad track on this album and she explores with different sounds with this album compares to her others. She was just so funky with this album and you can tell how much hard work her and the band put into it. They had four number one singles from this album Amor Prohibido, Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, No Me Queda Mas and Fotos Y Recuerdos (Back In The Chain Gang). It was well produce and just a great album to listen to from start to finish so if you are getting into Selena this would be a good place to start to get to know what she did before her death because it shows you where she could of gone in the Latin Market."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This overrated album doesn`t do much for me. I don`t really see what`s so special about it, and I believe it`s the band`s worse record. The title song is a good opener, and &quot;Karmakoma&quot; is a great moment as well, but after the third track, &quot;Three&quot;, it all goes downhill and turns into an average and bland trip-hop/ downtempo record. The last song, a cover of &quot;Light my fire&quot;, is particularly weak and just puts me away.A disappointig and souless album, &quot;Protection&quot; is alright as background music, but not much else."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Massive Attack has paved the way for all trip-hoppers and electronica artists.  They masterfully out-do themselves on every album (with their best album therefore being Mezzanine) and with slow songs, gradual climaxes, and heavy beats, its irresistable to an electronica fan.  There is no question that the best song on the album they put first, the title track, Protection.  Its a sweet song, with tracey thorn's smooth vocals (I cant change the way you feel, but i can put my arms around you) with a great guitar riff and the classic massive attack beats, at more than 6 minutes long.  No downtempo collection is complete without at least one massive attack record- and the rest of the album is pretty good- but the whole album is worth it for just that one song."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought this CD after being exposed to Nicolette's amazing vocals on Plaid's amazing \"extork\". On \"Protection\" she sings \"Three\" and \"Sly\". These songs are fine (the music's a little snoozy) but her underground solo work is generally better.  The other tracks range from dull to downright irritating.  Sounding hodgepodged, there is no common style nor theme to this album.I even bought Massive Attack's \"No Protection\"remixes hoping for better luck as well as different takes of the Nicolette tracks (so I can cut and paste my own remixes on my MD player).  Well,  her voice isn't even ON that disc, and as a whole the music was even LESS memorable.Perhaps Massive Attack, though seemingly popular, just isn't for me.  Maybe they just aren't strange and distinctive enough to suit my tastes.  ..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of my favorite albums of all time!! Scarface first solo album with no guest appearances (how many mc's can say that??). If you think you know hardcore hip-hop and u don't own this album.....WHERE HAVE U BEEN!!!The beats are so dark and hard that it would bury the average \"gangsta rapper\" trying to flow over them. But put that boy Brad (Scarface) up to the task and he tames them. Every song (yes i mean every) is a must listen. There are no interludes or shout out trks on here to be found. This is not just mindless \"gangsta rap\" this is Harcore Hip-hop at its finest..Hotep!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "\"Operation Stackola\", the debut album from the Luniz is one of the hardest rap albums I own. At first, I bought the album for the song \"I Got 5 On It\" (which went all the way to #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1995.) Then I went further into the album. My three favorites are: \"Broke H*'s\", \"Playa Hata\", and \"900 Blame a N***a\". If you want to buy a tight rap album, and be slightly nostalgic at the same time, buy \"Operation Stackola\"!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "When I saw the band name Sneaker Pimps I thought to myself who would name their band this? I was listening to \"Six Underground\" the very 1st song I ever heard and I liked it so I listened to more of the music and I thought to myself not bad.  Kelli Dayton has a very soulful voice yet a bit to edgy, I am not saying shes bad but sometimes she sounds like a kid. Shes a good singer though. Chris Corner and Liam Howe wrote some very good songs.Chris Corner is a better singer then Kelli Dayton, I mean dont get me wrong shes great but Corner was a bit better, this is a alright album so I gave it a 3."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "love the pimps!  got this CD about two months ago, and it's rare when a day goes by that i don't listen to this gem of a recording.  the fifth track &lt;spin spin sugar&gt; was worth the price of the CD alone....the lead singer, dayton, has a sweet, cutting voice, (&quot;she must be a thelma or louise&quot;- track 6) and it perfectly compliments the dark, forboding trip-lounge/ hop music.  get this album if you dig portishead, massive attack, tricky even just a smidge...this CD is very intoxicating and you will soon find yourself addicted to the sounds of Becoming X.  grab this Sneaker Pimps debut...you will not be sorry."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Once I picked up &quot;Becoming X&quot;, I felt like I became one of the lucky people who knew this for more than just the great single &quot;6 Underground&quot;. If you liked that song, most of the others are as good. &quot;Low Place Like Home&quot; and &quot;Spin Spin Sugar&quot; I like just as much. My favorite though is &quot;Post-Modern Sleaze&quot;. It consists of this odd combination of acoustic guitar and trip-hop beats, but works really well. Sweet lyrics too. Then the next-to-last song &quot;How Do&quot; is nice and mezemorizing. Some people say this disc sounds dated, but isn't everything? I still play it often."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;Becoming x&quot; sounds today a bit dated,mostly because trip-hop genre was specified long ago.That is true,Sneaker pimps sound unique on &quot;Bloodsport&quot; and also on &quot;Splinter&quot; but their popular debut is not showing at all their skills.The fact is that Trip-hop was something original then and now Snekaer Pimp's on here are sounding like something between the band's like Garbage,Massive atack and Portishead.&quot;6 underground&quot;,&quot;Tesko suicide&quot;,&quot;Waterbaby&quot;,&quot;Spin spin sugar&quot; or &quot;Roll on&quot; are combinig electronic beats with some guitars and Kelli's sweet vocals (she is singing here instead of Chris Corner who plays here on guitars).but all these songs are just good.listen to it without any excitment.there are few gems here like &quot;Low place like home&quot;, &quot;Walking zero&quot; or amazing &quot;How do&quot; but all in all &quot;Becoming x&quot; is nothing more like another trip-hop album.I enjoyed their other albums a lot.this one is featuring some fine tracks but is not impressing at all."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I thought Sneaker Pimps really had something going when I first heard &quot;6 Underground&quot;, but then when I heard the rest of the CD, I was very glad that I didn't buy the CD and just heard someone else's copy of it.  The songs are nothing like &quot;6 Underground&quot; and are lacking in both originality and artistic talent.  Not a good buy.  If you bought the CD, then you probably find yourself skipping through the entire CD and listening to the last song which was a remix by another artist.  The original is almost terrifying.  The rest of the CD is just garbage."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am a big fan of most all types of techno. The Sneaker Pimps aren't the exception. With a hot lead singer who can sing with a band who make sounds basically, it makes me addicted at some points. The title track, Becoming X is my personal favorite because it reminds me of something Moby would make.On the other hand, Spin Spin Sugar sounds completely different on the CD from its version on the radio. It's much more longer and weirder. She cries at one part of the song. Then she starts laughing. 6 Underground is a perfect song which I still push repeat on. The remix(track 12) wasn't really needed because the only difference is adding the &quot;What's up witchu&quot; part in the background."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I'm not a huge electronica/dance/techno/what-have-you fan, but I do dabble.  If that's you, you might like this album.  The songs are reasonably catchy, and you may even find yourself humming them the next day  (I'm thinking &quot;Da Funk&quot;).  However, I found the album over-long  (I start losing interest around &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;) - fine for the  dancefloor, not so good for your living room.  Also, the  &quot;shout-out&quot; song, which is a quick (?) litany of people who are  &quot;in the house&quot;, is particularly annoying.  But for the most part,  it's quite listenable and fun."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "As a music fan and review, it is always healthy to bring yourself totally out of your element. I love rock prog blues and jazz. House is a genre I know next to nothing about.When I go to get my hair cut  and  stroll in to hear BOOM BOOM BOOM, I am not to crazy about the feeling. It feels to me music very young people dance, drink and have sex to. But when I heard this Daft Punk album was top of the line dance music, I got it.And like it. The beats are there, at  ranges a non-dance music fan is not used to. But hearing the synthesizer flourishes and the funky hooks here absolutely make this music to me. I am awed by the little needles of sound and rhythm shifts that pulsate through Daft Punk's music, which makes it to me an amazing musical experience.Probably this will not be a mainstay for me, but when I need a diversion, I know where to go."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The very first time I've listened to this album, I thought my player got broken or the CD was scratched, but then I listened again afterwards and noticed that it was actually the real sound of Daft Punk. No strings attached.After a few more times of listening and deep-diving it, I suddenly found myself hooked to the loops and beats of what could be considered the best Daft Punk album ever. A risky project which turned into quite a good electronic/house classic, as good for workout as it is for partying.Weird samples, extreme loops, mad beats and several other bizarre sounds made this album an essential if you're in it for electronic.\"Around the World\" is a true all-time gem, for sure.Strongly not recommended for \"Easy Listening\" or \"Adult Contemporary\" fans."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Perhaps to figure out how any listener would react to owning this album, it's important to gauge how and why you play most of your albums.  Homework is a breakthrough and a true original, bringing the DJ dancehall spirit into an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink experiment in sonic trailblazing.  Still, in the six years or so I've owned Homework, I've listened to it only a handful of times.  I think it lacks the essential qualities of the other great records of the techno explosion in the late 90's - the grand drama of DJ Shadow's Endtroducing..., the spunky accessibility of Chemical Brother's Dig Your Own Hole, or, to go a bit later, the go for broke propulsion of Basement Jaxx's Remedy.  If the originality of the music is enough for you, it certainly is here in spades, but it's hard to deny this record is distancing at best and forgettable at worst."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "To think that it is nearly 10 years since this was released is incredible. I remember being freaked out by the Da Funk video with the talking dog and the video for Around The World was a clever piece of videowork. But anyway, it's incredible to think that after nearly a decade in circulation, it has aged well.Despite, the previous two that I mentioned ( which have gone on to be dancefloor classics ), the rest of the album is just as good with particular mentions to Indo Silver Club and Alive. Alive in particular, sounds very claustrophobic. Really gets you going. Still worth it after all these years."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I decided recently to pull out my old vinyl of Paula Abdul and spin this baby.Well I have noticed since I am now about 11 years older I realized Abdul's voice now gets on my nerves, and that her songs though they had  their place and time in 1989 just don't hold up well today.Songs like  &quot;Straight Up&quot;, &quot;Knocked Out&quot;, and &quot;The Way That  You Love Me&quot;, just don't infect me like some old pop songs do like The  Emotions &quot;Best of My Love&quot; or Lovin' Spoonfuls &quot;Summer in  the City&quot;....get the picture?Unless your an Abdul fanatic, all I  can say is this is really run of the mill pop with some infectious  hooks...I think if Madonna, or Deborah Gibson (who have stronger voices)  sang these dittys they may hold up better."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was Roy Orbison's last album, which came out shortly after his death.  It went on to become his best selling album ever.  No doubt the publicity surrounding his death helped sales, but a lot of it had to do with \"You Got It\", which was Roy's last hit single.  \"You Got It\" is a great song, and there are several other fine songs here.  I especially like \"She's a Mystery to Me\" and \"The Comedians\".  This album makes a good final testament to the greatness of Roy Orbison.  Recommended to Roy's fans."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Roy was a west Texan,raised amidst the blowing sand,rattlesnakes,oil rigs,and women eager to break your heart. Like Buddy Holly, it all shines in the timeless music that he made. This CD is as close to perfect as it gets,as far as come-back albums. The production is absolutely great,and while I love all his older stuff,this is in a whole other league. Music by another Good Texan--buy a copy and put it with the SRV and Buddy Holly."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Mystery Girl is thirty-eight minutes and fifteen seconds and was released on February 7, 1989. Mystery Girl reached #5 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album and #17 on the U.S. Billboard Country Albums and has since gone Triple Platinum. This was Roy Orbison last studio album before his sudden death. The album contained the songs that made the charts and his last number one song as well. To me this is classic Roy Orbison singing.

{"label": 9, "raw": "A sad, sweeping swansong that easily rates among his greatest works. In fact, it is probably the strongest LP of his career as it is imbued with a coherence and a complexity that binds these shimmering pop songs together.  His voice soars. Years had done nothing to diminish his multi-octave  crooning... and the wisdom of middle age had added a certain poingancy to  each trembling note. These are songs about lost love and broken dreams...  beautifully arranged, breathtakingly sung. The production is a little slick  and compressed, but Roy's voice is captured perfectly. You can hear every  nuance of his phrasing. Sadly,this album is often overlooked. I beleive it  stands as one of a handful of great records from the last two decades...  this from some one who was supposed to be &quot;irrelevant&quot; by the  beginning of the '70's. Roy Orbison, we miss you."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A nice opening salvo in the Afro-Brit invasion; too bad that it never materialized as strongly as promised.  Still, this CD manages to hit all of the high notes while, for the most part, avoiding too many cliches along the way.  Some songs hold up much better than others over time - \"Back to Life\" and \"Fairplay\" are two good examples.  Some songs were good for the time, but now ound dated - \"Dance\" and \"Jazzie's groove;\"  others, like \"Feel Free\" are embarasments.  The rest of the disc is okay, but I have serious issues with whoever decided to put \"Dance\" and \"African Dance\" - two versions of the same song- back to back with each other."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "More Like 4.5 Stars. It is not a perfect record, but it is very unique and creative.  Key Lime Pie is slower than the albums before this one.  Dave Lowery writes witty and ironic lyrics which can make you think, laugh, or actually picture the scene for yourself.  The violin is absolutely soothing, even on the raunchy The Humid Press of Days. Borderline and I was born in a Laundromat are two best cuts. When I win the Lottery is down right hilarious.  This album will take time, so don't make your conclusion after the first or second listen. Let Key Lime Pie seep into your bloodstream and enjoy. Dave Lowery and CVB are genius! I will have the pleasure of purchasing New Roman Times when I get the chance.  Excellent!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's very easy to call this album \"boring\" in comparison to the rest of the band's catalog, but it's not to be written off. Gone is the experimental stuff, and for the most part so is the goofy sense of humor and eclecticism, but what's left is some well-written clever pop. Imagine a Cracker album but with some mideastern violins once in a while, and you've got the picture. It's a bit heavy on the slow songs, so when there's the rare one that's a little less than excellent things can start to drag, but most of them are beautiful, and songs like \"I Was Born In A Laundromat\" and their cover of Status Quo's \"Pictures Of Matchstick Men\" manage to punch things up at just the right places. While I'd reccomend Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart over this for a first purchase (it's as accessible, but done with a lot more creativity), it's still a very solid album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I got a chance to see Julia live in 1994, and the concert she gave still  ranks in my all time top 10 that I have been at. This is the CD that got me  started with Julia. I was familiar with Happy Ever After from the video,  but Porcelain is much better than her first release. I think that  Porcelain, Falling Forward and East-West are all pretty damn good and rate  5 stars each.  She got a lot more air play and video play 10 years ago. I  wonder why she fell out of favor with VH1?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Although vocalists Kym Mazelle, Victoria Wilson-James, Lamya, and Marcia Lewis perform well on their respective solos, the powerhouse performances of Caron Wheeler from the group's first album drops this recording down a few notches.With that in mind, the instrumental selections are clearly the better offerings here: \"Time (Untitled)\" and \"Courtney Blows\", are jazzy enough not to be pop and pop enough not to be jazz.That is Soul II Soul's contribution to the music industry: being something for everyone."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is actually one of the first CD's I ever owned so it holds a special place in my heart...That said, this has actually held up pretty well over the years. It's their second release; features a great combination of dance music, r&amp;b, and even a little jazz.  It's got a great vibe from start to finish; very solid throughout.  Very head-nod-friendly.Good stuff.  It's too bad this band basically fell off the face of the earth after this release."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I don't think Joe had made an album like this before its release and he definitely hasn't made one since like it. It is a somewhat popish album and not all of the songs are on the mark, but others are excellent, in both a musical and lyrical sense. &quot;Obvious Song&quot; may not be mindblowing, but it's typical Joe, as he vents about a few different social topics that he happened to have on his mind at the time. I absolutely love &quot;When Your Not Around&quot;, &quot;The Other Me&quot;, and &quot;The Old Songs&quot;. Most of the rest I would classify as good. In this case, the whole is certainly greater than the sum of its parts. Thus, a four stars rating."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "An underrated and very interesting record, &quot;Homebrew&quot; is a fine effort that wisely captures the musical zeitgeist of the early nineties. Creative and diverse, Neneh Cherry`s sophomore release combines pop, soul, rap, dance, spoken-word and, most importantly, is one of the first albums that presents some songs that origin the genre known as trip-hop. Although a bit uneven, this is still a landmark record that manages to be relevant today. Some of the hip-hop oriented tracks are a tad dated now, but the electronic and sophisticated ballads &quot;Move With Me&quot;, &quot;Peace in Mind&quot;, &quot;Somedays&quot; and &quot;Red Paint&quot; are as excellent as ever. An unnoticed gem worth discovering, &quot;Homebrew&quot; as much to recommend.Worthwile music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I think Neneh Cherry is underrated. Certainly underappreciated. Since  1989's &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot;, &quot;Kisses on the Wind&quot; and  &quot;Heart&quot;, Neneh Cherry has been mainly forgotten in America. I  think 1992's Homebrew is the best of her three cds. It has great songs like  &quot;Buddy X&quot;, &quot;Peace in Mind&quot;, &quot;Red Paint&quot;,  &quot;Move With Me&quot;, &quot;Trout&quot;, &quot;Ain't Gone Under  Yet&quot; and &quot;Money Love.&quot; This is a great hip-hop/r&amp;b cd  that was generally overlooked by the public. A must have for any rock  collector."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "...P>Lenny Kravitz has the amazing ability to take elements of 60s and 70s rock and make them sound completely modern.  There is no Jimi Hendrix imitation on \"Are You Gonna Go My Way.\"  Kravitz and his musicians have no aspirations of being Hendrix...they KNOW there's only one.  Some of the songs are driving and loud, others are soft and sweet, and Heaven Help is simply gorgeous.  I bought this album as soon as it came out in the spring of 1993 and it has traveled with me everywhere I've gone.  Whether I'm on a plane, train, long car journey, I can pop in this CD and know that I'll be entertained by an absolutely perfect rock album.  They are truly few and far between, and this one is a masterpiece."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Maybe not so much now, but when this album came out Lenny was the man! If \"5\" isn't his most popular album, this is. The title track and video was everywhere, rightly so. I like the first two albums a bit more, but this is still solid. \"Believe\" was another cool single, and I really think \"Heaven Help\" is a smooth song. No hits in the back of this album, but I still think it's almost as strong as the first half. I think the following album Circus was good too, but this was so huge it made Circus seem like it failed. Anyway, groovy album man."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Are You Gonna Go My Way firmly established Lenny Kravitz as a major rock star.  With the alt-rock scene at its peak in 1993, Mr. Kravitz's straight ahead rock sound stood out from the crowd.  Although he has been criticized for mimicking the sounds of artists like The Beatles, Sly Stone, Led Zeppelin and others, he plays his music with reverence towards his influences.  He takes those sounds and makes them his own.  The title track opens the album up and it is a cacophony of wicked guitar riffs, sledgehammer drums, pulsating bass and powerhouse vocals.  A truly great rock song.  &quot;Believe&quot; is an airy, mystical number while &quot;Black Girl&quot; is a funky come on.  &quot;Sugar&quot; is a stellar track as &quot;Just Be A Woman&quot;.  Are You Gonna Go My Way is a top notch effort."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's a shame 'cause Depeche Mode used to be such a great band - it was even THE band back in my gymnasium times.What a pity to release such a sleepy album. The instrumentation on 'Ultra' is pretty inventive but most of the songs do lack positivity and maybe even musical willingness. You simply get sleepy, 'cause they're all in the same far too slow atmosphere.Especially the hit single 'Barrel Of A Gun' is embarrassingly boring. Not worth the former Depeche Mode quality stamp.Only highlights are 'It's No Good' which COULD make it to a 'Best Of' compilation, and 'Freestate', especially its crispy guitar.Depeche Mode needs to work on this adjusted style. It can work. But it'll TAKE some work!A big compliment though for sending 'Ultra' out on vinyl too!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Ultra was their first post Wilder album and whilst it is not as good as Exciter it is the most inspired work that DM had created for quite some time. Songs like home, sister of night and bottom line all show what Fletcher, Gore and Gahan are capeable alone and without the dominering attitude of Alan Wilder. It was also the first time that they had employed outside artists to play on their records and the end result is quite amazing. They needed new blood and the idea to have outside artists come in and help with the recording is a stroke of genius. Dave Gahans vocals are not as good as on Exciter but they are much better then on SOFAD. This is an awesome synth pop album that should not be missed."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Seriously.  Just crank that puppy, and thrill to the way its glorious swooping bassline makes your subwoofer earn its living, and to the way it glides from DM's trademark minor key into major and back again, and to the way that it all just sounds so effortless.It clearly wasn't, of course.  These guys (now minus Alan Wilder) went through some well-publicized ugly times to get to the point that they were able to pull off _Ultra_ -- but they also managed to move beyond the stifling cynicism of _Songs of Faith and Devotion_ and come up with something catchy, cathartic, and occasionally quite moving.  I'd rank it right up there with _Violator_, _Black Celebration_, and (if I may plug a largely overlooked personal favorite) Mesh's _Who Watches Over Me?_ among the best albums ever released within its genre."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;Ultra&quot; is the difficult album that Depeche Mode made after the drug-addiction period that lead singer Dave Gahan went through and the absence of former band member Alan Wilder. Despite the changes that the band suffered, this is still a great return and a very worthwile record, focusing the group in an exciting creative moment.&quot;Ultra&quot; has a dark, contemplative, nocturne feel to it, presenting deep and complex songs that may take awhile to get into. Gahan`s vocals are better than ever, the electronic elements are contemporany without being too edgy and are not used in a way that makes them the dominant component of the songs. Most of the moments here are obscure and atmospheric ballads with powerful, creative songwriting and mature lyrics. The singles &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and &quot;Useless&quot; are three of the best pieces of the album, an example of the band`s strenght and genious. All in all, this is one of Depeche Mode`s best records, and that is saying a lot. Impressive and addictive."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "very overlooked album!Hardcore fans may not like it...they lost one of their band members and it sounds somewhat commercial at times and different than their past stuff...but I love it!  It still has a DM feel to it.Barrel of a Gun is perhaps the most experimental....you'll think &quot;wait..is this DM I'm listening to?&quot; Home is simply beautiful and breath taking...Its No Good is great and catchy...and from there, every track is fantastic...be sure and check out Freestate...another beauty...this may not be a sure fire classic like Violator....but its a great disc if your very familiar with the band."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Long before this album appeared in april 1997, I had the Depeche Mode fever. I felt something great was going to happen, especially after hearing Barrel of a Gun. When it finally came out, the album turned out to be even  better than expected. It still is getting better and better, after two  years. I love all the songs. Personal favourites are beside &quot;barrel of  a gun&quot; &quot;sister of night&quot; and &quot;the bottom line&quot;,  but my opinion changes all the time. One period I am convinced  &quot;Insight&quot;is the best track, the next I think it's &quot;It's no  good&quot; etc. Now I would say it's &quot;Sister of night&quot;. Black  celebration is my second favourite album. It's unbelievable that some peope  prefere older stuff like from the Speak and Spell and Broken Frame period  over this stuff. Those people haven't grown along with the band. This is  serious stuff."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a very nice blow session, recorded almost 9 months after the extremely popular Somethin' Else.  Unlike the earlier album, this one is definitely a Cannonball album in style.  Unlike many later albums, this is a blowing session rather than a studio appearance by a live, working band.I'll admit to being lukewarm on Milt Jackson and my judgment of this album is probably affected downward as a result.  Milt's playing is nice here, just not anything that sets me on edge.Like a lot of Cannonball albums from this period, there is a healthy mix of ballads (\"Serves Me Right\"), bebop (\"Groovin' High\"), interesting originals (\"Blues Oriental\" by Milt Jackson) and extremely funky material (\"Sounds for Sid\").  Not a spectacular achievement but a very good one.  Fans of Cannonball's 50s playing will find a lot to enjoy here."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "On a shopping spree, I bought this one, speak no evil and maiden voyage. Well, after listening to all three, this one just stay in my cd player. Some of the best music ever recorded in any kind of music. Beware: it was recorded by Mingus on a portable equipment. The sound quality is not for this age of 2000 bit digitally remastered. Sometimes the players are recorded at differnet volumes throughout the album. But dont let that prevent you from listening to this amazing, work of art. If No Parker, no Miles, no Coltrane, no Mingus, etc."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This recording is an essential addition to any serious Jazz collection, capturing as it does five Jazz giants recorded together for the one and only time.Charlie Parker is on Alto Sax, Dizzy Gillespie Trumpet, Bud Powell Piano, Charles Mingus bass and Max Roach on drums. From the first number \"Perdido\" you know this something special. A medium tempo version which never stops swinging. Gillespie in particular is in fiery form on this number. On \"Salt Peanuts\" Bud Powell plays a memorable solo, which precedes a thunderous drum solo from Max Roach.The atmosphere is fantastic with the crowd applauding the musicians solos, and sometimes you can hear the musicians cajoaling each other to better performances. Considering the recordings are over fifty years old the sound is pretty good. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because there is a newer 'complete' version of this recording.Sadly Max Roach the last surviving member of the this quintet has just died."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Man, this is one great CD. This and \"Straight No Chaser\" are my two favorite Monk titles, and Monk is my favorite jazz artist. It doesn't get much better than this for me - until I came across this SACD hybrid version. I love it! They obviously remastered the CD using DSD (instead of just grabbing the latested PCM remaster and sticking it on the disc along with the SACD layer) because this CD layer blows every other remaster of this title out of the water. It's 1957, this is one of the first stereo jazz recordings made, and they got it right."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Widely hailed as a masterpiece, but to me it's just another good Monk album. This does contain my favorite version of my favorite Monk song, an extended \"Well, You Needn't\" features numerous memorable solos: there's also a tender if slightly overlong \"Ruby My Dear\" and a swinging, fun \"Off Minor\"; there's also a painfully cheesy, thankfully brief \"Abide with Me\" (still, those are some unbearable 55 seconds), and rather unenlightening takes on \"Epistrophy\" (a remake of an old Blue Note single - the Blue Note take is far better, I can say that without any doubt whatsoever) and \"Crepscule with Nellie\" (which would later get several more touching readings on future Monk albums, most notably Criss Cross). So while it's a distinctive good time, and has a great cover, it's not as solid as several other Monk releases. Still pretty good, though."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This session always sounds as if it were about to fall apart at the seams, which is part of its incredible charm. While its underrehearsed quality makes a lot of the Prestige Records \"blowing sessions\" of this period sound almost studied by comparison, the resulting album captures the essential joy of Monk's music with a sponteneity lacking in some of his other studio recordings. Drummer Art Blakey proves a particularly explosive partner, really driving things along with intensity and spirit, and Coleman Hawkins clearly is having a blast, turning the still-developing John Coltrane into the tense schoolboy on this session. It's all utterly endearing, from the tune selection to the cover art, with the extended workout on \"Well You Needn't\" so much fun, it oughtta be illegal. If I were forced to choose the two most essential among Monk's many great recordings, it would be Big Band and Quartet in Concert, and this one."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Ok, this set has several of Monk's classsic compositions and is solid throughout. How could it not be with Monk , Coltrane, Blakey and Coleman Hawkins. I will say this..You WILL NEVER hear a better rendition of Ruby My Dear than the one rendered here. Hawkins playing is absolutely magnificent on that track. It would be worth the price of this cd just for that one cut. The bonus is that the rest of the cuts are extremely well played Monk Music so you can't miss with this one."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Taken from three distinct recording sessions - with bassist Percy Heath being the only consistent sideman - the album was released in 1954.Featuring musicians like Kenny Clarke (d), Art Blakey (d), Horace Silver (p) and Charles Mingus (p), the material is from May 19, 1953; March 15, 1954 and April 3, 1954. The eight tracks clock in at 30:05, with Miles Ahead and the title track edging away from the tight pack of quality music.The playing may not be fast and furious, but the sound is smooth as Miles is churning out cool grooves."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was the sixth of eight Prestige family of albums Nelson recorded (March 1961). As with all his work for the label, these are solid performances. The up-tempo STRAIGHT AHEAD might be the highlight of the CD, while the medium-slow blues (the only blues piece on the album) is also excellent. All the tunes are originals (typical for a Nelson recording session), and all are distinctive. The rhythm section [Richard Wyands (p) George Duvivier (b) Roy Haynes (d)] is solid and Dolphy is, well, Dolphy. (I liked him a tad better on the SCREAMIN' THE BLUES Prestige album with Nelson and a lot better on THE BLUES AND THE ABSTRACT TRUTH.) A very nice album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the second of the 4 albums issued by Prestige at the end of Davis's association with the label. Four of the six titles come from the 10/26/56 date and two from 5/11/56, same personnel: Miles (tp) Coltrane (ts) Red Garland (p) Paul Chambers (b) Philly Joe Jones (d).Sonny Rollins's OLEO, based on the I GOT RHYTHM changes, is a great tune; this version is not quite as good as the original one done back in 1954 when Rollins was with Davis, but it's taken faster and really burns. YOU'RE MY EVERYTHING is a slow ballad that goes to double time for Coltrane's solo - a beautiful performance.All four of these Prestige releases are consistently fine (all the titles were recorded in one take only). The epitome of hard bop in the mid-50's. Great stuff."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "During the mid-50s, Miles Davis out out a series ofQuintet which are worth gold today. I have 'em all & this one is my fav. You had Miles with his muted trumpet, Trane on tenor, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers-bass & the great Philly Joe Jones on drums. If you are judged by the company you keep, Miles had a gold mine here.This is \"the quinteswsential groups output from one day's marathon recording session.\" It shows the outstanding talents of Trane who was just emerging as a great tenor man.I won't discuss the name of the tunes. It's not the tune you play in the world of jazz, but what the guys do with it that matters.Thank you for reading my review, & I hope you will get this album & the other \"Miles' Quintet\" gigs, like \"Workiin', etc."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "THis Disc is Rich in Sound&amp;Quality.Miles Plays with Such Passion&amp;Energy.His Band is Very Top Notch as well.Strong Chemistry makes for Classic Music.this is in a Long,Long,Long, Line Of Great Albums  From this Genius.Not Only Was He Banging on His Instrument but His Genius  at getting the Right Players is Amazing as well.Nobody Before or Since has  had as Many Great Players Alongside as Miles.Maybe Duke Ellington&amp;James  Brown but Overall You Gotta Give Miles The Edge at Having the Best Talent  Around.He is The MAN!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "right from the opening tones of &quot;if i were a bell,&quot; miles and  company (the classic quintet with john coltrane, red garland, paul  chambers, and philly joe jones) set the tone for a quietly swinging set of  cool jazz. miles continued to explore his own version of cool jazz (much  more bop oriented than west coast jazz), but here the sound is becoming  even more uncategorizable, more distinctly miles' own voice and timbre. he  explores melody and themes finding his own phrasing and expansions, leaving  plenty of room for the song to develop as it will. in sum, he uses silence  as part of the form, like ahmad jamal, for instance, creating tension and  setting fires within the tune. the band is stellar and one can hear  coltrane getting his own voice, as well, laying the foundations for what  was to come in a few years. well worth any price!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The 1954 album Bags Groove by Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants, who feature Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins, among others, is one of the best albums of the Miles Davis' early career. The band is incredible, with some of the top musicians of the time and of all time. The songs Doxy and But Not For Me are the least impressive songs on the album and aren't very strong, which slightly hurts the album, but not too much. The title track is great with some inspired trumpet playing by Miles. The two Sonny Rollins tunes, Airegin and Oleo are the highlights of the album. Both are really great songs that would become standards for both Sonny Rollins and Miles Davis. True, this is not the best album by Miles Davis, and maybee not even one of the best. It is still great, however, and is worth it just to hear Miles and Sonny soloing being backed by Monk."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I just received this remastered classic from Amazon and it is ASTOUNDING ! I can't believe it took me so long to pick this up. Miles sounds as good as I've ever heard him and the rest of the musicians are also at their best particularly Milt Jackson on the title track.  Monk sounds a bit tentative and the story is that Miles asked him to sit out while he took his solo but Monk came through when it was his time to comp behind Jackson's solo and take his own solo. He sounds inventive and unmistakably Monk. Horace Silver and Sonny Rollins both sound wonderful and the tracks where they are featured really swing. The heart of this fine CD is the incredible rhythm section of Percy Heath and Keny Clarke. These guys were rock solid throughout this session and with the remastering Heath's bass lines just jump through the speakers.Do not hesitate to purchase this. You will be glad you did."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Does Wes Montgomery live up to the boastful title?  That's the main question any review should answer.  YES.  Wes' playing is generally similar to his other jazz-era (vs pop-era) songs.  He's jaw-dropping on the faster songs.  Wes is good on the slower songs, though he tends to be too nice.  \"The Incredible Jazz Guitar\" is a better album, but \"Boss Guitar\" should be in every fan's collection.  The trio format works out fine.  There's a good reason Grant Green made so many albums with organ - it's very compatible with guitar.  Mel Rhyne gets to take the first solo in \"Dearly Beloved\" and in general provides solid playing.  Jimmy Cobb is, as usual, fantastic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have had this album in my (more or less) Complete Works of Stan Getz for more than a decade but it hadn't occupied a postion of prominence. But I went back the other day and relistened and I really like it!There are less of Getz wonderful ballads than one often finds in this period but the music is spirited and happy and Getz does a great job of call-and-response to passages Tjader plays first on vibes, for example \"Ginza Samba\". Sounds bounce back and forth from vibes to sax and back again! What a happy, optimistic period this was in music.Fun and high energy from beginning to end. Melodic, relaxed and swinging! Should be more popular. Quite fifties Latin music - Seems to presage Getz Bossa Nova albums, in a vague sense.Well recorded, for it's period.(NOt that it's anyone's business, but I bought this CD before Amazon existed)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This CD is a treat from start to finish. I like the mix of well known and not so well known songs, and I especially like Moritat (\"Mack the Knife\") for its straight forward delivery, true to the original rhythm and swing, and a saxophone solo by Sonny that is unparalleled in recorded jazz history. I've never had any issues with Van Gelder re-mixes, and I can confirm that there are a few blips here and there, but I don't consider them distracting and the music can still be easily enjoyed. Fans of sax jazz simply must buy this recording, and I don't see how any serious fan of jazz can be without it. If you are looking for something to broaden a non-jazz oriented music collection, I think this might be a good candidate for you, simply because the music is so much fun. Let 'er rip!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Without a doubt, one of the five best jazz albums ever made is this 1956 masterpiece. Recorded in a single day at Rudy Van Gelder's living room/studio, Sonny Rollins earned his place as a legend with &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot;. Aided and abetted by powerhouse drummer Max Roach, pianist Tommy Flanagan, and bassist Doug Watkins, the quartet plays with the precision of a chamber orchestra, and swings just as hard. It's not very often that you hear an album where the musicians are so in tune with each other. From the breezy sway of &quot;St. Thomas&quot; to the final notes of &quot;Blue 7&quot;, Rollins and company shows how it should be done. This newly remastered edition finally sounds as great as the original vinyl pressing but without the hefty price you'll shuck out for an original copy. No serious jazz fan should be without a copy of this amazing album in their collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny Rollins was at the time of this recording one of the greatest and most innovative tenorists. Today his stature is possibly somewhat overshadowed by that of John Coltrane, as Coltrane's individualism and innovative powers are very obvious. In his own way, though, Rollins also made a very important contribution as an innovator - perhaps especially in his handling of rhythm. In any case, he was certainly one of the most satisfying tenor players of his time, with a hard drive on up-tempo tracks, and melodious (never sentimental) lyricism on slower numbers. His phrasing was always interesting, articulate, and musical. This is an excellent record which shows him to great advantage, e.g. in \"St Thomas\" and \"Moritat\", though I personally think he is even more exciting when heading the trio on \" A Night at the Village Vanguard\", as, in truth, no pianist could really match him satisfactorily as a soloist, and he does not need a piano as an accompaniment. - Joost Daalder"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny Rollins , considered by many to be the quintessential live performer, admittedly felt restricted in a studio. However listening to his masterpiece Saxophone Colossus it is clear that he was on this occasion  able to capture some of the energy of a live performance on vinyl. The record is a tour-du-force of Rollins musical vision and mastery of improvisational inventiveness within a melodic and harmonic form that draws the listener in chorus after chorus.Max Roach's drumming drives every track particularly the classic St Thomas. Roach and Rollins trade 4's on Blue 7 and play off of each other beautifully throughout. Tommy Flanagan's piano playing is subtle and perfectly suited to this group.This is my favorite Rollins recording other than those made with Clifford Brown and Max Roach's group."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I'll weigh in on the Rollins vs. Coltrane issue.  When I first discovered jazz 30 years ago I fell under the Coltrane spell.  I couldn't get enough of him, wore out two copies of Live at the Village Vanguard.  As I got older I began to prefer the clarity of ideas, mastery of rhythm and melodic storytelling of the great Sonny Rollins.  Now there is no contest.  I agree with those who believe that Sonny is the greatest improviser of the last 50 years, or more.  Every cut on Saxophone Colossus is a jewel.  Blue 7 was famously analyzed by musicologist Gunther Schuller as a model of almost architectural structure in improvised music.  I prefer to think of it as melodic storytelling.  Nobody does it better than Sonny Rollins.  This record is one of the finest in jazz, in 1956, now or 100 years from now."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny Rollins' \"Saxophone Colossus\" is one of those albums that you could listen to 20 times in a row and never tire of because it's just that good. I've owned this recording for a couple of years and I still return to it from time to time. Rollins' warm, round tone makes this album the masterpiece it is, but that's not to discount his group for this session: Tommy Flanagan on piano, Doug Watkins on bass, and Max Roach on drums, who provide excellent support. This is a classic for reason. Want to find out why? Pick this up today. An essential jazz recording."}

But there are no &#34;Bla Bla's or nonsense syllables here just Chets soft voice singing as if he was playing trumpet  ."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Although not as strong and flowing as the superb \"Saxophone Colussus\" this record still contains some very good tracks. In particular I liked the swinging songs of \"I'm an Old Cowhand\", \"Wagon Wheels\" amd \"Way Out West\" which showcase some great solos from Sonny Rollins.Bassist Ray Brown and Drummer Shelly Manne make worthy contributions with some excellent solos of their own in the rhythm section but feel a little dissapointed with the absence of piano or guitar. When listening to all the songs it sometimes feels in my opinion as if there is something missing eventhough Sonny's playing is mostly wonderful."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Don't be fooled by the number of tracks (four) - you definitely get your money's worth on this one.  Isaac Hayes really showcases his ability to rework standards by composers like Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb.  You would never believe these weren't written to be mellow grooving soul.  From the cynical, ironic, Gen-X perspective, the intro to &quot;Phoenix&quot; seems a little too long and silly, but by the last few minutes of the song, you finally see where he was going with it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Some excellent reviews of this album that cover all you need to know about the music ... so all I can do is agree! Truly, as others have noted, this was a daring, revolutionary album when it was released. Innovative production and puutting out songs that took up the whole side of an album? Insane ... and brilliant. This was a true immersion in soul magic, hot buttered, funky, and silky smooth. My only knock against this \"Anniversary\" edition is the fact that the \"Bonus\" tracks are simply two single edits of tracks already on the album. Come on, record company weasels, give us something truly special or rare! If you make us buy an album/CD we already own, at least justify another purchase with something really extra. That gripe aside, this remains a wonderful listening experience."}

Still, this recording would shine in 5.1 surround, so come on MoFi, give us a 5.1 presentation.  Sure I know your contract with Sony (CBS) prohibits you from releasing 5.1 CDs of their products, but this is NOT a CBS product.  If you got the original master tapes, getting the original 8 track master would not be much more difficult.  Please try a little harder next time."}

However, it made up for it rather nicely with the cover of \"The Look Of Love\" which has reminiscence of the Philly Soul sound from the 70's. His was an even better version than Vanilla Fudge's. He also did a top notch cover of \"You Lost That Loving Feeling\". I write this not because we happen to share the same last name, but because it's some good sounding soul music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember hearing \"Woman to Woman\" when it hit the Top 40 back in 1975. Good song, but it didn't particularly rock my world. And I think that was the last time I heard much from Shirley Brown. But she kept recording music, most of it very good by all accounts, and when I saw this album pop up in a local shop recently, memories of 1975 came bursting back and I thought: why not buy it? Well, I did and I'm very, very happy that I finally listened to more than one song by Shirley Brown. Wow, what a voice! Why wasn't she up there with Aretha, knocking down the soul barricades during the rest of the 1970s? Some really great songs on here, many with much more sass and oomph than \"Woman to Woman.\" Soul fans, check this one out. Very impressive album."}

No disrespect to Ms. Wright, but... there's just no comparison! Shirley is an amazing soul singer and she delivers the lyrics with true skill, expression and class. Why is she not more well-known?! Going through the rest of the album, I loved it just as much as the title track. I especially enjoyed \"It Ain't No Fun.\" When Shirley speaks in her songs, it really feels genuine, unscripted and exclusive. This is a great 70's soul album and I highly recommend it."}

THIS CD FALLS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO PHASES. THIS ALBUM WAS ON THE POLYDOR LABEL AND WAS PRODUCED BY ERIC CLAPTON, WHO IDOLIZED FREDDIE (I GOT TO SEE THEM PERFORM TOGETHER ON TOUR AT ROOSEVELT STADIUM IN NEW JERSEY IN 1975 OR 1976).

I am a big fan of Freddy's guitar playing -- but it is the vocals that really captivated me with this album. He does this thing with his voice, it is hard to describe but he seems to hold a note and then increase its volume (any vocalists out there?) -- I had never heard this before and was fascinated by it. I found myself singing along trying to imitate it (pretty funny as I really can't sing)! Anyway I had a uniquely inspired blues-jam guitar lesson immediately after that -- my guitar teacher was blown away.  The \"vibe\" just sank in on the drive in.  Can't be bad.  I prefer this original album over some of the Freddy King compilations and collections that are available (I own 2 of those currently!). Recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It seems to me that in 1966 Donovan was already in that special asteral plane The Beatles, Stones, Beach Boys and everyone else was seeking to be. Sunshine Superman and Mellow Yellow were but glimpses of the cosmic landscape Donovan would lay on us in A Gift From A Flower To A Garden. And if that was not enough, the addition of For Little Ones, is as near a perfect compilation of charming English childrens songs, as can be found this side of Atlantis. In a world full of tinkers, magpies, enchanted gypsies and starfish, Donovan resides as the man-child truberdour strumming his guitar and banjo as he sings us all to sleep."}

This is a fitting title, for it is a gift, still. Donovan, despite losing favor among modern poet-songwriters, is under-appreciated, in my opinion. The 22 songs on this album are among the best composed and released by Donovan. At the time this was originally released, in 1967, I found the popular Kahlil Gibran to be exceedingly compatible with thoughts and sentiments expressed by Donovan in song.

Of course this had to happen in the early 80's when everyone made their stinky synthesizer robot boy album and this one's no exception. Like The Human League with a flute player. Very Un-Tull, so was Under Wraps; at least 'A' had Eddie Jobson, chops a plenty, and still a nod or two to the more earthy past. Pass on this one please!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's incredible that an album as obscure as this is still in print on vinyl. That said, the album itself was totally groundbreaking for 1968, especially with all of the early electronic effects (ring modulators particularly) used in the music. It's also worth noting that there is no guitar on the album- instead, the band opts for lots of really solid violin and awesome keyboards. The songs themselves are all very well written, especially those on side 2. My personal favorites are probably \"Where is Yesterday\", \"Love Song for the Dead Che\", and \"Stranded in Time\". The album isn't all too accessible initially, but with enough listening all of the tracks will eventually grow on you. And the vinyl pressing itself rules. Very quiet pressing, and comes in the original manila envelope. Would highly recommend to Jefferson Airplane fans, but anybody could enjoy this album. Well worth $20."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Yes, I love this album. This Sundazed version is preferred because of all the bonus tracks and the edifying interviews with Byrd and Moskowitz. And, of course, the sound. The Edsel release is also nice and actually more like the original because the original had no bonus cuts either (!), but it has some booklet comments. Got the virgin vinyl through a mail order house called Records Unlimited--pretty modern for those days, eh? So here we have a few crazy university people manifesting a well-composed and mighty trippy psychedelic record for posterity--and extra credit, I presume. A brilliant odd duck swimming amongst all the less brilliant ducks. A singular creative adventure completely worthy of years of happy listening. Inspiring enough that I even took a whack at playing a couple of these tunes in public. Wanna see faces get weird?"}

{"label": 9, "raw": "After thirteen years in the music business,Toni Braxton is an R&B legend. On her debut album,this one,Braxton pleases her fans with ANOTHER SAD SONG,which \"hips and hops\". It \"says so much\" like a similarly entitled Elton John composition and recording. BREATHE AGAIN is very smooth R&B and so is YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME. Some of these songs were written by Diane Warren who wrote hits for Michael Bolton. Braxton's rise to fame led to a duet recording with ex-Doobie Brother Michael McDonald for his MOTOWN 2 album,released last year. The other songs are great. There is a short reprise of BA,which is Track 12 of this CD. Braxton also caught the attention of Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds and Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid who served as producers and session musicians for this album. Currently,Reid is president of Arista Records who also produced music for Avril LaVigne."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "One of the best albums of the 90s, this album had some of the most momentous crossover appeal ever. During its first couple of years it was all over black urban radio, yet it was tastefully restrained enough to have continued success on adult contemporary and soft rock radio stations to this day. \"Another Sad Love Song\", \"Breathe Again\", \"You Mean The World To Me\", \"How Many Ways\" and \"Seven Whole Days\" are among the true gems of contemporary R&B. Her next album, Secrets, had a couple of sizable hits and is generally good, if not as brilliant as this. However, after that, she was forced to declare bankruptcy, and since then, her quest to reclaim her wealth has resulted in a series of subpar albums that simply cannot touch the greatness of this one."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton's self-titled debut CD was undoubtedly the best album ever released by LaFace Records.  Unlike most of her contemporaries, Toni Braxton is a truly soulful singer whose emotive and soul-stirring vocals breathe life and give meaning to even the most mundane material. Sultry, sensuous, romantic and classy ballads like \"Breathe Again\", \"Best Friend\", \"You Mean The World To Me\", \"Candlelight\" and \"Love Srought You Home\" were all major hits that deservedly propelled this CD to multi-platinum status and made Ms. Braxton an international superstar. L.A. Reid, Babyface and the other producers and songwriters who worked on this album gave Toni Braxton some truly first-rate songs but her stunning and ultra-elegant vocals are your real reason for buying this CD."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton's debut single, &quot;Another Sad Love Song,&quot; caught my attention like no other in 1993. It encouraged me to go out and buy her debut album, and it exceeded my expectations. Every song on this album was  either a hit or had the potential to become a hit. It's a good album to  listen to after a long day, or if you just feel like relaxing. The  highlights include &quot;Breathe Again,&quot; &quot;You Mean The World To  Me,&quot; &quot;Love Shoulda Brought You Home,&quot; and &quot;Best  Friend,&quot; most of which was produced by the then-popular duo of L.A.  and Babyface. One listen of this album proves that it is one to keep for  the ages..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This CD is so tight it's difficult to describe.  Every singlesong is straight.  From the first one, to D.E.E.P. they are all easyto listen to.  I judge a CD by how many tracks it has that I love to listen to each time they come on.The subject matter involves most classic rap themes, but embraces knowledge, and acknowledges the destabilizing effect that hip hop culture can have on those not prepared for it.This CD has 8 or 9 classics on it.  I mean every time the song comes on, you just bob your head and zone out.  Dre's lyrics are unstoppable, Big Boi's lyrics are unstoppable, plus on the one skit, they let you know just what it's like to be an Outkast.&quot;an outkast is someone who isn't accepted in society because of his hair, his beliefs or his skin color, now ask yourself, are you an outkast.  If you believe the fundamental truths contained in this album you probably are."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Outkast's first album is one of those albums that you buy and keep it in constant rotation. The production was great and their flow was on point plus the guest appearances were a nice touch. Standout Tracks: MYINTROTOLETUKNOW, AINT NO THANG, SOUTHERNPLAYALISTICADILLACMUSIK, CALL OF THE WILD, PLAYERS BALL(original and reprise are cool with me), CLAIMIN TRUE, GIT UP GIT OUT, CRUMBLIN HERB,HOOTIE HOO and DEEP. Filler: Funky Ride is kind of boring but thats it. Bottom Line: Southernplayalisticadillacmusik is a highlight album of 94 easily. Songs like Aint No Thang, Player's Ball, Git Up Git Out and the title track are all songs that make this album a requirement for any rap fan's collection. Also recommended by Outkast: Atliens."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "OutKast's debut: \"Southernplayalisticadillacmusik\" is nothing short of fire!  It is a combination of great rhythm, neat lyrics, and bass heavy, early to mid 90's Dirty South G-Funk beats.  This album is great lowrider music. A standout track is \"Ain't No Thang,\" which has really deep head nodding bass, and hard hitting, hot headed gangsta lyrics from the Organized Noize duo!  Some of the beats hint slightly at West Coast G-Funk like \"Claimin' True,\" but even with that, you can see that the deep southern influence is the prevalent as it is throughout.  This album was the launching pad for OutKast's rap and pop success, and rightly so."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Highlights are You're Making Me High, Talking In His Sleep, Find Me A Man, Let It Flow, Why Should I Care, Come On Over Here and I Love Me Some Him.Filler? Not a lot, but Un-break My Heart comes close and In The Late Of Night/Toni's Secrets is OK and nothing to speak of. So I guess that means no filler! ^_^;;Cover Art: A-Songwriting: B+Vocals: B-Vocal Emotion: A-Production: B+Overall: 4.3754.375 = 4.384.38 stars."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Secrets by Toni Braxton is her most beloved and best-selling album of her career. This album is pretty good but it's also a mixed bag as well. After a thousand listens to, Un-Break my Heart is just plain nauseating! You're Making Me High is probably her strongest single ever, love those naughty lyrics and pulsating beat. How Could An Angel Break My Heart is a beautiful ballad which was co-written by Braxton. The rest of the songs are pretty ordinary and jeez most of the time I can't understand what she is singing, she needs to enuicate her words. This album is a great flashback to the mid-90s but that's pretty much it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In 1992,after catching the attention of Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds and current Arista Records president Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid,Toni Braxton landed a contract with Arista's subsidiary label,LaFace. That label,which is a combination of the nicknames,was founded by Edmonds and Reid. When Braxton's debut album was released the following year,she became an instant success. R&B,rap and hip-hop fans fell in love with her talented singing vocals. The most memorable track from this album is UN-BREAK MY HEART,which is of course,smooth R&B. I just love the sound of Edmonds' guitar on that song. When I first heard the song in 1996 when this album was released,I thought it was Gloria Estefan who recorded it since her voice sounds much like Braxton's. That same year,Edmonds produced Eric Clapton's hit CHANGE THE WORLD from the movie PHENOMENON starring John Travolta. The other songs are great. A few years later,Reid would do business with another great artist,Avril LaVigne."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton came out with her sophomore album, Secrets, in June 1996. Toni revealed a more sexier, yet classier image, and it was reflected on each of these songs. A few songs that stand out on the album are the title track, How could an Angel Break My Heart, There's No Me Without You, and You're Making Me High. A few standout ballads would be In the Late of Night, which was written by Jon B. Another ballad that sticks out from this album is Find Me a Man. Secrets is definitely Toni Braxton at her finest. This cd is definitely a good one that shouldn't be kept secret!!!!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you can...tell anyone you know about this CD!Toni has outdone herself: most of the tracks produced by Babyface (including the Summer 1996 # 1 hit YOU'RE MAKING ME HIGH), but with support from David Foster (UN-BREAK MY HEART, written by Diane Warren and one of the best selling singles ever...), R. Kelly (I DON'T WANT TO), Soulshock &amp; Carlin (I LOVE ME SOME HIM, extra nice tune to me...) and Toni Rich Project (COME ON OVER HERE).Add some studio help from Keny G. and a soundtrack tune (LET IT FLOW, from WAITING TO EXHALE), and the 3 bonus remixes of all of the singles off the CD - including the dancefloor anthem for UN-BREAK MY HEART...You will come up with one of the best R'n'B albums ever"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni's sophomore set continued her progression from an excellent debut.  This is a strong collection of songs where Toni's vocal phrasings and the song melodies are beautiful from one track to the next.  On the Babyface productions, it's like he & Toni are both halves of one brain - and although more Adult Contemporary than straight R&B;, the songs are still memorable, melodic and beautiful.I saw Toni on a commercial recently which prompted my little Toni-athon and rediscovered singles that I hadn't listened to in a while: THERE'S NO ME WITHOUT YOU, WHY SHOULD I CARE, IN THE LATE OF NIGHT and FIND ME A MAN in addition to the \"hits\" that I love: LET IT FLOW, I LOVE ME SOME HIM, UNBREAK MY HEART & YOU'RE MAKING ME HIGH.Overall this is a great second offering from one of my favorite vocalists who we need to hear more new music from!  Please come back soon, Toni!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "When any artist's first album is so on fire as Toni Braxton's debut was, it's a pretty safe assumption that subsequent releases will have a hard time living up to it, and that, to a moderate extent, is the case here. She still had some fire left in her, as evidenced on the hip-hoppish but respectable hit \"You're Makin' Me High\" and the emotional ballad \"Unbreak My Heart\". Also good are the ballad \"Let It Flow\" and the sultry, teasing ditty \"Talking In His Sleep.\" Unfortunately, before she had a chance to make a third album, the bankruptcy set in, and since then she has been just a shell of her former self on every album she's made after this one."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This CD packed a powerful punch when it hit the streets and airwaves.  Toni was at the the top of the game before the industry pushed mannequins and Barbie dolls into the spotlight and shoved their non-singing selves down America's throat..(forgive me..small rant). Anyway, Toni puts down this set in a real way..she sings from her soul and does a great job on each song.  Yes, I still play this CD.  It's a much more mature set than her first CD and better produced than her subsequent releases.  Hope one day she gets back in the studio and gives her some quality adult music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The 5 stars isnt for her beauty, for her musical talent. I have listened to this album countless times. Without a doubt a classic. Im not too big on much R & B I am more into underground hiphop but I have to admit this is music that will be felt from all musical background based audiences. I heard somewhere this album is like 10+ platinum.. and that isnt too hard to believe. Her 2 most international hits \"Makin me High\" and \"Unbreak My Heart\" on on this album. So make sure you get this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton waited 3 years to release her sophomore effort, Secrets, which follows the same formula as its predecessor while managing to sound fresh and new. The big ballad \"Un-break My Heart\" is the obvious smash hit, but other classics include the sultry \"You're Makin' Me High\" and the relaxing \"Let it Flow.\" Smooth album cuts like \"Why Should I Care\" and \"Come on Over Here\" ensure that the album moves with a soulful, slow-burn feel from beginning to end. Secrets is the rare sophomore album that outdoes the artist's debut. 4 Stars."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "This a much better improvement than her debut which was good but not great like this one. The cd starts of coming alive and then soars with tracks like Talking in his sleep, Find me a man, Why should I care and I love me some him. After 8 years on the market this cd still has a refined sound to it as if debut yesturday . If you don't or never owned a Toni B album this is a very good one to start with. Also Try THE HEAT &amp; More up to date More Than A Woman."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tony Rich is a wonderful all-round artist. This entire album was produced, written, arranged and performed by him with only a small amount of help on a few songs by additional musicians. And every song is so good even though the album only spawned one major hit, &quot;Nobody knows&quot;. The other songs were for the most part, overlooked, and it is a shame, because there's not one filler in the entire album. The 16 page booklet includes numerous photos and all the lyrics. This really is a wonderful album, and highly recommended. If you are a fan of Brian McKnight then you will for sure love Tony Rich too."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Along with Aquemini, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. At first this album may seem a little bit out there. When you look at the the cover, they look like some \"aliens or genies. But once you start listening you realize how good songs like \"Wheelz of Steel\" and \"Mainstream\" are. Then the rest of the album just falls into place. People who don't own the album may have heard the radio songs \"ATLiens\" and \"Elevators\". If you think those are good but haven't heard the rest of the album, then you're in for a treat. The rest of the album is just as good and better in many cases. This album is also really good for people who like to blaze it up and listen to some music that will really f#%k with you. Overall it is an excellent album for anybody and if you haven't heard it, I would recommend getting it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "they expose a nerve with this one!most rappers shout-out god in they credits, but few touch on somethin spiritual in their actual lyrics...outkast aint nowhere near saints, but you can feel the spiritual searchin in the undertones of what they are sayin...soul searchin is what hip-hop needs more of.  that's what sets this release from other hip-hop classics; these boys are always lookin to grow beyond not just where they at, but from where they might be tomorrow....but yall proly aint feelin me on that, so i'll just say this:&quot;me anyuuu  yomama an yocuz zin toooooooooo......&quot;"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "ATLiens, in my opinion, is a better CD thanSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzik.  Both are definite hip hop classics, but I have this draw to ATLiens.  I can't explain what it is.The CD is very different from the first.  Where the first was built around the gangster concept, this CD builds its own concept.  One I have yet to put a name to.My favorite songs include Two Dope Boys, ATLiens, Jazzy Belle, Elevators, Babylon, Millenium, and Extra-Terrestrial.Definite Must Have."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is a good album. The production is pretty good, the guest appearances go well with Pac( Method Man, Redman, Big Syke, Outlaws, Daz, Kurupt) and Pac maintains a decent flow. However his subject matter on this album strays from a more focused and serious Pac to the full fledged thug. The subject matter of All Eyez on Me does not equal up to the level of his previous efforts such as Me Against the World, and 2Pacalypse Now. Once again, a pretty good album for beats and to bump in the car, but Pac left the focused, thought provoking lyrics in exchange for the thug."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album will undoubtedly remain one of the best rap albums of all time.  Pac rips it on every track, never falling short of excellent.  &quot;Ambitionz Az A Ridah&quot; is a rap anthem and it's highly unfortunate that Fabolous though that he could do the song any justice.  Eyez proves that it has major staying power it is almost always played at any hood party, with everyone their singing the lyrics to every song.  The title track is amazing, with the haunting beat and Pac's exceptional delivery.  &quot;Life Goes On,&quot; &quot;Only God Can Judge Me,&quot; and &quot;Tradin War Stories&quot; let us take a peek a 2Pac's heart, and we found it's one that we related to.

{"label": 9, "raw": "2Pac emerged hardened and hungry with All Eyez on Me, the first double-disc album of original material in hip-hop history. All Eyez on Me is 2Pac the thug icon in all his brazen excess, throwing off all self-control and letting it all hang out -- even if some of it would have been better kept to himself. In that sense, it's an accurate depiction of what made him such a volatile and compelling personality, despite some undeniable filler. On the plus side, this is easily the best production he's ever had on record. Despite some good moments, the second disc is slowed by filler and countless guest appearances, plus a few too many thug-lovin' divas crooning their loyalty. Erratic though it may be, All Eyez on Me is nonetheless carried off with the assurance of a legend in his own time, and it stands as 2Pac's magnum opus"}

Life Goes On, Cali Love RMX, Only God Can Judge Me, Picture Me Rollin, All Eyez on Me,  I Ain't Mad At Cha, and many more. Life Goes On is one of 2pac's deepest and most impressive tracks he ever did. So is Only God can Judge Me. I know you don't want me babbling on about how good this album is so I will give you 3 words. CLASSIC BUY NOW."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is probably the most overated of all 2pac's work.  You would think that after his release from prison, 2pac would have delivered an album that is a better commentary on his life trials prior to prison.  Instead, 2pac goes right back to the sh-t, focusing too much on, and overdramatizing the thug-life. This drawn-out, sprawling, if not tedious double album tends to be annoying at times. However, stand-out tracks like &quot;How Do You Want It&quot;, &quot;Bring the Pain&quot;, California Love&quot;, I aint Mad at Cha&quot; &quot;Wonda Why they Call You B--tch&quot; and a few others takes on all the needless and uncalled for tracks, not making it a complete throw-away.  While it's certainly not as consistent as his previous efforts, this double CD still contains the best from one of the most prolific rappers in Hip Hop.Peace! El-715"}
