I had heard of the series previously but was only convinced of buying it after seeing an intervewi with the actress. What a suprise: this is a somewhat lesscorrect version of Friends meets My Name Is Earl. I agree that this may not be correct at all since this series has no respect for conventional moarl issues such as lying about having cancer, discovering a friend's grandfather was a nazi. It also tackles the strange love men sometimes has for guns ets... In some ways it is difficult to describe and understand if you have not seen this gem of comedy."}

Other than the time travel there is not much science fiction here.  It is very interesting to see the Dr interacting with his &#34;crew&#34; and how he is more like the captain of a ship rather than the more active character that he becomes over time.  Probably the most interesting thing about this episode is how it shows the cultural mores of the 1960s.  If you enjoy ancient TV this is a gem.

My favorite thing is that unlike Dora the Explorer or Diego, no one *ever* encourages the audience to be loud. Also, while they do &#34;play Blue's Clues&#34; in every episode, the shows are not all the same. The structure changes slightly each time, which is fantastic.

Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Massachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film. Everything moves a lot more slowly, and many shots needed tighter editing."}

More often than not,  most Sci Fi hasn't developed varied plots, but for now, until the industry has more imaginative writers, it is ok. I prefer real science fiction, not blurred into fantasy of mythical beasts and vampires, which end up moving the imagination back into reality and snuffing out the momentum of plot advancement.My only suggestions are: keep it real with emotional responses, don't overdo it with fake shooting scenes, devise unique ways to solve problems (McGiverish), and grow the the characters relationships.

The idea of Dexter being a sociopath is not exploited to its full potential, IMO.  Too much of the time he blends in so much you forget all about it, then you have to be reminded by forced voice overs and flashbacks.  This is a good DVD set though, I see lots of folks complaining about the transfer.  What can I say, don't spend 50 zillion bucks on your TV/Home theatre and you won't be so disappointed.  For 20 bones you get 12 doses of Dexter, AND two episodes of Brotherhood, and one of The Tudors if you have the time to screw around with the PC feature.  Not bad considering that people were lining up out the door to fork over 100 bucks for The Sopranos not too long ago."}

The story lines are chilling and keep you on the edge of your seat - you are always guessing.  The writing is superb and witty and smart.  I never read Jeff Lindsays books, but now I think I'll go buy them and read cover to cover.Trust me; this show is one that grabs you and won't let go till the ride is over.

It took a couple of episodes for me to warm up to the character, but I did.I soon found myself rooting for a serial-killer who works for the cops which, to me anyway, means the writing is pretty good. The setting of post-Miami-Vice Miami is a visually interesting backdrop - although a little too much at times. Dexter has my interest and I'm devouring DVD after DVD as fast as they can be delivered. So far, it's scratchin' my itch for a solid cable series."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This isn't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C. Hall's performance and voiceover work are very strong. He's stretched out further than he could with his character on the late, great Six Feet Under."}

They are every one a spell binding, can't wait till I see the next one kind of a series.  One of the things that make it outstanding is that they don't use an episode as a stand alone show.

There should be more confusion and uncertainty going on in that small town more than anything else.  Not these emotional scenes that in real life would never happen.There's some nice twists from some of the main characters, but it is pretty hard keeping up with everything, and understanding what's going on can be a difficult enough task.

Bob Hope is loyal to his wife but a misdialing of the phone gets him mixed up with a sexy movie starlet(played pefectly by Elke Sommer).  The rumor at the time in Hollywood is that Hope had requested to make this film with her as co-star.  I can't confirm that, but seeing the film, you could understand if he did.The film is pretty amusing and if you are a Bob Hope (or, to be honest, Elke Sommer) fan, then grab this.

Secondly, they use bullets instead of lasers. My guess is the producers did this to save money on special effects. Third, the society of this advanced culture still has people smoking and alcoholics and they haven't even cured cancer. A society enlightend and advanced as this(at least 100-200 years or more advanced than earth) would have cured the addiction of smoking and acoholism and/or outlawed it. Almost every actor was a drinker, smoker or both. I suspect tobacco companies and alcohol beverage companies paid the actors and probably the producers under the table to smoke in the series.

{"label": 0, "raw": "Great Show!  Nerds and Spooks.  It's the perfect partnership.  Chuck, a Stanford drop out, working at the Buy More, gets an  email from his sort of best friend.  The email contains current and past U.S. intelligence.  The email imprints all this data into Chuck's memory.  Soon after, Chuck meets Sara and falls head over heals for her.  It turns out, she is his handler, and charged with keeping him safe, and the information intact.  This is the story of how Chuck grows out of being just a Nerd Herder, to a real spy with the help of friends, family, the CIA, and Sara.  It's a story of nerds, love, action, and comedy.  We love it."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Yes, my inner-geek rejoiced minutes into the first episode of Chuck:S1, with the reference to Prince's \"Batdance\" song.  Constant pop-culture references are just one of the things that makes Chuck about the best show on TV and probably too smart to last very long.The cast is fantastic: from Chuck himself to Big Mike, Captain Awesome, Morgan, and even the cameo roles, everyone is well written with depth. Adam Baldwin is one of the most underappreciated comedic actors in Hollywood. Its a damn funny show, but more than that, it includes a little bit of everything, from suprisingly solid action to a dab of romance.My main worry is how long they can sustain the show's formula, from Chuck's memory flashes/missions to the tension between he and Yvonne Strahovski.  But I will be there for the whole ride."}

But Life really knocks it out of the park from the first episode and it doesn't go downhill at all.  I'm so sorry that this series didn't really make it,  because I loved it. Charlie Crews is a fascinating character, complex,  striving.  I loved the 'Zen' theme.  The series as a whole has 2 streams - the overarching who set up Charlie and killed his friends,  and the week to week cases and both are excellent.Watch it, you'll want to watch the rest."}

I do watch some of the shows available online offered by the different networks on their sites. Amazon happened to offer the first episode of Life free.  Free is a good thing and also a great way to gain viewers like myself.  I am hooked.  \"Life\" is not your run of the mill cop show.  Charlie is not your run of the mill cop.  I own season 1 on DVD and have already pre-ordered season 2(have to love Amazon's price guarantee)and season 2 is a must see and in my case must own.  If you haven't seen Life you haven't lived."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Quirky, clever, and very satisfying, Life is an excellent police procedural that takes place in Los Angeles. LAPD detective partners Crews and Reese are perfect foils, seeming opposites that play off each other's best and worst personality traits in such a way that the viewer ends up liking both characters, a difficult feat. Actors Lewis and Shahi do an excellent job. Lewis' American accent is spot on, and Shahi (a very beautiful woman) does the tough-cop, no-nonsense, recovering addict role just right. Other characters/actors are also great. Although I wanted the series to go on and on (it was cancelled), please don't be hesitant to watch the 2 seasons that are available. The underlying mystery, developed a little at a time through each episode, is satisfyingly (if perhaps not completely) resolved at the end. I watched the last episode last night, and I'm a little sad now. I will miss Crews and Reese."}

I really like the format of it - the way the characters' actions and dialogue are set up.  Adding Alan Arkin to the cast was an excellent choice.  He's such a good actor as is the main character Charlie, played by Damian Lewis, who plays this insightful man who is so grateful for the simple things in life having been in prison for many years for a crime he did not commit.  Very refreshing!"}

A cop, wrongly accused (not so surprising a plot----aren't they always???) but still I continued watching.  The interesting hook was that he not only took the references huge settlement but had negotiated to keep his old job as a detective in the same place that accused, arrested, prosecuted and jailed him.  Hmmmmm, different. The humor is a sideline to a jaundiced look at the new/former workplace and although I think the female partner's role is a bit over the top, the cases are interesting and the tracking of who actually committed the crime he went to prison for is well thought out and executed. Thank you.&#8203;"}

It was a little sad knowing the series end was coming, but the writers did a good job of keeping the action flowing right up to the end. All of the characters seemed to get their special moments during this season - the only character I missed was Anna from the early seasons.I don't want to spoil anyone's surprise, but we get a few visits and flashbacks to old characters, as well as a few new ones along the way. Most of the Chuck fans should be happy with the ending as well.

The funniest part in this show is the overt discomfort that is evident in these guys when they find themselves in everyday situations surrounded by dumb folk like you and me.  My favorite episode was when Sheldon got the flu and became the center of the universe (unto himself) and the great effort his friends went to in order to avoid him during his illness.

I heard good things about it, but I could never fit it into my DVR's schedule without getting rid of some other shows that I like. The cast of four nerds and a hot blonde is perfect and the writers have to be just as smart as the main characters to come up with such intricate and funny dialogue. This show is enjoyable even if you don't get all the tech geek talk, but if you understand why one of the characters playing Halo 3 gets pissed off and killed because he got a Needler weapon, then this show will blow your mind."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "After resisting the urge to make big changes in season three, season four changed everything, especially the team that works with House, which took a bit longer than it really needed, but which led to a two-part ending that's among the best episodes the show ever produced. The DVDs look and sound excellent, and the extras are a step up from the previous release, though they are missing a few of the more popular elements from previous sets. Unlike last season, this is a fine opportunity for new fans to jump on board, with a season that's practically self-contained, yet a wonderful continuation on the show's storylines."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "At first I kinda felt the 3rd season of Prison Break started off a little stale.  Then by the third episode I was hooked as usual.  You got Scofield dumped in the most horrific prison known to man.  You got Bellick walking around half-naked lookin' like something the cat dragged in, after it threw it up.  Mahone is going through some serious withdrawal issues.  And Linc on the outside pretty much clueless.  My boy Sucre is still hangin' around dedicated to Michael for all he's done.  T-Bag continues his menacing wrath. Newcomers, Whistler and Lechero and the vicious Gretchen a.k.a Susan B. make for some very interesting storylines.  I agree that that daggone writer's strike did make this season seems rushed.  It's all worth it though to see Wentworth Miller all hot and sweaty between a rock and a hard place."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I enjoyed this third season more than the previous seasons. I found the acting and storyline much superior than previously. I like all the twists throughout the episodes, keeping one at the edge of his seat. Outguessing the plot can be difficult.  This season is also action packed, with every episode offering non-stop action. The way all the characters come together is also fascinating and remarkable, and their motives are unknown. Even the temporary break between Michael and Lincoln over the death of ****** (removed as not to spoil the story) was unexpected.The inmates inside Sona, the Panamanian prison from where Michael Scofield must escape, were very believable.  His escape attempts were well conceived and believable as well. The Panamanian landscape offered an exotic touch to the storyline, different from the maximum-security prison at Fox River.I really recommend this season, and can't wait for season four."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "It's truely unfortunate how quickly this show took a nose-dive after such an excellent first season. This is easily the worst season of Heroes, but to fair this is due to the writer's strike and their best writer from the first season leaving; he returns for the forth season but it's too late to save the show. Having said all that there's still some great progression with the main characters and a fair amount of interesting new characters that works well within season 2. If you're only a casual fan of the show I'd recommend skipping this one, as it doesn't really tie much into the rest of the series aside from a few details, and only purchase the first season, but if you're a pretty big fan then get all of them since there's only four seasons."}

My co-workers dropped out after only 4 episodes. I recorded the show so that I could fast forward through, hoping it would get back on track.  It never did, I kept fast forwarding through the entire season.Season 1 was great, never to be equaled by season 2.  Maybe season 3 will be better, if anyone is still watching.

The show features well-rounded characters with realistic problems and believable flaws.

Or maybe the fictional characters just remind me of my own classmates, teachers, and coaches.  But, whatever the reason, this is one great show, well-acted and under-recognized."}

Teke the page Kenneth, he tends to be very often way too geeky for the good of the series. Also Alec Bladwin's character is way over the top and somewhat unrealistic (OK, it is a comedy series) but he has improved over Season 1.

I would bet there are millions of detectives that would love to have that gift to help solve murders. For Raines, Jeff Goldblum's character, it provides the ideal vehicle for the hilarious, rapid dialogue Jeff is known and loved for. He tries so hard to fight the gift, but when it proves so useful, he then welcomes it. The fun occurs when the ghosts talk when he is with other people and he either fights answering or answers and  then has to cover it up.

Still it takes guts to remove major characters and the Samantha Carter character does a good job at being the bases new leader.

While we still have the Wraith and Replicators in the series they haven't seemed as much the viable threat they were made out to be in the previous seasons or series though they still are a threat.

All in all, it is vastly superior when compared to the previous seasons.The producers included a bit more than the standard fare of special features, more to help fatten the DVD load.

Most people make fun of the network, but I bet they haven't watched this show. It has good acting (the two leads are very likeable), clever and often funny writing, very good special effects, a classic rock soundtrack and a well thought out storyline. Not to mention all the different hot babes that pop up almost every week.Supernatural gets a lot of involvement from the writers and directors of the The X-Files and it shows in it's quality.

Overall, I enjoyed watching the whole series, though it could have been better.Would I recomend it? Depends on what day you ask me. It could go either way. Guess you have to watch it and see for yourself. If you are going to watch it, by all means start at the beginning or there's no chance you will understand what is going on."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Though I was captivated by the series right from the start, as the seasons progressed it only became more engrossing. I thought that Season Three really took off, and felt that anything attempted beyond that would be a let down. Alas! Season 4 tops them all for the depth of presented ideas, characterization, and adrenalin raising action.THough there were, I believe, 77 episodes in the series, as I approached the final episodes I felt a close friend was packing and departing from me. Then, in keeping with that feeling of loss, the final episode brought, I thought, the reality of life for us all to the center, and that is exactly how any production that &#34;holds the mirror up to nature&#34; as well as this series did should have ended. Magnificent! The finest video production I have ever experienced."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I almost gave up on this show afeter Season 3, which I thought it was not bad by itself, but simply inferior to the amazing Seasons 1 and 2.Anyway, people sometimes tend to demand that each single episode of a TV show be a master-piece of film making. This is simply not possible. The shooting and writing schedule is frenetic, they are exposed to ratings, to threat of being cancelled, etc, etc. the producers of a show (usually) try do do their best.Of course, sometimes there is sloppy and lazy writing, but I think this is more the xception than the rule.In this season, sometimes I got pissed with some cheap \"matrix-sequel style\" riddles and philosophy, but other than this (and KAte Sackhoff as Starbuck - I simply thins she is so unpleasant and such a weak actress that the Starbuck character is obnoxious sometimes) it was a superior season than season 3."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Some spoilers......This show remains as dark, gripping, and challenging as ever.  The Cylon rebels break away from the others, while the humans still struggle with the fact that any one of them could be revealed to be a Cylon--at any time.  The cast gives powerful performances all around, and the revelation to Adama by a certain person was wrenching to watch.  Olmos showed the anguish and shock that any one of us would feel upon learning that a trusted confidante was never a human at all.Richard Hatch, from the original series, is great with his delivery and timing.  He should be given more employment.  James Callis as Baltar leads us into uncharted territory as he becomes a religious cult leader, while Mary McDonnell shows how hard it is to maintain grace and hope while battling cancer.Then they get where they wanted to go, and....oh, I can't tell you, but of course they had to leave us hanging there!"}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This series has a variety of plots, and the chemistry works well among all the characters.  It is fast moving with a lot of action, yet it keeps its humanity.  The main characters are all fascinating because they've previously been clandestine agents and have many tricks of their trade from which to draw.  The female lead character is very strong and strong-willed with her own mind and actions, which is very refreshing.  She also has a good heart, along with the other 2 male leads, so they find themselves constantly helping other people instead of sticking to their own agendas.  All 3 three main charcters are fearless and capable of extracting themselves from dangerous situations and people.  The violence is not graphic and not overdone.  Recommend Seasons 1 - 4.  Haven't seen 5 yet. Have a good day, everyone."}

I also wanted to see Kristen Stewart in something else, and I watched this one and another one she was in, and I'm extremely impressed with her.  I expected another Bella, but in both movies, she was totally different.

But the laughs and the sex scenes become fewer as the story unfolds and the Duchovny character's inner sadness and longing for permanent connection becomes the dominant theme.I found this series a rather effective critique on the emptiness of the fast-lane L.A. world the characters inhabit and of our insistence on eternal youth which inhibits people growing up to become true adults."}

At several times you will find yourself wanting to be in Hank's shoes and other times so glad you live a relatively benign life. A very fun watch and i would recommend it to anyone that does not mind excessive profanity and at times nudity."}

When I heard that description of this series, I was under-whelmed and avoided watching it until the final season was set to begin...but my daughter talked us into it.  THANK GOODNESS SHE DID!

As I sit here waiting for the final season to unfold in another week, I look at the cover to the Season One set and think about the Walter White that was. To have managed such an evolution in the central character of a television program in the manner it was done is a remarkable feat -- unprecedented, really. There's a lot to object to here in a moral and ethical sense, but as a fictional meditation on the nature of those choices -- and that's in large part what fiction is about anyway -- Breaking Bad is hard to beat. Everything comes together so well: Acting, production, writing. This is one of the great works of the screen, big or small. Highly recommended."}

He even enlists a former student and high school dropout to help him in his new endeavor.  The show is absorbing and very interesting.  It is low key and not showy but doesn't hesitate to see humor in the man's predicament.  His wife is pregnant with their second child.  Their first child has cerebral palsy.  His sister in law is a shop lifter married to a fervent DEA agent.  The dropout he ignored in school now becomes his favorite pupil.  So much for role models.  Good show with a lot going for it."}

It's very unpoliitcally correct in a bad way , but it also does depict how nasty some people are. Meth of course is destroying whole communities , so the writers picked the most offensive drug they could for the character to fall into. After all breaking bad pot man wouldn't be that offensive would it?  The acting is great , with  emmies' won by cast members over the years.

He's also got a brother in law who is in law enforcement, and a talent for cooking meth that makes him a legend in Albuquerque.

Of course, it also means dangerous company, accidents and other physical dangers, and lots of pressure to produce more meth.minor spoiler below.....Cranston is also heartbreakingly good in the intervention scene, in which he at first lays out his case for not wanting to be sickened by the treatments...before he changes his mind.Very strong episodes."}

It's not your typical zombie flick, per se. It's not your typical stripper flick either. It's not even a horror comedy. Yet, whatever it is, it is strangely a pretty good movie. The story has something to do a with a zombie-like virus passed along to a member of a military strike-team, who then escapes to a strip club where he bites Jenna Jameson, who the bites some more people.  Robert Englund plays a strip club owner who realizes that there's a lot of money to be made in zombie strippers - until everything goes wrong.Oddly enough, I still don't know what to say about it except to see this movie.

{"label": 0, "raw": "This movie is a must see and one of the best. The film had a lot of twists toward the end but kept me interested. The film uses an unfolding mystery and atmosphere to create fear. The feel of this movie is dark and foreboding throughout the film. Simple things made this movie: the desolate seaside location...the cliffs...a burlap mask... The house itself is creepy with dark corners. Dripping water, creaking floorboards added to the ominous feel of the movie. Only one scene involved gore - and the entire theater gasped when it happened. Rueda is wonderful as the tormented mother Laura. She carries this film to the end with palpable desperation. She appeared thin, and was not made up with hair and makeup which created more belief in her character. Hollywood actresses could take notes on her believability and strong performance.TOP NOTCH scrip/chills & acting  MUST SEE!!! This movie has the feel the \"The Others\" and has an \"M.

Not your standard 'horror' fare or slasher film and audiences who don't come expecting that may find the story, upon reflection, to be quite seamless, clever and ultimately rather satisfying.  I give it 4.5 stars.  It isn't quite the odyssey that Pan's Labyrinth was (different director, same producer), but for what it sets out to do, it accomplishes much.  The cinematography is top notch, as is the acting.  Crystal clear transfer on the DVD.  A story with a bit of a twist.  A story that may leave you feeling oddly hopeful rather than frightened."}

Belen Rueda who plays the mother delivers a very strong performance and really holds the movie together. Worth seeing in theaters, even though some people failed to realize it was going to have subtitles and walked out. Don't people find out a little about a film before shelling out $10.00 to see it?

This show is amazing, each episode has the snitch of the week that goes into Witness Protection and almost every weekly story is a hit.  The real beauty of this show is the ongoing family darama between Mary and her family as well as the shenanigans between her co workers.  As a member of AA for 13+ years I can tell you the family problems related to this are very real life and they show much of this with enough humor to make me appreciate the honesty.

The last episode involved resolving (most of) the personal drama with Mary, her mom and her sister.Certainly worth the very reasonable price to buy the set."}

The on screen chemistry between Colonel Shepard, Rodney McKay, Carson Beckett & later Ronan Dex were what (in my opinion) made it the better of the two &#34;Stargate&#34; series.While it will never measure up to &#34;Battlestar Galactica,&#34; (the best sci-fi show, ever) the two of them were a great mix as they both started and ended at the same time.

Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that.

Danny De Vito was allways a problem because his character is not likeable at all in this series. The titles of the episodes say all: Mac and Charlie Die, Who Pooped the bed, Sweet Dee has a heart attack.... It does simply not hold up to the standards of the first seasons, which were irreverent funny.

Damien Lewis is so good that I started buying anything with him in it, just on the basis of the first Life season. Intelligent, funny and well plotted, far from sentimental with a hero who has more inner conflict than the current Batman but turns the opposing forces to his advantage - more of an Aikido disciple than Zen. Or both, probably.There are not that many really intelligent and funny series around (and especially surviving the ratings from your general public) so if you like your shows with lots of action but smart, with really twisted thinking and really good acting thrown in for a huge bonus, do not miss that one."}

The stories are basically stories about cops and bad guys but the way they are treated keeps me coming back and I find that I will miss it as it only went 2 seasons. They can't seem to stand good shows in Hollywood. There aremany shades of grey in this series and if you are tired of the same ol same ol' give this a spin but it's the sticking with it that willreward you."}

The lead character is quirky and even believable considering he survived 12 years in prison as a convicted cop.  His search for the &#34;real&#34; killers of the crime he was convicted for is very convoluted and involves his partner's father.  The production quality is very good.  Even though it is a crime show  (murder) , we don't feel depressed after watching.  It doesn't dwell on the gory.  I recommend this show.  Wish there were more episodes.

She does a great job, but it is a bit much, if that isn't what you are looking for.  I was never much for over done drama (same thing that made or broke Battlestar Galactica, for the most part), thats why they have daytime soaps.  Again, good show and its worth watching, you just might have to struggle through some of it."}

While I liked the first half of the season, I didn't feel like the show really gelled until the second half, with the introduction of the vicious ATF agent they truly found a focus and a story line to build towards that made the first part of the season seem inferior and paled in comparison. That said, there is excellent production values from beginning to end, the acting is great throughout and the directing, while for the most part not revolutionary, is adequate and like the show improves toward the end of this season. I'm eagerly anticipating starting season 2."}

The actors really pull in the muscle and deliver their characters authentically.  The way the mc club deals with other gangs, similar to politics.  Setting is also realistic depicting the urban decay of our Nor-Cal roadways, and urban buildings.  I just wanna know where all the award nominations are for this show.  Motorcycle Clubs are about the men, but the women in this show really pull their weight, especially Katey Sagal.

Then there is the comparative morality of corrupt politicians, cynical, venal government agencies and morally compromised businessmen. So they get into all of these wild escapades, nothing is ever what it seems and the SOA is always about 15 minutes from death, destruction and prison as one scheme after another backfires. Someone should make a reel of the many \"oh s***\" moments in the series, whenever someone says it, it has already hit the fan. But it is never boring.

{"label": 0, "raw": "This is the premature end of a really great series. It was probably the best on TV since The West Wing. Like the WW it had a great cast, strong writers and great directing. The only real problem with Boston Legal globally was besides the 3 main characters, the continuous change in the secondary characters between all seasons. This led to the loss of mainly some great female characters that were indispensable. This was in line with Ally McBeal where characters disappeared between seasons without much explanation. This has been the main problem with the series since it has not permitted continuity. Otherwise the series has been perfect. The acting from Shatner, spade and Bergen is simply wonderful. The series does end in a slightly weird manner but weird episodes was a recurrent phenomenon in thie series as well as in Ally McBeal. All I can say is may they all live happey together but we will miss them."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Despite John Thaw's acclaimed qualities as an actor, I find that he was only convincing when he played a character who was very close to himself. So, which ever of his later characters you take, you are really just left with John Thaw. Morse is very much John and, to me, the best part of the show was the views of Oxford University. The plots are incredibly complex which does not really produce a compelling detective story; the viewer, or reader, really needs some chance of being able to solve the riddle. The character of Lewis is equally poor and boredom is never far from my mind. John had a British RADA accent overlaying his boyhood Manchester brogue and it often slips quite badly which is embarrassing."}

Very handsome as he is in the later Inspector Lewis series.  GREAT SHOWS ALL."}

He is killed, and the chapter goes missing.  As Morse and Lewis dig deeper and deeper, several possible suspects emerge as to who might like to keep the information quiet, and who has the most to lose if the secrets are uncovered regarding the circumstances surrounding the crime and why it was never resolved.These shows may seem slow-moving compared to current mysteries, but the magic is in the script and acting.  Morse always has wise observations and his face is a joy to watch as John Thaw underplays the subtle emotions."}

However, I really think the show keeps improving, both in writing and comedic jokes.  To me this deserves recognition as most shows rely on the same tired formula and writing, which eventually gets lazy and repetitive (see the office).  American Dad has really tried to make itself a bit better as it grows, and this season shows it.  I'm not going to argue that its shakespeare, or the best comedy going, but I give credit where credit is due.  This volume made me laugh constantly, and unlike most american dad episodes, they didn't feel quite so disposable.  If you're a fan of american dad, its a no brainer, get it, you'll love it.

As a drunk, Tim Hutton seems to drag the show down because he is the leader of the group and impacts all the characters, so perhaps he is playing his role perfectly?!?Maybe next season, the characters will show more life.

Season Two came to a crashing halt of way over the top ideas which lead to my loss of enjoyment.While I was a huge fan ofFirefly: The Complete SeriesandSerenity [HD], I'm by no means on the Joss Wheaton bandwagon.  I've seenBuffy the Vampire Slayeronly a few times and have no desire to watch the series anytime soon.  By saying that, I want other reviewers/readers of reviews to note the objectivity in my own review."}

{"label": 0, "raw": "I'm not a huge John John Malkovich fan, but this seems like one of those rare occasions when actor and role seem perfectly matched to produce an entertaining movie. Malkovich plays Buck Howard, a failing magician loosely based on the Amazing Kreskin. Malkovich's character is both corny and charming. He undergoes a transformation from being frustrated with his fate of performing for small-town America, to finding the his big break didn't necessarily bring him what he most needed. Meanwhile, Colin Hanks (Tom Hank's son) plays a young man searching for himself after dropping out of law school. Ultimately, this movie isn't a slapstick comedy and you probably won't find yourself laughing out loud. Nonetheless, it has some funny moments and is a breath of fresh air compared to the stale comedies Hollywood has been producing (with their utterly predictable plots).I found myself unable to predict where exactly the story was going or what would happen next to Buck Howard - and I loved that. Hopefully you will too."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Colin Hanks play Troy Gable, a law school drop out. He becomes the road manager for The Great Buck Howard (John Malkovich) a flamboyant washed up mentalist. Buck plays the small towns as Colin hides from Buck his unpopularity. Buck Howard is a caricature of The Amazing Kreskin. Emily Blunt plays a publicist and love interest for Troy.  Tom Hanks has a minor role as Troy's father.The film is rather shallow and predictable. John Malkovich provides us with a quirky character who is questionably gay. Sadly, Colin Hanks lacks charisma and is unable to pull off a great performance. In spite of the short comings Malkovich gives a performance that carries the film.No f-bombs, sex, nudity. Just good PG fun."}

I always got sucked into the drama and how crazy the moms were and how much money they put into clothes and make-up. I confess I watched every episode and felt miserably sorry for the kids in every one. If you don't mind the drama, it is entertaining in just the ridiculous-ness of it all."}

There are alot of wonderful things about this show. Crafted well, acting is first rate, and while some of the plot lines are predictable, they are written and performed well. It's a great premise and the possibilities are sadly left unfulfilled. Would that it had a chance to grow into what it might well have been - one of the best things on network tv."}

This is incredible fiction.The series ends on an ambiguous note -- it doesn't really work as a series finale -- but this 13-hour journey is something I've watched three times from start to finish because it is such a delight."}

When we eagerly waiting for the new season, we would rehash the past season, making possible plot's all our own, you know, really into it. Then when the announced date came and went, we researched, what went wrong. Found out it had been cancelled.  That was my first realization that TV had become like all other business, just that. Business. So disappointed with major networks. They had managed, with Kings, to create a possible alternate future of our world, that did not involve space ships or aliens or even magic. So, watch this series, and judge for yourself, if it wasn't an excellent addition to any network line-up."}

In contrast to Arrested Development, however, the characters are not very well developed, and so I'm watching it with far less empathy than those in AD.  The lack of social empathy is more like 30 rock where only a few characters are singled out for elaboration but they are so over-caricatured and ancillary that they are unrelatable as humans: in Ted this is the zany scientists and cold ceo and in 30 rock Jenna, Tracy, the paige and the writing staff."}

For those who haven't watched it, the show is a satirical situation comedy that focuses on a fictional multi-national corporation called 'Veridian Dynamics'. The main character, Ted, is the head of research and development and oversees a quirky team of scientists and product testers. I love the humor and the relationships between the characters. Portia de Rossi is perfectly cast as the emotionless member of management. The 'commercials' for Veridian Dynamics are hysterical. I highly recommend this show!"}

To that end, the last episode made the whole season a worthwhile purchase ($15.00 Walmart, which had seasons 1-13 to my surprise). In Dances with Smurfs, Cartman, plays a Glenn Beck character doing the morning announcements (the kid who was doing the announcements was killed in a case of mistaken identity.) Cartman hounds Wendy, the school president, and blames her for every wrong at the school."}

They manage to mingle daily life with a magical world without being inappropriate.  Girls always love mermaids, and let's face it, don't you get tired of the Disney stuff?  This show, is free of all the canned laughter, corny old jokes, product placement, agendas and hidden messages that Disney (and most American TV) puts in all the kids shows nowadays.  It's nice to see a show the kids can just enjoy, learning gentle lessons about right and wrong, friendship and so on."}

Sometimes characters go in and out of episodes too much but perhaps that's necessary with such a large cast. (For example, Rikki's boyfriend Zane might be on episode 3 then you won't see him or that storyline till episode 7.)  I like that there is practically no bad language and violence to a minimum and that it focuses on good things like friendship, responsibility, loyalty etc.  My young kids and my teens like it and I do too, so thumbs up!!  My mom actually watched the show & recommended it to us since she liked it so well.  But remember, it is a teen drama...there will be corny moments...overall, 4 stars."}

It's one part &#34;The Office&#34; with it's mockumentary style along with the varied humor levels of 30 Rock.

If you are not an Amazon Prime Member and you are looking to rent this show (perhaps through a T.V. pass), I would recommend checking out Amazon Prime, as seasons 1-4 are available with the service in HD. Watch this show!!!"}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I like Parks and Recreation because of the format, how they signal out individual characters letting them share their comments on the current situation, which is a signature of The Office, whose writers created this show too. I also like how candid Leslie Knope's character is. Like other shows each character is known for a behavior of theirs, like April is snarky, Jerry gets picked on by everyone, and Chris is always optimistic. I began watching season three online, so thanks to Amazon Prime I can start from Season One. Since this is similar to the Office anyone who enjoys that show should try out this one. Another similar show is the Mindy Show in regards to a practice that she serves as a doctor for among other doctors. Both shows are about women in different professional fields and their trials and tribulations in being successful. Currently season six is on NBC and hopefully the series will enjoy more seasons."}

This is an awesome show and how a Cop show should be done--like The Shield--complicated people doing an unbeliveable job that most of us wouldn't do, getting shot at and crapped on emotionally by the public . The best character by far is Michael Cudlitz (\"Bull\" from Band of Brothers)the street Cop who has seen too much, done too much, has no life apart from his job and is spiraling out of control in his personal life. This guy has nailed every role he's had since 'BoB', he is great in my opinion. Regina King is also wonderful as the tough detective with a 'do nothing' partner played by Tom Everet Scott. The stories are really well done and I immediately bought season II half way thru watching this. If you are a fan of The Wire, Law & Order, you will love this show I guarantee it."}

The Unusuals is a refreshing and fun take on cop shows, and I enjoyed it, which is high praise since I find most cop shows dull and predictable, except for the wonderful British ones, like Foyle's War and Midsommer Murders and Death in Paradise.

She's rude, opinionated, with little patience for most people's problems.

But I digress; we're talking about season 2.)Season two is much like the other seasons - problems at home with with her mother and sister. And her partner, Marshall, being patient with Mary with all her quirks and irritations (it's obvious he's in love with her, but it's never explored).I would completely recommend that you buy this DVD set (and all of the seasons)."}

The diagrams and conclusions of experts in multiple fields of criminology is definitely a positive. It certainly doesn't resemble my usual military history documentaries!

However, the actor probably made a great decision choosing this role as it moves him away from \"Spy Kids\"-typecasting.  That's like the Harry Potter dude doing \"Equus.\"  Once the annoying character is no longer present, the film really gets good.This film is about \"creating a monster,\" in Frankenstein fashion.

We were introduced to some great new characters as well as a very interesting new story. Yet the show never was able to bring itself back to the impactful first season and NBC just decided to cit the chord. To me I am all about closure and not to give Heores a proper send off was terrible. I had heard there were plans for a 2 hour series finale made for TV movie, but it was scrapped. Either way as a whole Heroes was a very interesting take on the whole superhero theme and I am very glad to know that I was able to be a part of it."}

No fan of the DC Universe can safely continue to call themselves fans without seeing what would of happened if superman landed 8 hours later in earths rotation, thus landing in the USSR instead of the U.S.A. The ending of this tale also makes up for any of the small details one might quibble about when taking off stars. The only issue, which isn't much of an issue since it comes with the genre is that fact that the comics and \"in motion\" but are yet in still motion, while I've seen other \"motion\" comics with them putting the added effort of lip movement and believable motion amongst the characters."}

In season 2, the storyline gets more grittier, more dangerous for Dr. Lightman and his team as they confront liars who will do anything to cover up their lies. There's a hint of unrealism in season 2, only because civilians like LIghtman and his team hardly ever get called to go confront people in dangerous places such as Afghanistan or the site of a collapsed mine shaft where anything could blow up at any second. Psychologists like him and his team still realistically work under controlled conditions, either in their office or through videos and one-on-one interviews. Otherwise, though, season 2 is still exciting."}

The rest of the cast is alright but it is Roth who carries the film with his strutting and insights."}

The guest judge is very serious about his red wine so the two had to be perfect complements.  Amazing that there are this many super artistic ways to cook and present pork with red wine.  I just went and watched every back episode to this season as well and found them all fascinating.  Generally I don't like reality tv but these shows where you learn something are a bit different.

The plot is far fetched although familiar; of course I can't discuss that here. The resolution in the last episode seems rushed and somewhat unsatisfying as a result. Overall this is a fairly average British thriller in that it is extremely cynical and dark; it will not leave you jumping for joy and feeling spiritually renewed! I didn't enjoy this series anywhere near as much as Luther or Sherlock Holmes. Cumberbatch does as much with the script as he can - I understand what the script was trying to say but in this case it just wasn't especially convincing. Despite the criticism I did enjoy the series; I just felt it could've been so much more with a superior screen play."}

It takes a much darker approach than the rest of the Stargate series, which I really liked.  It didn't try to be funny, but instead focused on the classic questions and sense of wonder that make sci-fi great.For those who liked the cheesy jokes and two-dimensional characters of the other Stargate series, this probably isn't for you, which is most likely why it was so short-lived.  For those who tolerated the other series but prefer something with a little more depth and intelligence, then this is the Stargate series for you.I enjoyed the complexity of the characters, who could be both villains and heroes and still maintain the lead roles.  I also enjoyed the constant suspense, sense of exploration, and the quest for ultimate understanding that drove the plot.  I guess when it comes to intelligent sci-fi on TV, getting cancelled is just destiny."}

However, I'd like to point out a few things on the down side; 1- the murders are extremely grizzly with lots of blood and mutilated corpses at every episode, which is in sharp contrast to the supposedly peaceful villages where they occurred. 2 - The reasons that caused the villagers to murder others are very trivial and petty most of the time. 3 - The murderers are the most unlikely people; like an 80 years old woman who is a retired school teacher, an angel-faced 14 years old girl etc. people who have lived clean and decent lives in a nice peaceful village suddenly go berserk for some petty reason and start butchering their neighbors.So obviously the writers achieve their goal - it's just about impossible to guess who done it, but it made me feel let down in the end of every episode.Anyway, like I said - it is an enjoyable show never the less, just take off your thinking cap and enjoy the blood fest..."}

The Magnus character and her past-life husband are the most compelling characters; the others seem fairly one-sided caricatures.  The plot is based on a \"sanctuary\" developed to protect and study \"abnormals\"--those creatures with extraordinary powers and curses who could be compromised, exploited by scientists or other abnormals or creatures who pose a threat to the world.  While the premise is interesting, the stories often become sentimental and are verbally relayed rather than revealed through action.  Interesting concept but it needs much more depth, internal conflict, and complications to be compelling for viewers."}

He doesn't seem to have any chemistry with the women he was involved with, flirts with or tries to con. I have seen gay actors play straight men with much more conviction than he does."}

I suspect the player is the problem and not this set. Every time I start up the disc, it resets as if I had just placed it into the player and I have to go through all the front matter again. It is irritating because if the blu-ray player is on pause and shuts down for lack of activity, it resets the disc and we have to start over.Aside from that little problem, this is one great series, solving a new case each episode, and yet having an on-going story in the background. All of the performers are top-notch and the stories are all over the map, presenting a new look each story at some form of crime (white color or otherwise).

I am ok with suspending disbelief, but come on, suspending disbelief and suspending IQ aren't the same thing.  The woman is walking around playing clue games and someone is supposed to take this seriously, the fact that she is in serious jeopardy?  If this bit of boring dumb weren't the underpinning of so much of the show, it wouldn't have trashed the whole show, but it is and it does.P.S.

There were certainly contradictory remarks made by different 'associates' of Crawford, you were never sure if they were friend or foe.  Certainly interesting stories about her early days in Hollywood, but not a lot about her personal life.  Only one of her children commented on Joan as a mother, and she was one of the twins adopted later than Christina and Christopher.  Did the abuse occur?  I think it did.  I've seen and read the accounts of Crawford 'insiders' who were witnesses to what went on behind closed doors.

I also feel that, while the movie is a comedy, a lot of people should look at with just a bit of seriousness, as well, especially the 1st half of it.

Let's not forget Dunham is JNew W*rld Ord*r and his denigration of and overt racism for the White Christian and Muslim races is nothing short of criminal! You see what his race of people REALLY thinks about other races on the planet! His stuff is NOT funny and he's reached the end of his rope...perhaps he'll hang himself with it!"}

There is a terrible twist at the end of this movie,as the Husband who stayed with his wife are leaving town and he happens to pass by two of thefour people that held all three of them  captive.  I didn't know if this was a drama or a comedy.  I sincerely doubtI will ever watch this movie again because it was a really weird movie.  His mistress leaves and he stays with his wife andhas a baby together."}

The story was \"classic trek\" which should make any fan of the original television series more than pleased.  There were a few odd additions  (like the quirky relationship between Uhura and Spock, the fate of Spock's mother, and the ultimate demise of the Romulan villain) that didn't gel with what I remembered from the original, but hopefully if this remake kick-starts a new resurgence of sequels, these odd additions may evolve and/or be explained in later movies.Overall, this is an awesome remake amidst a dismal gallery of very bad ones in a variety of genres.  They got it so right... thank goodness!  Enjoy and of course, Live Long and Prosper!"}
{"label": 0, "raw": "How could I best describe D13-U? Not quite easy, despite being an easy viewing. Action-packed, yes. Quite funny at times. An interesting plot dealing with deception and political machinations (one of the few movies with that theme that I could actually understand it pretty well). Pretty well-balanced, at least in my opinion. And, overall, worth checking out.There's not much I could say about it that wouldn't ruin plot points and all, yet I didn't see the first movie, though I did enjoy how this one went.So, the best I could do is a recommendation: if you like fast action, a great-paced movie, a foreign film, numerous twists and deep thought to the twists, and realistic fight scenes, and an eventual cast of eccentric people (including a woman who knows how to fight with her hair as a deadly whip) in the mix and a surprise twist at the end, this could definitely be for you."}

It is a little more raunchy (especially the book) than I would prefer for a 13 year old.  But I would think a young woman at the end of high school or beginning of college might appreciate this level of teen angst.  The areas where the girls have to deal with heavy kissing and groping are the areas that I felt were a bit too much for my niece.  But it does not overpower the whole book.  I found the book and movie rather funny, and I think I will recommend it for her in a few years."}

George's inquisitive nature helps him form hypotheses and experiment to test each hypothesis.George lives with a man with a yellow hat (that's his brand). His character's ok, but GEORGE steals the show. Kids will love the bright colors and uptempo pace of the show.

The Yellow hat character and others are charming and the show is overall respectful and informative add on shows great respect and forgiveness for George. We love the reality segments as well. Curious George is just so darn cute and the show superbly done. The kids love it."}

Instead it just focuses on cool adventures with george.As an adult I find it interesting and tolerable (barney or dora being rather nauseating to watch). My kids 3 and 6 find it engrossing and entertaining. they also learn a few cool things each time, especially if i'm watching it with them and pointing out things here and there to stimulate discussion.This is on par with Wild Kratts (which is an awesome series as well), but I'm almost tempted to say it teaches even more than wild kratts."}

The added ability to stop and question and interact with your child to discuss what is happening to Curious George in his never ending ability to get into trouble because of his curiousity, is a common theme throughout.It provides a simple way to teach the consequences of not  understanding what might happen if one does not temper curiousity with caution :-)."}

A host of quirky characters with kinks that defy even advanced geometry, excellent art and animation, and scripts whose throwaway lines are better than most contemporary fiction are just some of the selling points.

The one star ratings on this are by people who don't understand what underwater 3d is about. IN fact 3d is often used just for depth and not for things coming out at you.  GET OVER THIS IDEA.  Jim carrey makes a whimsical narrator on this one and he's clearly enjoying his job!. The show like all modern nature shows gives a glimpse of the vanishing ocean vistas that man is destroying.  If you don't like short nature programs then don't buy imax blu ray shows. If you do this is a good underwater one.

He doesn't have to say much, his facial expressions tell it all. I've throughly enjoyed all the Foyle's War episodes. The plots are good and the actors are exceptional. The plots have a British slant and it's interesting to see the war from that point of view."}

My favorite scene shows the two men in Poirot's kitchen washing dishes.The second mystery involves several flights Poirot would rather not take, a blackmailer, and too many suspects with perfect alibis (\"I didn't know she was going to be murdered.\").The third mystery is a heady mixture of confusion when too many seemingly insignificant people are murdered.I can't get enough of these excellent productions.

Suchet makes the formerly somewhat stuffy Poirot, especially as depicted in old movies, not as endearing as he is in these Masterpiece Theatre creations which make you want to invite this little man into your home and watch his &#34;little gray cells&#34; go to work. The series just gets better and better. My third wish is that it could go on forever. it is so good."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I greatly admire Dame Agatha Christie and her wonderful work with the amateur detective genre but can take Poirot only in small doses. That being said, David Suchet and the wonderful actors in this series make it sparkle. I always think Suchet makes the obsessive-compulsive personality well-defined and am glad too that another wonderful actor Tony  Shaloub did the character in &#34;Monk&#34; that humanizes the condition. The realization that every person with such personality traits is not insufferable is nice. But Poirot's character really fits the period of the writing well and Suchet is brilliant. The episodes seem to me faithful to the stories and the era is captured with amazing detail in sets and wardrobe. It strikes me as a truly professional labor of love. I enjoy watching the series but this is a series where more than one episode at a sitting becomes cloying for me. I can appreciate it more in smaller doses."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This is the best made television out there. No American made show or series comes close. The dialogue, the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting, locations and cinematography and characters are top of the line. The staging is staggering in the first six seasons; the quality control falls off in some episodes later on. Perhaps because you get used to an exquisite product watching the first six seasons. Agatha Christie would be proud; maybe intimidated by the way her stories have been brought to life.  Every detail is spared no expense and continuity is unmatched. I can watch these over and over in spite of the fact that I know the ending and who the villain is. If you have never see a Poirot episode it&#8217;s well worth your time to watch. John Strickland is an excellent director and Suchet, and cast is top notch. With a cinematographer like Gavin Finney  casting by Susie Parriss, production design by  Jeff Tessler  and kudos to the entire production team, they are one of the best ever assembled."}

I enjoy this series immensely because the production companies involved in the creation of the programs seem to strive for perfection. The sets, locations and especially the costumes are superb. The episodes have only one weakness that I can see and that is the dialogue. On extremely rare occasions the characters will use an expression such as &#34;excuse me&#34; to indicate a hearing problem. This practice was not used in that time period for that reason. But I'm majoring in the minors here. All the Poirot programs are wonderful and I recommend them to everyone."}

This series must lead the pack in product placements. The view of Kellogg's, Ford, and many other product logos  was thrust into the viewer's face multiple times.  Did this technique make me want to run out and buy the product being pushed?  I think not. I quit watching commercial network television almost five years ago due to the number of commercials per segment, and the number of commercial segments per hour. Although there is really nothing I can do to avoid seeing the placements, I can let the manufacturer know that I find the ads leave me with a negative impression of that product by forcing the ad on me.  Unlike ads in newspapers and magazines I can't just look away and ignore the ad. When possible I purchase an item of similar utility from another seller."}

The episodes are poignant and brilliantly acted.The directing and cinematography are very good, particularly for a network television program. The writing is crisp and authentic. Each character has a unique, resounding voice. Flawed and genuine, we keep watching, wishing our family had the kind of resolve the Braverman's have.The abundance of characters allows a smooth shifting between each life, allowing more realistic events to provide entertainment, drama and comedy.

That any of these mysteries are part of illusionary compensation for losing someone is beyond belief. Also, to intermingle and confuse the one story line with another with an artificial good guy - bad guy - cute girl love triangle seems to be added to appease a certain viewing demographic but has no other function in this supposedly \"spine-tinglingly\" supernatural thriller.Finally, what does an eclipse have to do with the fundamental plot/story of the movie?"}

Jet Li did an excellent job in this gritty, dark film. this film concerned itself with brotherhood and love during the wars, and although I would rather have seen a more historic piece, the directors did use some of the historical facts in this movie. It was definitely worth the watch as it really tells a tale that sucks you in. 4 stars simply because brotherhood and love were more important to the story than the actual historical reasons behind the events of the period. This is an excellent film, however, and like so many Occidental movies that include some 'unsolved historical mystery', this one at least attempts to give an answer to the question. All in all, I would watch it again, and will recommend others watch it too."}

The realism is sometimes a bit \"raw\"--but accurate historically. Greeks loved beauty--Romans loved blood.The casting is excellent and the props superb! I first noticed Max Pirkis in \"Master and Commander\" (One of my favorite movies) and think the boy has a lot of talent.

Sadly, I would have liked for Caesar to have said that famous line in the last episode of this season.The few reviewers who say there is &#34;no rating&#34; must have missed the TV-MA square by each episode.

In contrast, the life of a simple soldier, Lucius Verena and his sidekick Titus Pullo live complicated lives in Rome as they try to return to civilian life after the Gallic Wars.

The switch between the two women (remaining nameless, no spoilers here) leads to a revised Pride and Prejudice holding delightful revelations about what customs mean and why they are important.

This blu-ray has some funny deleted scenes too and a bonus episode of the original Coon episode. If you're a South Park fan then this is a must have for your collection."}

The supposed 'highlight' involves a continuation of the Cruise theme involving other movie stars - all attempting to obtain Mohammad's supposed immunity from criticism. The sequel is lame, and heavily censored for obvious potential terrorism reasons. (It's a shame Comedy Central felt the need to censor that episode, but understandable given the times we live in.)

That being said, there are things in this movie that are more disgusting then the zombies being shot and people being eaten.  I am talking about people making lemonade and stirring the stuff with their hands.  I mean seriously, when you watch it and you will you will wonder the same thing.  It was actually more disturbing then the zombies eating people and zombies being shot.  It actually made me a little sick!  Regardless, good movie, decent acting, decent camera shots.  All in all a pretty solid 3.  Lots of cgi but it wasnt horrible."}

Little Bear is one those kids' shows that you don't feel guilty letting your young child watch - it has good language, endearing characters that appeal to young children, and good production values without over-loud music and garish colors.The language is clean, and the characters, i.e. Little Bear and friends, are truly endearing. My daughter loved watching the episodes when she was three. This is a good production for young children, and a value buy. Highly recommended!"}

The animation is as strange and intriguing as the picture on the front, with realistic over-sized faces attached to inadequate bodies. The main character's deadpan acting adds a sublime sense of resignation to this futuristic view of life under corporate control. How interesting that this viewing coincides with the corporate destruction taking place off the coast of my state in the Gulf of Mexico. Seeing the power of a huge corporation first hand makes Metropia seem all the more possible."}

The world is running out of oil and the Trexx Corporation has connected all the undergrounds, or subways, together into a gigantic network.  Roger (voiced by Vincent Gallo), a Stockholm call center worker, avoids the underground and blatantly, defiantly rides his bike to work.  Sometimes Roger hears voices in his head.  Roger soon discovers that Trexx and a vast consumerist conspiracy control his life down to the smallest detail.  With the help of beautiful super model Nina (voiced by Juliet Lewis), Roger attempts to break free.  An unusual animation technique manipulates real photographs.  This film, directed and co-written by Tarik Saleh reminds me of the best works of Terry Gilliam, Roy Anderson and others.  It's like a weird but lucid dream."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "A gray and dystopic future, evil megacorp taking over the world and the people in it - OK, that part's been done. 'Metropia' stands out for doing it brilliantly. It's a lot more than that, though.Animation has explored the super-realistic, with just enough success that the discrepancies become especially jarring. This goes farther, well into the surreal. That allows for exaggerations of faces and figures, wide-eyed blankness and evil scowls that wouldn't be phyiscally possible for human actors. And, despite great advances in computer-aided post-production, animators can build their worlds from the ground up in the image they want, with no need to retrofit them into scraps of reality. This movie really does use animation in a novel and very distinctive way.Very enjoyable in many ways. Certainly not one for the kiddies, it scarcely qualifies as as \"adult\" movie - but body-shy viewers might have trouble with brief- and semi-nudity.-- wiredweird"}

The new Doctor is okay, but lacks that emotional connection, and he is a little too nerdy but not as much as the 7th Doctor. I do wish the producers had explained who the time lord women was to the Doctor?  I know some people did not like how David Tennant Doctor said \"I'am Sorry\" to those he could not help, but I think that just showed his humanity, what was he suppose to say \"Oh well, just your luck\".

Yummy.But near the end of the movie, Ondine's secret is revealed, and it is a big letdown. I liked this movie better when it had a feeling of magic to it, and the truth just feels like a cheap cop-out, especially with the neatly-wrapped up ending.

Most of the negatiave reviews are from people that don't understand the concept and were to lazy to try to understand...or perhaps just trolling, big surprise.  The initial towers you can purchase shoot once.  As you earn more coins you can upgrade to better towers, power stations etc.  Anyways, the game looks simple in appearance, but again it's just a simple TD game for your phone.  The two things i don't like were the instructions didn't mention that you can upgrade during waves, not just between waves.  Also, I couldn't slide towers across my screen.  I could only move them by touching the spot on my screen where i'd want them.  This was tedious at times because the tip of your finger isn't as accurate as if you were using a stylus.  Sliding would have been much easier.  HTC Thunderbolt stock."}

The controls aren't perfect though. Placing the towers can be a little cumbersome in terms of fine tuning the location in a hurry.

In my opinion, the 1-star reviews are unwarranted, and should be reserved for apps that really should be avoided.As for the permissions, this one really doesn't have any to speak of, so that's definitely a plus!Is it worth $3?

Now, I will give the poor reviews credit, the developer assumes that you have already played the first version of this game, which is why there are few instructions.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I've played a lot of Sudoku apps, both on the Android and the iPad.  And so far, hands down, this is the best one.  I would have been willing to pick this one up for three bucks if I didn't already have it for free (yay, free Apps on Amazon).What I love about this more than the other apps is that you choose a number then the square you want to put it in.  Usually it is the opposite.  When you choose the number all the spots you've already chosen that number light up, making it easy to see if you are making a mistake or not.So, full marks for having something that is fun and challenging, giving a lot of options, and properly using all of the screen real estate to the best of its potential.  If you love Sudoku you HAVE to purchase this app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have had the free version for over a year now.  I never bought it because one puzzle a day is plenty for me.  I think I tried every sudoku option out there on the market a couple of weeks ago because I was seeing if there was something better but didn't find anything that offers all the features this one does.  Although I will say sometimes the hint system doesn't explain the strategy as well as I would like (When it teaches you what to look for).Oh, and I just found out its compatible with my Xoom...excellent!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This Android game is the best, smoothest, quickest sudoku game engine I've ever used.  It is better than any I've used in a browser or as a download game on my computer.It includes 3 tutorial lessons, and then 13 different skill levels.It compares your times to those of many other players to show you how you're doing, statistically.You can use \"Hint\" > \"Check Entries\" at any time without penalty --it won't respond with \"Everything is just fine,\" until you've entered all of the essential pencil marks-- or else you can take advantage of their graduated hint system or automatic pencil marks.You can also enter the given digits of a printed puzzle in order to solve it within this game.You don't have to have Internet access at the time you are playing:  you can play while your phone is in \"airplane mode\"."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Definitely grab this today if you have any interest in a sudoku app. There's plenty of them around, some that are free. But this one is by far the best i've used. I can't say that it's worth $3 for everyone, as i'm not personally a hardcore sudoku guy. But really, the tutorials really make this worth it. The hard puzzles are actually challenging. Theres no shortage of puzzles. The highlighting system rocks, as well as the best hinting system i've seen..I need a lot of hints ^_^ so I very much appreciate the attention to detail there. The main menu doesn't look like anything special, but the actual board is clean and clear. Nice job, and definitely worth the money for people who love sudoku. Enjoy!Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I play sudoku in a magazine and on my Kindle. 2 previous games were more tedious to use. One occassionally fouled up so that I couldn't even finish the game. This one has 2-3 options for how to use the pencil mark and guess for a square. It also has several helps, which I have an option to use or not at my preference. I do like the option for the software to tell me if there are errors and then if I want them fixed, I tell it to fix, but I don't have to. I also like that when I am working on 7's (for example) all of the sevens on the board are highlighted and all of the 7 pencil marks are also highlighted. This adds another level of testing for accuracy and guessing."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is very enjoyable and it can be very challenging. What I really like about It is that it helps a great deal in learning to play Sudoku correctly. There is a very good tutorial included.  I have only played the free game so far, but I am going to buy the paid version right now!! You should get this if you want to learn how to play the correct way, instead of guessing sometimes.  It is also pretty easy to understand. I have tried many of the Sudoku games out there, but this is by far the best!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really wanted to like this app. It works great on my Thunderbolt, the music is fine, the graphics are sweet and fluid, and the gameplay is all I had hoped for from a side scroller. The controls petty much killed it for me, though: no matter what you do, the ship lags behind where you tell it to go, and that means you don't shoot the targets, and you eat the incoming bullets.Trusting the life of my little ship and its crew to the accelerometer is as bad an idea as one would expect, but the only other option is to cloak your ship with your finger: an act that does little to hide you from the enemies, but does a fair job of obscuring your view, making this difficult and annoying to play. And at the end of the day, those at not words to describe a game that will keep me coming back for more. Which is sad, because it has everything else going for it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app contains 3 word games. However, as others have mentioned, there don't seem to be levels. Each game is scored, but high scores aren't saved anywhere. Also, unlike other word games, exiting the app ends the current game, rather than pausing it for later. That is my biggest concern. I like to go in and out of games over the course of days.As it is, it's ok for free. I wouldn't pay full price until they updated this app with some basic features."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "In this game you are given a grid of bubbles of various sizes which you must pop to clear the board. As each bubble is hit (with a satisfying POP!) it grows a size until finally it bursts, sending a blast to the nearest horizontal and vertical bubbles, which in turn causes them to grow. You are given a limited number hits, but as the bubbles burst they will do some of the popping for you.The trick is to figure out which bubbles to hit to cause a chain reaction of bubble popping splendor!A good time waster. You can solve bubble grid puzzles or play arcade mode to either get a high score or just to zone out on the pop pop popping.Minus one star simply because it can get dull doing nearly the same thing over and over, with no new challenges or rewards in higher levels."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've been trying to find out how to get in touch with the developer since I downloaded this app. It will record and save the conversation, but it WILL NOT PLAY BACK! I have even forwarded to myself in an email only to have an empty file arrive. I have done everything as instructed and verified that indeed there is a recording there that lists an amount of time, e.g. 3 minutes, 32 seconds, but it won't even start to play! How in the world do I get it to play back??"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I had downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire just to check it out and thought it was fairly decent.  It was about 2 weeks later when I was putting up a shelf and my actual level was not in the tool box or anywhere else I looked. Then I remembered I had this app and grabbed my Kindle, stood it on its side on top of the shelf, made the needed adjustment and secured it to the wall. Later that day when I finally came across my level, I double checked to see how accurate it turned out and it couldn't have been any more level than it was. I am impressed and although it may only come in handy once in a great while, it still is a very useful app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "So, I read the description and I'm psyched, right? Just what I'm looking for! Well, not quite.I always go through the reviews before installing. But I always download because I want to be ready to pounce. Even despite the reviews I was like, &quot;Huh, maybe it will still work.&quot;  My dissapointment set in when I went to install it and the permissions were far more reaching than the capabilities of not only the descriptions but the reviews.This app wants to read my messages? It wants to read my system log? Why? It wants unintrusive access to everything on my phone which, if it's replacing the Droid OS, I understand BUT when I look at the reviews and the full capabilities of the app it makes me extremely nervous. It's just this side of jailbreaking my phone as it is, no reason to invite trouble where it isn't needed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I feel this launcher is kind of the Winamp among media players. By default it isn't the most beautiful, but you can customize it to death.What I do like:- apps sorted alphabetically in a clear fashion- lots of themes- 5 way switching between homescreens,  would work nice with 5 screensWhat I don't care about:- the recent apps drawer with services and running apps- 5 homescreen. I don't need so many. So it kind of makes the 5 way switching useless- a gazillion themes.  It should look great by defaultWhat I dislike:- it's a lot more sluggish than go launcher ex or the default touching on my phone- themes are pricey. I don't want to pay more for a theme than for the app.- it looks low-def on my screen. And the ui has many inconsistent quality things.- lack of included widgets,  go launcher has great widgets"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "nice app, glad i got it while it was freex, but i still would have paid for it.if you want better reviews then go to the android market, most of the reviews give this app 5 stars, so i do not understand the negative reviews, those stupid people probably have a really crappy phone that cannot run anything and they are just whiny babies. i tell you the day the faotd has no 1 star reviews, is they day i win the lotto......come on amazon, change the age to be able to review."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Most of the time you get close to nothing for 'nothing' but this free little app actually does what you would expect it to do. It gets you police radio conversation (even comes with a 10-codes translator file). It lets you:- set alerts based no the number of people listening to a specific scanner- mark your own favorites- finds stations 'near you' based on your location- has a top-50 list based on the number of listeners- lets you browse by area (in 15 countries), genre and source- shows 'new additions'- at least on a tablet's large screen the ads are small and unobtrusiveOn my XOOM (Android 3.2) I am able to continue to listen to the police talk while running other tasks such as browsing the Web or writing emails.Good work. Recommended."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I never expected this scanner to be so great. I pick up police, fire, EMS, railroads.....from my area and from several different states as well. And the reception is super clear. I bought a scanner for a few hundred dollars last year and returned it - it was terrible. But this free app on my Kindle Fire picks up everything and all I have to do is type in a city name or county! Easy, fun and free. No trouble with installing it or using it at all.I highly recommend it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is amazing and FREE!! I could listen to this all night long. It picks up my local police station and you can't believe some of the stuff that goes on around town. The best time to listen to it is on weekends or holidays. It is very entertaining. Sometimes you just can't stop listening. Very addicting. There are complaints about it running down battery quickly, but I use this app on my kindle fire and it doesn't seem to use any more battery than any other open app. The other nice thing is that you can run this program in the background and still play other games or surf the Internet. I strongly urge you to give this app a try!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This free \"Scanner Radio\" app installed cleanly on my Kindle Fire HD and worked perfectly for my needs. The app does not turn your device into a radio but it does allow you to listen to Internet streaming of local government radio communications (police, EMS, etc). If your local service does not stream there communications, you will not be able to listen to them with this app.The interface was fairly easy to navigate and I was lucky to find that my local law enforcement's communication was available through the app.Recommended!CFH"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this app. It allows me to know what the sirens I hear are all about. I can hear the local police, emergency and fire traffic. I have been able to hear of incidents happening in my own neighborhood which allows me to feel safer. I know what is going on and where the troubled spots are and when. When I hear of breaking national news I can look for a frequency in the area effected and can listen to events as they happen. I had an old style scanner when my children were teens and loved hearing the goings on. Now scanners have gone high tech and are available over your computer, Kindle, and even smartphones."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I had to remove it as I found out that I live in a very dull city.  I guess that is really great!!  I waited and in an hour there were 2 contacts between the dispatcher and a patrol officer.  One about a lost dog and another about some trash.  Each was about 10 seconds.  It did kind of startle me when I heard it.  I thought it best just to remove it.  You may live in a city that has an interesting climate or you are a criminal and want to know when they are coming to your door but that is not me.  Try it you may need it or just enjoy hearing what happening!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "First let's make one thing clear. The application has NO control over what channels are available. The people rating it 1 star need to read.The scanner itself works great. It uses an online provider to get its data, which receives its data from individual enthusiasts.It is great to use for killing the time or listening to local events. It may be a data hog but there isn't really an easy way around it from a code point of view. Nonetheless, this application is worth the increased data use. If you have a wifi connection of unlimited data like myself there really is no reason to avoid downloading this application."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I just wanted to see if it works and it does. I took it off because I don't know if it might be illegal in this state as most everything probably is here. Have no use for it anyway. It works and can be adjusted to many different areas at least where I am located. I didn't know so many people were jabbering on the radio so much. I heard Fire, Police and a lot of unidentifiable jabber talk going on even late in the night. An old Ham or CB operator that knew the lingo would enjoy this thing. A friend of mine works in the Fire Department so I will have to find out if I can have this without cops going goofy on me somehow for some reason. Might be useful in an emergency?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is a lot of fun on a cell phone but it's even more fun to watch on your GoogleTV!! A lot of times when I have people over I'll put this app on in the background and we'll just socialize or have some drinks and every once in a while we hear some action that we get into. It's really cool as well that you can search the world for a city's radio to listen to. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is beucase on the free version, there are certain featuers that are lacking. i.e. you can't use the &#34;play/pause/stop&#34; button at the top of the screen unless you pay for it but you can still hit the back button and do the same thing if you want it to stop. :)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Who would have thought this app existed.  It's ok I guess, it really just depends on where you live and what you are looking to hear on this app.  I would listen in to be nosy and see what kind of 'action' was going on around the city; sometimes I will check out NYC or Chicago or whatever...also, we had some wildfires close to town this summer and I would listen in on the fire dept. channel at times to see if I heard anything the news wasn't putting out.  Many times when the channels get busy they overlap and it's hard to understand.  I have downloaded this on my Kindle and on my Samsung Blaze...both worked fine.  Cheap entertainment app. :)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was able to pick up my local police, fire, and ambulance.I always wanted to buy a real one of these, but they arevery hard to find anymore... plus, online, they are very expensive.So, this app is awesome!!!!!  I don't listen to it nearly enough.We always have tons of sirens going everywhere and alwayscurious as to what happened, but I don't use this that often.If I did, I know that I would satisfy my curiosity."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm fortunate to have RadioReference.com volunteers who broadcasting important feeds from my neighborhood.  My handheld transceiver has good range, but still doesn't pick up as much as the area police feed provided online.  Many areas I visit often have numerous feeds available, and is also helpful when I want to program frequencies into my transceiver.  I'm definitely planning on going Pro so I have access to more features, but the free version of this app is very feature rich and stable.  It does eat up the battery pretty quickly, even with earbuds, but I have plenty of adapters to keep my phone powered up.  I'm very pleased with the RadioReference.com Scanner Radio app, and heartily recommend it to an scanner enthusiast."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "3-25-13 -- I've always wanted a police scanner but they were too costly.  Kudos to the designer and to the volunteers who lend their scanners to provide this app.  The coverage of local police, fire and EMT service seems excellent, and the small ads are not too intrusive.  The site is very easy to navigate and a list of police codes is included.  There is even an archive if you want to review prior dates, but it requires a paid subscription so I haven't checked it out.  I find it hard to tear myself away from the live police chatter, even though it's usually quite routine.  Update 4-27-13 -- The alerts accurately tell you when there are more listeners than usual in a certain area.  Today I listened in on Australia loud and clear.  I'm impressed!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is another app that i cannot go without, I live in an area where we get fires, and this app is amazingly helpful, and i don't have to carry a scanner with me, all i have to do is start the app and select the channel and i'm listening just like that,this app does everything from citizen to fire and police and rescue channels, If you want to know what is going on around you but either don't own a scanner, or don't want to carry one this app is for you!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "For those that don't have a police scanner and like to make sure things are ok in your neighborhood this is the app for you. And hey its mobile and FREE!!!!  You just select your county and walah.....you have info for what's happening with the police, fire department,  and the EMT 's. And you will be the first to know of anyone you know is in trouble....going to jail,  being pulled over, accident,  and on and on. Enjoy it. Love You Love Nora"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I enjoy listning to police/fire/rescue frequencies from time to time but don't care to shell out for an actual factual scanner . Thought this would be an enjoyable option , which it was but alas my immediate region is not available to listen in on and lets face it , who wants to NOT hear whats going on in their neck of the woods ? I did enjoy listening in on some of the international frequencies it offered , Sydney Australia is a great one ! So for that alone it was worth it but don't be surprised if your preffered area isn't available since many of the places across the US weren't offered for listening ."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I am a weather head and like to check scanners where there has been a major weather related event.  This app is working just right for that.  I don't monitor local scanners for all police and emergency activity on a regular basis so I can't speak to that but I think it would be quite suitable.  Update - due to a large event in my area last weekend, I used the local scanner feeds and it was excellent - easy to locate what I wanted and switch between the main police and EMS feeds!  Audio was great, taking into account that scanner audio can be difficult.  Handy pop up of codes, too."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I originally had a Sony E-Reader, so Kindle was not an option but now I have a Lenovo K1 Ideapad and the app is available. While the Kindle app does have some good settings like highlighting a word to get the definition, font size and text, easy sync and great night mode. The formatting leaves a lot to be desired. Bundle books become one long book and all the books I have read have yet to have an option of jumping or returning to a page or chapter. Which come to think of it I have not actually read a book with page numbers, just percent of how much of the book has been read. The free books and having them linked to my Amazon account are a plus but the formatting takes this app from great to just okay."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have used this app on both desktop and android and would rate it as &#34;functional, but nothing to write home about. Had to remove it from my phone, but that was because of RAM problems, not the app itself. It does have a few cool &#34;sister&#34; apps that are separate apps working in conjunction w/ it, but the app itself is about what you would expect. May very well work better on the Kindle hardware, but I don't see the point in purchasing a tablet when I have a smart phone, a laptop, and 2 desktops already. I personally prefer Adobe Digital Editions and the Nook apps (Barnes & Noble), but mostly just because I am more familiar, having used them both first, and I actually would rather have a paper book than any of them. If you need a decent reader app, this one is just as good as the next, so go ahead and try it out, just make sure to comparison shop."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As an e-reader this app is the Cadillac ( not Rolls) of the bunch. Great content, ease of use, etc.BUT it is not a home library substitute. I feel like it was written by a geek who own two books. I have to go into the PC kindle to find a cookbook or a sifi novel or a computer book and then search the title on the tablet to find the book to read.Your programmers need to talk to that librarian that told them to be quiet in the library when they were eight.If I can't find it, I can't read it.Even the new Fire HD doesn't have collections.  WE CAN'T SHELVE OUR BOOK - FIX IT NOW"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really love this app. I purchased a polaroid android tablet . There was no reader installed. There were so many to choose from, I didn't have a clue where to start. Now, I'm no geek, so it had to be easy. I figured I'd try the android Kindle because it came standard in so many e-readers it would likely be easy to figure out. Turns out--I was right. I love it. It's so easy to operate my kids can do it. Even I can do it. Bookmark my page and pick up where I left off with no hassle. Now I can use my tablet for what I bought it for--a portable library. It's so easy to go to amazon, find my book, download it and read. The selection is great, and the prices are way better than say-- driving to a big bookseller to search for and buy a paper ( save the trees) book."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Used to I had to cart 5 or 6 books with me on trips and if I really liked them I had to bring them back with me. With this Kindle for Android app I can have as many books as I want, read them all and buy more. I love books, but this is so space friendly! I no longer need to worry about space, weight, or running out of books. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I often find typos; sometimes reversals, or combining groups of words, missing words, but you can still read and understand the stories."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a OK app.  I mean it doesn't do that much.  It surely doesn't have all the features a Kindle reader has.  One day they will upgrade it more so it has more features but in reality Amazon wants you to buy a real Kindle, and not use an app.  Well I did and I gave the real Kindle away.  I got a Samsung Note 2 and that is all I need along with this app.  I am not going to run around with several different devices and the Note 2 does everything and does it well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "It's an eReader app for books you've bought from Amazon, which I'm. sure you already know. For that purpose it works. It could definitely be better though.Amazon needs to sync personal documents as well as purchased books. If this is a mobile platform for my books why can't all my books come over? Some may point out that personal documents have delivery fees, but that is only using Amazon's 3G and this app uses our networks. Also, why not let us target our app instead of or along with our Kindle? This would require us to be given a unique @Kindle.com email address, but it could work.I also want the app to sync highlighted notes / clippings from when I read on my Kindle.Finally, I want to be able to highlight and share quotes from my clippings like on my Kindle.This app works, but not better than Aldiko and definitely not better than a real Kindle."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Will NOT launch AT ALL unless wifi connection is available. Had the app for about a month now. I can disable wifi (to save battery usage) after launching, but operation is significantly slower with eBooks already saved on device. The only thing this Kindle app does is download a giant list of arbitrary 'recommended' and 'best seller' cover pics that I have no interest in and cannot disable. All I wanted to do is read books from  a car or a park bench, for which this app is COMPLETELY worthless. Might as well stick to paper books. S#!*EDIT: Installed on an Android 4.0 device, and STILL won't launch, or even connect to kindle store."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "There should be support for reading books download from another source, as well as the ability to use a local dictionary (e.g. ColorDict). The ability to add support for lookup in user defined wikis would be great too.Highlighting text spanning more than one page can be difficult or impossible.  Regarding selection of text, is being able to copy a sentence no more than a few times a day such a problem for publishers? This would be useful for quoting books.Otherwise this app is the best reader I've used, though the first point makes it necessary to have another reader installed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "i originally downloaded this from Android Marketplace. I loved the ease of reading e books with this app so much that I got a Kindle as well for the extra features. It gives me the best of everything. I am never without a book now but have no more piles of books all over. The sync between Android &amp; Kindle works flawlessly for me. Books can be archived online so I can go back &amp; read again. This is great for me because I love series fiction and sometimes forget things before the next book comes out. There is some content you can't get with the app you can with Kindle. I think maybe Amazon wants to keep a few things out of the app so people still buy Kindles. Something else that makes having both worthwhile is that Kindle is totally non glare so you can read outside but not backlit (which is easier on the eyes) while my phone has backlight so I can read in dark/dim light."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Originally got this for my knock-off IPad (called YourPad) and it worked fine for a while, then got glitchy and wouldn't open the book.  Tried removing & reinstalling, however that didn't work.  Got out the CHEAPER knock-off (iBridge), installed Kindle for Android and it has worked PERFECTLY ever since (knock on wood).  I love that I can take my current reading material ANYWHERE and read while I'm waiting at the Drs office or whereever.  Not my favorite app, but probably the most used one."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "While I can still see more on a big screen, the Android app has a feature I've been hoping for forever and it's not on the computer app.  It tells me how much I have to read in a chapter.When I'm reading, after I finish a chapter, I'd like to know how long the next chapter is so I can decide whether to read it or put it down. Easy in a book. Impossible on the Kindle without messing up my forward progress.Now it tells me how much is left in the chapter at the bottom of each page.It says it in minutes rather than pages. I'm not sure why. Pages make more sense, but it say it, and that works beautifully."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Why on Earth did Amazon have to change the app?  By far, my most used App, Kindle for Android was as easy to use as the Kindle.  Now, I have to select the home tab to get to my books.  When I open the app, I'm opening to read. . .  not have suggestions shoved down my throat.  Amazon, you already have my business; please let me have my Kindle for Android app back.  Or, could you at least give me the option to not have selections glaring at me when I open the app?This was a 5 star app until the most recent update.  I understand that most people probably like the changes but how about considering those of us who don't?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this application.

I always have my phone and therefore I always have a book!Thank you Thank You Thank you!highly recommend downloading this and giving it a shot.My favorite thing:Putting my baby down to sleep I have to keep the room silent, and dark. I like to hang around when he goes to bed because hes teething and wakes up in pain fairly often. when I put him to sleep, I roll over and whip out my phone and read a book on my phone until Im tired, its like stealing some adult time and still being an attentive mom!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "To access your kindle books on an android tablet, this is the best way to do it. It's a little more cumbersome to get your books off the cloud, but once downloaded to your android (Galaxy tablet in my case), this works out just fine. On the Asus and Dell Windows 8.1 tablets (which are actually PCs), it's even more difficult to access the cloud for previously purchased books. I won't take any stars away for that, but only because there may be an easier way and I'm new to Win8 tablets. (Aren't we all?) Considering how many android apps there are, however, I am at a point where I can say that Android is far easier to deal with vis a vis Kindle and apps in general."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is the one app that I use daily and has changed the way I read books.  I am the type of person that always has a book nearby and the Kindle app allows me to carry multiple titles in a very small package.  I went to Italy with several books loaded and it was nice to be able to read on the plane, tour bus, etc. without the weight of a book in my hand.  The app is very easy to use and I like the new updates; books are easy to find on the carousel.  This is the first app I loaded when I had to change phones recently... couldn't imagine my phone without it.  Even my 82 y.o. mother has gotten into the swing with her new phone.  She rarely makes calls but loves to have a book close at hand!"}

Installed nook and converted my books to epub with calibre.

I was a bit concerned as I had read from several reviewers that it didn't work on &#34;older&#34; androids. It is fine for my Samsung Galaxy 3. I enjoy the ability of reading in my fire at  home and yet have the ability to read when I'm out and have some free time. It sync's wonderfully and I'm very pleased with it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I never planned on buying e-books, I was more than happy just using a print book. That just changed, I received an Android tablet (10.7 inch) for my birthday in January, and didn't do much with it until recently. I was in Amazon App store to download a timer for poker when I came across the Kindle app. So I downloaded that as well, while looking to order a new book from one of my favorite authors, I noticed that he had written several short stories for the Kindle only. I ordered the stories, and was delighted with the ease of operation in downloading to the tablet, the ease in reading while in bed, on the couch, room lights on or off. I am definitely a believer in e-books now. I still like print books for the beach and pool, but the Kindle is great for the other times that weather is not an issue for electronics. Definitely recommend this to all the readers out there."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have a Kindle Fire and I take it with me everywhere I go.  Occasionally, it will run out of battery at a very inconvenient time and I have been able to transition over to continue on my phone very smoothly.Once, horrors, I actually thought the Kindle was in my purse, only to arrive at a restaurant on my own, intending to eat and read, to discover I did not have my Kindle with me.  I was able to move right onto the Kindle app on my Droid and be completely happy.It is a well arranged app - and while not a Kindle, it definitely does the job very, very well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've had the Kindle app on my EVO phone since last November, about ten minutes after I got the phone. The app works smoothly, and I've had no problems with it at all. I enjoy having some books with me on my phone; it's surprising how often I read something using the Kindle app on my phone when I'm waiting for an appointment somewhere. I still carry and use my Kindle 3, but this app has turned my phone into a very handy supplement to the Kindle. Syncing to the \"furthest location read\" between and among my Kindle-equipped devices has always been easy and accurate."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Why??? Runs horribly now even on a dual core and is literally 10 times larger than a year ago and for what? Please, please stop this and optimize this app!!!! I hate giving it one star but there is no excuse for this. And WHY do you store the book data in the app/system space instead of of user/sdcard storage space? AND when one deletes (archives) a book, why doesn't the app remove it from local storage? Why are these very basic housekeeping functions and storage decisions so poorly implemented? :("}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I don't know where I'd be without both my Kindle and my new Kindle Fire!  I bought my first Kindle when I had my shoulder op. Wow,  how have I ever managed without it? But be WARNED,  if you start a library,  make sure you keep your old email address and password if you decide to change your email address to a new one.  Libraries are not transferable.  I DID NOT KNOW THAT!  Now I have two libraries. Something Amazon needs to work on. Just sayin'"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have tried almost every sync app out there for android.  My criteria are that it must sync ratings both ways, work with smart play lists in iTunes, sync play counts, and be user friendly.  I found nothing else even close to this app.  I use the WiFi sync add-on with this. I once had a problem with a non US phone, and the developers fixed the problem immediately.  Very responsive.  Bought it here in Amazon because the other market doesn't work when I travel...  No complaints after almost 1 year."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I must admit to HIGH frustration when I first download it and couldn't get it to transfer playlists -- only the songs -- which would have made it useless because you can transfer songs for free without an app with just a USB.  Even restored Kindle to new condition and tried again. Customer service was prompt in responding and suggested I download their (free) music player and use that one instead of Amazon's.  Worked like a charm and now this is JUST what I needed.  Maybe I missed it, but never saw that piece of advice in my installation instructions, so I would recommend they add that so people like me don't get confused (I'm pretty tech savvy too, so if I didn't get it, I'm sure others would benefit from that bit of info!).  Still I'm happy enough to go from 1 star to FIVE stars.  They got it right!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I listen to several hours of podcasts each week on my aging iPod Nano 2nd generation plugged into one of my stereo systems. I figured I could save the cost of upgrading to a newer iPod by just copying podcasts from my iTunes library to my new KFHD8.9. I couldn't find any easy way to do this until December 28, 2012 when Amazon featured iSyncr at a discount and so caught my attention. I purchased it and it turned out to be exactly what I needed. I did have to experiment with various settings to finally understand the terminology and to adjust the options to my liking. I prefer syncing over USB because the syncing control panel on the PC is more understandable to me and easier to use than the panel on the KFHD. Now, any time I update my podcasts in iTunes on my desktop PC I am just a few clicks away from having everything synced for listening on my KFHD."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app wouldn't download my songs to my 16gig SD card reliably, and when it did, it was epic fail. It &lt;&lt;NEVER>> imported all my music even though I checked carefully to ensure I hadn't gone over the level. It may have been something I am doing wrong, but I doubt it. The app asks you where you want the stuff loaded to, then arbitrarily decides where to load the stuff to. Save your time and money. I'm looking for a better solution, and in the meantime, I'm doing this the old-fashioned way. Hey! CDs!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Alot more apps have been release of late, but this was one of the first radio apps that I got to pick up international or US based internet radio stations. I wish the search option was better.  Maybe if hashtags were incorporated, it would help.  I don't like the fact that you have to pay for that.  The free version does the trick if you know what you are looking for.  Otherwise you might get a bunch of stations that you need to listen through before you get to what you really want.  The buffering is a bit bad.  I'd get alot of dropped signals when listening to stations in the gym.  Not sure if that is an app issue or the station stream."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I can say that this is one of the best radio apps that I've used.  There are tons of different radio stations for your listening pleasure.  You are guaranteed to find something that you like. It's a quality app that I have had no issues with. Also, If you're worried about permissions, just email the developer or go to their website.  The developer is very responsive, which is rare sometimes, with other developers.  Also those sticky intents permissiosn is not only on this app, it's on other apps as well - especially apps that have an alarm function, such as this one.  At $4, this app is a deal. Pandora is $36 per year (with no ads)."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "xiialive is a great player for SHOUTcast streams.When I searched the GENRE section, I immediately found a great station that I'd never heard of before.The equalizer works pretty well on my Kindle HD7. I use a CUSTOM setting.It does have a couple of desirable features that are not easy to find, if you don't hold it right.Bitrate selection requires holding my tablet in portrait orientation and looking for the android-standard menu on the pull-down buttons.It is not Pandora and it isn't RealPlayer, so there are several internet radio sources that it can't play, but that doesn't mean it is the worst player out there.It just means that it won't play streams that aren't SHOUTcast streams, duh.And I finally found out how to close the player.Press the STOP button, first, and then exit the app with the BACK arrow."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "UI is very refined and easily usable.  There are so many channels that it's going to take a long time to listen to them all.  Plenty of choices for everyone.The audio queues for connection and disconnection are nice when you don't have the screen on and wonder why your music stopped playing.  Doesn't seem related to the application at all because some of the channels were flawless and others disconnected quite a bit.  (Mostly those from across the world like Ukraine).Good app, thanks for picking a good one this time Amazon."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This program is outstanding.  I like music and got this so I can hear Music as I use my tablet.  I just typed Japan in the search feature (No reason I could have type Ethiopia but I was not sure of the spelling!) and a list of Japanese listening language) channels appeared.  I selected one and BAM (Like the Chef!) Japanese music started to play like I was there on the Island of Fukuoka in the city of Saga.  I wonder what they were saying during the commercials?  I highly recommend this program."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "It's an all right radio player, and there are several out there to try. I tried several radio stations and all of them came in clearly, no problem. I do wish the controls were a little more intuitive, especially when looking for a station. I had to really dig just to find Top 40, which is what I listen to most... as do most people. Also, I wish I could search by location as I'd rather listen to something local or from a specific country. No major complaints, but nothing about this blew me away either. If you are looking for Internet radio, try the trial first before dropping upwards of five dollars on this."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Best radio app! Was wonderful on my phone, works beautifully on my tablet as well.Very large selection of Christian stations, which is sooo hard to find on most apps (sadly). Feature PACKED! Has customizable sleep timer, alarms to wake to any station, favorites, backup, bluetooth, search...and on and on. Can't find any flaws, nothing missing here! Got as a FAOTD, but one of the select few really worth paying for. Nice UI as well. If  you're looking for an all-around radio app, this is it!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is okay. I've only listened to a couple of stations and they're not quite what I expected, especially for a paid app.I tried the Irish Pub station and was really expecting more pub like music. Not everything I listened to was really what I would define as &quot;pub&quot; music, which I would define as something you'd hear at an Irish session.I also tried the Wacken station because I thought it'd have a decent selection of heavy metal. I haven't had time to listen it a lot, but I thought the Pogues was an interesting choice for a metal channel.Anyways, these seem like random Internet channels and I'm entirely convinced that all of them are good. Maybe it's just what I'm into. I'll play around with it more and see where it ends up."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I liked it right after I downloaded it. I liked it when I was playing around with it. Easy to use and maneuver. Had problems connecting to a lot of stations. Had problems triong to figure out how to stop it and exit out of the app completely. I just ended up pausing it ans leaving it paused, until the middle of the night. It unpaused and scared me half to death, beings it was close to my head. I paused again and set it down. It unpaused once more. I, then, decided to uninstall  it. Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is another solid internet radio app with a gorgeous interface. My favorite radio apps are iHeart and Tunein for local radio. Xiialive has a wider variety of radio stations not found on either iHeart or Tunein. I searched for some of my favorite local stations I use in the other 2 apps and they are not available in xiialive.So instead of using xiialive to replace the other 2 which is what I had hoped it looks like it will compliment the other two apps.UPDATE: This is the FASTEST radio internet app I have used. I don't know how the devs did it but unlike the other internet radio apps you usually have to deal with the connection first then the buffering of the audio. With xiialive I have NOT encountered any buffering or connection issues. Playback is nearly instantaneous. I tried it from a range of radio stations from around the world including different genres and as soon as I selected the station the audio appeared."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Very enjoyable app.  Have listened to it for a few months before giving it a review.  As the days have progressed, it has gradually replaced my shortwave and hd radios with more stations to choose from and no need to play the antenna dance.Works great on the k-fire original.  Can run all day if the battery is fully charged.  I find new, enjoyable, unexpected stations almost every day.  Good sound.The only problem occurs when I fastforward too quickly through my list of saved stations.  The programme freezes.  Just restart your device and remember to wait until the station is fully buffered before moving to another channel and you'll be back to business as usual.Well worth the purchase price.  Give it a try."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is fun game worth the download.  It is free after all.  Very low-budget look to it but still fun.  Inconsistent as far as how challenging the levels are but not a huge deal.  For example, I will blow through like 10 levels in 5 minutes but then randomly get stuck on one for forever.  And then after that one a bunch more easy ones.  To me the game seems to easy but I still play it.  And it still gets 5 stars from me."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I played all the levels and didn't find that there was any bias to the computer rolling more doubles than myself....also, I only consider myself to be a slightly above average player and find it rather easy to beat the computer at level 5.  So either I'm a better player than I think I am or the game's AI  could stand a little improvement. That said, the game is an enjoyable time killer and seems to work flawlessly without any bugs or glitches.  The operation and animation is smooth and the controls are quite easy to use on even the smallest screened smartphone.  I'll be keeping this one in my game apps....at least until I find something better."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I miss playing backgammon and this is a nice way to be able to play when I can't find a partner.  I enjoy playing and winning, so I just use the easier levels.  Occasionally the CPU will get some strange runs of doubles but looking at the stats shows that it is not that bad.  For people really wanting a challenge, I would suggest using a high difficultly level.  It makes some pretty stupid moves, like moving pieces in the home area to a better take off position while there are still pieces outside of the home area.  But maybe the harder difficultly level corrects that."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I loved backgammon as a  young woman of the 80's, so I figured I'd download this and take a trip down memory lane.  Well, for the life of me, I couldn't remember how to play.  So the first stop was the help button and within a few minutes, it all came back  to me.  Whether I play the game with my husband or with the computer, it's a great way to  pass some time.  This game is easy on the eyes and the ads won't hinder your gameplay."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is an excellent version of backgammon.  Very easy to play or undo your moves.  Although, sometimes it really looks like the CPU is cheating, I do not believe it does.  I have beat this game so many more times than I have lost and I have played at level 4, a lot.  Plus, I have played many other backgammon computer games &amp; none compare to this one.  The higher the level the more the CPU uses classic strategy moves and it also hits your piece more, but that goes with any good board game.  All things considered this is a worth while game to down load and purchase."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I just loaded the checkers app by this developer and loved it so went looking for more apps by them and found backgammon.  Years ago I used to play daily and entered public tournaments (we were not elite players - just players who were obsessed with backgammon).  However I have not played a lot recently and am not familiar with all the online games or other apps.  I played the app at the most difficult setting and found it worked well and was fun to play.  The app works like a full tablet sized app on my ASUS Transformer tablet.  This app looks good (not as richly colored as checkers but still nice), the pieces move smoothly (no lagging), and the board lights potential moves.  Nice app in my opinion!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "One of the best free apps out there. There are enough customizable options to make everyone happy. You have to work at it to lose on easy. On the hardest level, a win is a victory and the dice always roll in favor of the computer.  It is great that it has a 2 player option that you can use to pass it back and forth for live play. Best of all, it has a great interface that doesn't make you work hard to figure out how to play the darn thing!  The graphics are nice as well.  The free version is ad supported but they the ads aren't annoying and don't interfere with game play."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Overall I think this is a good game. I agree with other comments about how it seems the computer gets more doubles than I, but the handy built in stats screen shows that both players get on average the same number of doubles. What I find annoying is that the computer seems to get more favourable rolls than I do. That is to say that I seem to sit on the bench longer if a guy is captured than the computer does. Ifyour losing to poorly though you can undo and change your moves knowing you both will still get the same rolls.  Like I said I like it overall, and for free who am I to complain?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have tried several backgammon games and this is the best by far!!!!!!!!!  No questions asked, don't even bothering trying any others.  If you own any Apple products and want a good backgammon game, I feel sorry for you because Apple doesn't have this version.  All of their version can't compare.  There are a lot of comments about this game cheating, I don't have that problem and I beat the game frequently on the most advanced level. Love the speednof the game too."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I bought this for my fire. It was free :-) Now, I can't seem to put it down. I may have to soon, though, because I am playing the game at its highest level, and I am starting to win more often than not.A note: the game seems to give more doubles and favorable rolls to the opponent. The makers assure that the random number generator is really random, and they even offer a roll-your-own option for dice. But doesn't it always seem that you are getting worse rolls when you are losing. (Probably why you are losing).The two player feature would be a good option for plane trips and the like, when you don't want to risk loosing pieces."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Nice little word search game. My mom always plays this type of game. It doesn't take a big time investment, but she likes finding all the words and the color themes makes it more visually interesting. Just slide your finger across the screen to highlight your word.  You can pick the word categories you want to work with or make up your own. You can even add your own words. I played it for about 20 minutes and it seemed very easy. I think it would be best for kids or senior citizens. Works well on Kindle Fire."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a faithful and realistic implementation of a familiar board game.  I enjoy board games that I can play against the computer.  (I'm not into online games, or playing with others who I don't even know.  And I usually only have a very limited amount of time to play a game, so it has to be on my time, and whenever I like.)  This version of Backgammon plays a good game -- but not the kind where you will be beaten every time you play.  (I hate computer chess games, for example.)  Of course, it's still a game of change; your success depends, to a great extent, on the &#34;roll of the dice&#34; -- literally. But in this case, that roll seems pretty fair.  And with some careful playing, I tend to win more games than I lose -- which is fine with me."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This review is for the free version.  Very nicely done implementation of backgammon, with fast and elegant interface, nice user controls, and good documentation.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the computer opponent seems to follow a flawed strategy with its end game in that it doesn't try to get its pieces off the board as soon as possible.  Also it seems slow to double when the game is winning and quick to accept doubles when I'm winning.  All in all, it's just challenging enough for me to make it interesting at level 5.As for the random dice generator, I don't agree that the computer cheats, but it doesn't seem to have a true uniform distribution (where each of the six sides of each die is equally likely).  In one of my first dozen games it gave me the same roll three turns in a row, and it does seem to roll an awful lot of doubles."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The dice appear to be driven off a pre-seeded prng, since you can undo multiple rolls and then get exactly the same rolls again. That isn't technically buggy and they can legitimately claim to get a flat distribution over time, but it means players can cheat and therefore so can the computer.Secondly, the AI is defective. It's even worse than one I would write! That really REALLY needs fixing. Badly. It seems to have a lookahead of zero and a penchant for stacking everything on the last space. Either write a better AI (herustics, not fixed moves) or let it write its own (genetic algorithms)."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Backgammon is all about doubling and probable rolls of the dice...This is fast and great play.  A well designed app on my KFire.

{"label": 1, "raw": "This is the world's all time leading cheater.  I have been playing backgammon for over 60yrs,  more than 1,000,000 games at least.  Statistics show that if you leave a spire open this app will hit you 90 / percent of the time. If you play this game as much as I do you know the statistical average is around  35 percent.  And wait until you get to a roll off,  count on the machine getting 3-4 doubles. They even have a disclaimer telling you why they are not cheating. This game is no fun.Grampyz"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like the Backgammon app, but there are a few things that are quite annoying.  For example, when you roll doubles, you have no option to move two pieces at a time.  You have to make 4 separate moves, with each move involving at least 2 clicks.  that's 8 clicks for one move, which is too many.  Also, I started playing against the computer, with the difficulty set at 2.  Even though it's not the lowest setting, the computer played like a complete novice, passing up obvious moves in favor of idiotic ones.  Of course, this can be solved by simply setting the game at a higher difficulty, but it was still annoying.  I'll be looking for fixes in updates, so I haven't given up hope that this could become an outstanding app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I played Colossal Cave (a.k.a. \"Adventure\") when it was first developed, back in the 1970s.  At the time, it was one of the most fascinating computer games available.  And its long life -- and the fact that I'm playing it again almost 40 years later -- support the fact that this is the greatest adventure game of all time.  There is a fascination with something that at first appears so simple, yet without \"awesome graphics\" or \"3-D whiz bangs\" or any other \"modern gaming devices\", and is still challenging and enjoyable.The game is implemented well, and I highly recommend it -- especially to younger players (by which I include anyone under about 35!) -- as a wonderful break from the fast and furious trigger-finger mindless destruction games that are so prevalent today."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is for those who are old enough to remember playing Colossal Cave Adventure (ADVENT) way back in the old days.  These days, graphics in games are the norm.  If you want an experience that's different than all the third-person shooters, then try this out.  It's very basic with its vocabulary, but if you can manage to get into it, it's a very enjoyable and very vivid adventure because the graphics are all in your head.  It's one of the best relics of interactive fiction.  Infocom games started out soon after this and are very similar.  It's a lot like Zork I, but a little different."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm assuming this application is a work in progress, as there are currently an odd mix of restaurants. The major places are covered of course, along with some various other places I'm not familiar with. If the dev continues to add to this list, it could prove to be a very extensive resource!The ability to sort by macronutrient or name is very cool. Good idea.The inclusion of some of the chain restaurants that aren't fast food would be very nice. I see applebees is there so it looks to be in the works.A utility in the program to request restaurants to add or even reference sources such as a url or something to make it easier for the dev to find and add more places would be icing on the cake.Cool application. I hope to see it grow.  For the health conscious out there, it's a no brainer on this free day!  (Thanks Amazon!)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "It does give you calories (and four other facts) for the items you'll find on the menu but it only gives you four and you can't put it all together.  For instance, if you look at Chipotle on the app, you can see the beans and the rice and everything's nutritional facts but unless you're writing it all down and adding it all up, you have no general idea of the nutritional facts of the burrito you're about to eat.  And by \"nutritional facts\" I mean fat, protein, calories, fiber, and carbs since that's all they give you.  Glad I didn't pay for it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This dev can do much better - check the features for the iPhone version. I concur with the critical reviews this has been getting.  This has a decent # of restaurants and the ability to sort by various fields (calories, etc.), but definitely needs way more. It doesn't actually count anything; you can't change menu items to subtract items like mayo(which many websites do); there's no real size selection; it is missing key details like saturated fat, sodium, & sugar; other reviews have noted inaccuracies & that it is out of date on some items; needs app 2 sd card; it should also have a \"favorites\" option for restaurants & menu items for quick look-up. Clearly an app like this is much-needed, but this doesn't fill the void. Other reviewers suggested My Fitness Pal, Calorie Counter & MyNetDiary apps; I'm going to check them out."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The app does what it says and it has a decent number of popular fast food chains. However, it is certainly not worth $2.99 for a few reasons.Pros: Easy to pick icon driven restaurant chooser. No ads.Cons: Only has 71 restaurants. Once you select the restaurant you get a basic menu driven list like most other apps. Only displays calories, fat, carbs, fiber and protein. So there is no report of saturated fat, vitamins, or other useful info. It only displays one item at a time, so adding up a meal would be a very arduous process that would require pen, paper, and probably a calculator. I could actually go on and on.Summary: Basically, there are a lot of other apps that do a better job, provide more information, are more useful, easier to use, and all around higher quality."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "First you're restricted to the restaurants it has listed (no Red Robin for example). If you do choose from the list you don't get to choose sizes. If you happen to get the only size, it still doesn't count for you, it's just a lookup.Ultimately that's what this app is, a simple online menu lookup for some restaurants with only one size and no descriptions.There is a search feature, but really it's just a filter, you can't search across menus for instance.The first free app of the day where I'm sad that even though it was free to me Amazon is paying the dev 1/5th list price. Sorry Amazon."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I expected a lot more. Not sure if thats because other calorie counting apps have set the bar so high, or because this one is just that bad. The list of restaurants is extremely short. The app doesn't look like anything special, considering the dev's want money for it. It lacks so many features, features that every other app of this category have. There should be some sense of customizing meals. Even if they didn't go above and beyond, selecting 1 standard size for each item is ridiculous. Some of these fast food sites even let you build your meal and see the totals. Honestly, this is a poor excuse for a calorie counting app. Don't waste your time.Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Everyone else is right - this app is pretty bad. Almost every single one of these restaurants already has this information on their web sites, and most of those allow you to build a meal so that you can actually COUNT calories.This app is also sorely lacking in food and restaurants. The Arby's Angus Three Cheese and Bacon is missing, and I've been seeing commercials for that for several weeks now. Plus the restaurant Zaxby's isn't listed at all.Honestly this would be tolerable were this a free app, it really wouldn't be worth. 99, but frankly for the dev to charge 3 bucks for this is just downright insulting."}

(KFire)  I also dislike that extra 5 of a kind cannot be counted as a score for a full house.iI give it 2 stars because the actual gameplay is pretty quick.Going to uninstall to see if I can't find one I like better,  or at least one that doesn't have gameplay functions literally on top of ad links.  I got a FAR better Yahtzi game on a CD out of a cereal box!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I used to play Yahtzee when I was younger and this game is just like it.  Works great on the Kindle Fire, I've had no problems with the app.  I wish it had multi player capability but my wife plays it on her Fire and I play on mine and we compare scores.  I like the features of being able to move an item places in case you tap the wrong field.  The color change in the options is nice but it will sometime revert back to the original color then change to the color scheme you selected.Overall it's a fun app if you like playing Yahtzee."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this game because I  like the game yachtzee, but it is missing the excitement of actually rolling the dice. I also miss having an opponent. The sound effects are ok. What I do like is the quickness of each game. It is helpful too when it gives you hints about where to put your score. Makes for less thinking. I can whip out game after game, but it takes away from enjoyment. It's a good game to play if you are just trying to pass a few minutes of time. Glad it was free."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Just downloaded and installed. I was amazed at how fast this app installed, I expected it to take longer because of the incredibly detailed images. All views are gorgeous on the Kindle Fire. Took me a couple of seconds to figure out how to get back to the view I wanted, but now that I have it figured out, I'm having no problems navigating around the app. Well worth the price. The only thing that doesn't seem to work on the Kindle Fire is the \"keep Earth stable as device is rotated.\" Although it could be that I don't understand that feature."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have the parking lot game,different development team, that would play on my phone and tablet. Unforantly the graphics were poor on the ten inch screen. The author of this game did a great job on improving the graphics in this version.  Ironically my phone is a Droid Razr so per the developer's comments, I can only play this on my tablet and play the other version on my phone. Overall it is great game regardless of the eye candy and I highly recommend it for all ages. (Toshiba Thrive 3.2.1)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a very fun way to waist (spend) time. As far as all the worry about datamining? If your playing on a Kindle Fire, as I am what data can they get? Also if your worried just disable Internet access before starting the game.  Believe me, it is well worth any small effort just to play this game.  To all you yelling about this being a copy of other games like Blockme,,, almost every game is a copy of the one that came before it.  It's called innovation or improvement.  Paranoia is sometimes a good thing but this is just a game and an easy workaround for any phone users.  I would readily put this as one of the most brain teasing and fun games on Amazon.  jmho"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "So when was the last time you walked out of the supermarket and your car was stuck between 3 BMWs, 2 limos and 4 SUVs that all look exactly the same and you had to go and move the cars around and not only that, but the exit HAS to be RIGHT in front of the car, because apparantly your car cant turn, but it apparently can deny physics by sliding left and right with no turning? No? Maybe if you are God. This seems to be a puzzle game for God, as it is nothing we humans can relate to.Would be better if it were a bit more realistic and put blocks or a host of other things than cars.If you are God and can relate to this, then its not a bad game, but very simple and has no depth. Special abilities, new mechanics, etc."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Well, I played 40+ puzzles, I guess it can't be bad. You might almost call it addicting. :-) It is a decent puzzle game, but somehow it feels a bit overdone. Can a game be too flashy or frilly?Regardless, this game will keep you occupied. I haven't played any of the other traffic puzzle games to give an accurate comparison. But, if you like puzzles or puzzle games you won't be disappointed getting this one as Free App of the Day. Whether it's worth paying for compared to the free alternatives, I can't say."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Although I got this free on Amazons Free App of the Day, I would gladly pay the buck for this many puzzles! The game is certainly fun &amp; addicting, no bones about it.I especially appreciated its thorough game settings &amp; instructions on how to play in the Menu. Many game apps lack this, making it difficult to play them.For those asking why &quot;the permissions&quot;? It's for sharing of your high scores online,  IF you chose to do so.If you like strategy type game puzzles then, I recommend giving this one a try."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Just the right age group it was made for. My son is 2 and loves learning about the colors and numbers at the same time. I love that it has puzzle fruit, counting how many fruits go into the lunchbox, plus he's learning his small to biggest, and even his color groups. May not be a lot to some people, but it makes a little difference to a little person that loves learning everyday. I love this game for him and I have seen that he is learning a lot everyday."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is an almost perfect preschooler game. The screens are high definition, colorful and the animation is well done. The point of the game is to complete a set of three challenges in order to be rewarded with the child's choice of a sticker. Then repeat. The challenges range from counting to matching colors or fruits to a simple puzzle to memory games. They rotate randomly. All the while a cute little monkey dances on the screen when your child is successful.It is easy enough for my 2yr old and captivating enough for my 5yr old. It works well on all my devices from Thunderbolt to Galaxy Tab to Bionic.Well worth the cost."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This program consists of about six single-screen puzzles, each with a few variations.  After about 10 minutes of play they begin to repeat.  As you move through the games there is no escalation in difficulty or any apparent attempt to select the \"next\" puzzle based on previous puzzles or the child's success at solving them.In our case my 4-year old daughter got bored even before the first sequence was completed.  A little ways after the puzzles began to repeat she closed the app and wanted to watch a movie.On the plus side, this app is \"solid\" (no bugs and with a finished appearance).  It also does *not* need any kind of Internet connection to run.  (Some reviewers said it did and I expect they may have been using an earlier version.)  Finally, it runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.In summary, it is good for at least one fairly short sitting."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this app when it was free, but it is definitely worth the $2 asking price. Interface is pretty solid, colors are bright, voices are annoying; all the things that hold a child's attention. I feel this does a good job of teaching simple shapes, colors, and counting.Basically this is a collection of mini games for your little one. Every few mini games, it rewards you with a sticker, which you paste on a wall and immediately go back to mini games. Shape puzzles are smooth and easy for my three year old, counting is maybe a little automated as it doesn't encourage you to follow along as it counts when you tap the fruits. It is educational until your little angel can count to 20 on his or her own, but even then it's entertaining and anything that buys me an extra ten minutes of peace at the grocery store check-out is worth two bucks!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I picked this one up for my kids to learn touch gestures on the XOOM tablet.  Both my 3 year old and 5 year old enjoy it.  It has a few different game modes (find the biggest/smallest, drag to complete a puzzle, place stickers, find all objects of the same color, counting, and a small memory-type game).I haven't had any technical issues with it on my Thunderbolt or XOOM.  Hopefully a future update will bring a broader set of objects and games (I'm worried that the kids will tire of the small set of images and sounds)."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "5 year old grandaughter who will start kindergarten liked this app for several days and it kept her busy for part of a long aiplane flight. It was a bit on the easy side for her and she has since gone on to other apps.There are other reviews that tell exactly what this app does.  It can be a nice fun learning opportunity for a child.Grandaughter does like earning the stickers!UPDATE:  2 year old triplets first time on my phone. Not everything was mastered the first time, but they loved this app!!Update:  After using this probably twice a week for 6 weeks or so, the triplets have totally mastered this.  While they still enjoy it for a short time, they are moving on to other apps.  Would love suggestions for suitable apps to try."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Out of all the things I have put on my Kindle this is by far the best.  A fellow teacher had her son and mother-in-law with her at school one day.  My grandson is the same age as her son.  We were talking about apps and games for our three-year-olds.  Her mother-in-law recommended this game.  I got it for my grandsons (both age 3) to play when visiting. After my son saw it he purchased it for his son.  It is educational, fun and they learn to play it as they go.  This should be a must on every tablet, computer or other device if you have preschoolers."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "One of my grandkids is a big Curious George fan so I had to give this game a try and cannot help but compare to theJumpstart Preschool 1 Free - Preschool Educational Appgames.  What I like about these games are that they help with counting skills and matching games that the Jumpstart games do not provide.  In addition, the puzzle game in Monkey Preschool is much easier to pick up; in the Jumpstart puzzle game you are allowed to pile puzzle pieces on top of each other and on top of the pattern so that key clues are covered.  With the Monkey Preschool, the pieces snap back to the pickup pile and do not become piled up so all the pieces are out in the open and easy to compare with the pattern.  Although the Jumpstart games are a lot of fun, the Monkey Preschool games have an overall edge in ease of learning the concepts and in the breadth of skills."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "Coolest ghost app ever! It is real too, I was sitting in my bean bag chair and I had it on, my little sister had spilled chips on the floor, the ghost radar said robot, which freaked me out because we have an electronic robot that cleans, and it was on. It also said stepped, and as I was going to tell my mom, I stepped in the chips! Another experience I had, I was on the couch, and my mom said to my baby sister, oh I need to change you! I had the radar on and it said, diaper and stink, and my sister stunk! So, if you believe in ghosts, get it! If you don't maybe you will! This is a 100 star worthy app!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "From what ive heard, these ghost word generators can be eerily accurate, which may be a sign of true paranormal activity. It could just be plain cooincidence too. Either way, ask your friends about personal ouija board experiences. Using Ouija boards have been reported to cause anything from hauntings to possesion, and honestly what is a ouija board but cardboard with numbers and letters drawn on it? My point is, using things for the intent of talking to otherworldly creatures might bring trouble your way...especialy on a computer program like this. Also, the battery life issues are probably just the program using alot of power, but ghosts reportedly drain battery power, so it could be a sign of true activity if the power gets low while getting accurate word hits."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I always enjoy watching Ghost Adventures and The Dead Files so downloaded this free for the fun of using it. When my son used it he got some action and a few words so he enjoyed playing with it. When I used it nothing, but still one of those things that is fun to pull out when you are bored to waste a little time. We have not tried it outside the home. I would like to point out that even the expert ghost hunters don't get action everytime they do a lockdown at a location so just have fun with it!"}

I'm a truck driver and i downloaded this app while i was sitting in a shop parking lot. the first thing it said was parts. then it said p and kept putting the letter p across yeah i really had to bad. i went to find an mt trailer and it said flat and research. didn't. find a flat but when i checked inside trailer i found a huge hole in the roof. if I'm to believe what they say there were a few ghosts around too. I do believe in ghost but i'll have to do a little more researching to see if this is really a reliable ghost detector. all in all it is an interesting app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this, and it was talking away. I don't know if it is real but some things it says are just too relevant. Get it and try and see what you think. I got this one and liked it so much I moved on to the $1.99 upgrade and I am very pleased with all the extras it has. I still use this one. My friends are really interested to see it. This version is easy to use. I said some things after I asked a question, and they were right on the money. Creeepy!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this app after looking at other people's reviews. I am a total believer when it comes to spirits. According to the radar, I had like 6 ghosts in my house. They started saying stuff that didn't make sense. But seeing those words and looking at the radar scared the s*** out of me. Because I'm a believer, this scared me so badly, I'm afraid to use it again. The only reason I want to use it still is so I can maybe communicate with my dad. Only 4 stars because it's so freaky."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I immediately turned on this app once I downloaded it. I believe in spirits. Plus... STOP CALLING THEM GHOSTS! I don't know why, but I feel like I'm disrespecting them when I call them ghosts. So I call them spirits. Anyway...A red dot showed up at the very top of the screen. It looked like it was pointing at the house across our street. Then, it said &quot;MARK&quot;. That freaked me out, because a few years ago, a guy named Mark used to live in that house."}

I had just gotten out of the shower, talking to my husband, naked I might add, and the word \"Beautiful\" came up. Now I could flatter myself and think it was talking about me but I just brushed it off then I had to give my husband Insulin, 2 shots which he doesn't like very well and was grumbly about it, when I was through I looked at my Kindle and another word popped up, \"Necessary\" Coincidence?

But I like to think that it may be a spirit attached to an antique that we may have. I honestly think that that would be really awesome but I'm not getting much clues because the only words I got where pink, shelf, automobile, soldier was a good one and my first one i also got fourth, fellow, and some other bland words."}

I quickly got bored with it and deleted it. Afterwards, I was persuaded to actually BUYING the other version of Ghost Radar, which was supposedly &quot;better.&quot; Sure, it was a little cooler. You could go back and forth from the classic radar and an activity waves line graph. It also &quot;translated the ghosts messages to you,&quot; which I actually believed for a while. But don't believe a word of it, people. The radar does not &quot;sense&quot; anything. If you want an app that you can just use for fun, go ahead. But it does NOT sense ghosts. Just saying whaylt your gut is screaming."}

I screamed and showed my sister. Another thing happened when my friend, whose grandmother had passed earlier, was wearing a necklace her grandma had given her.

I am a believer in ghosts, but a severe skeptic of this app.  Every now and then it'll creep you out by spouting relevant words and dots in relevant locations, but at least 75% of it appears to be random or void of energy spikes.  Anyone who takes this app too seriously is gullible and anyone who dismisses it completely is joyless.  It delivers fun and entertainment to believers and skeptics alike and should be used solely for entertainment."}

Here's what it did to me one time: I was on my kindle fire on the couch, and it said &quot;wind&quot;. I thought it meant something, so I went to the weather channel.

{"label": 1, "raw": "You know why you can't get it on Kindle Fire? It doesn't have a camera, and all devices you can download on do. It utilizes the camera without you knowing, and it identifies the object and says the word. This explains why it needs so much information- it wires to the camera. I didn't realize this until I read you couldn't get it on the fire and it uses a lot of info. If you don't beleive me, you don't, but an app can't utilize 1,000-5,000 dollar equipment."}

Have some fun with it, try to figure out why it does what it does, mess with minds of believers if you wish. But learn to have fun, not be critical when uncalled for,  and don't complain about a program you didn't have to install anyway. Most enjoy showing how easy it is to replicate the goofy stuff on TV. That is fun. Some people like to have fun and be mock serious, just as some of you like to carry on to get a reaction. Stop flaming and REALLY PAY ATTENTION to what they say. IF the program is excessive in battery usage, that's a claim to consider. Most of the other stuff is petty. Others having problems with this program draining battery?"}

I allowed him to try and speak with her,  a red dot appeared and the word Giant and My was said.  too many on point coincidences for me.  I say it is worth the download if you are curious.

{"label": 1, "raw": "This would be great for kids at a slumber party or for really naive adults who believe every speck of dust in a picture is an orb.I bought the free version and I liked it well enough and then I bought the paid version which is no different from the free version in any noticeable way.With the paid version, it's almost as though it is setup to shoot out random words and phrases at a certain interval. Maybe they thought people would get their moneys worth that way to give people who paid for it more fake excitement? It seems that way to me.If you're into the paranormal, I would download the free version just if you're curious but don't buy the paid version. The free version is better, in my opinion.Don't expect this to be a serious tool--it's just a toy."}

I searched out many spirits, most of whom became fast friends (well, some of them were a bit decayed and they weren't so fast).My issues began after my recent demise in a construction accident. I wound up in a number of pieces. It can be quite challenging to keep track of all of them. This application does an adequate job of finding the big pieces like my legs but isn't sensitive enough for my fingers and nose. Since the little pieces are the ones that usually get lost, this is a serious drawback."}

I thought about ice cream just to mess with the train of thoughts, and it gave back DAIRY,  followed by COLD afterwards.Then it hit me. I am a ghost.It took some remembering, but i died years back in a car accident, and i had been in denial this whole time.Thanks to this app, i was able to realize that i had passed on, and finally cross over. well. not yet. i am writing this before i finally rest. :)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Thanks to this app I found out that my house is haunted.While I was working on my computer I fired this app up having no idea what to expect. I clicked on the \"Radar\" button and it showed 3 blue dots to my right, and 2 yellow ones in front of me. Then my phone says, \"Ignore\". I figure it's telling me to ignore the dots. (Which I assume were ghosts)?Then my phone starts popping off word after word. Are these ghosts having a conversation? It seemed like all nonsensical words. Well after a couple of minutes of this I said aloud, \"Go away ghosts, I'm trying to work here!\"Suddenly the radar went blank and for the next 20 minutes not another word came out of my phone. I finished my work and turned the app off.Freaky Man!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app unleashes the previously undocumented hardware in every Android device to communicate with the dead. This came in practical use I was able to find the ghost of my dead uncle and he directed me to where he buried his money- it would have been lost forever- or worse found by staff of the camp for disadvantaged children on who's land it was hidden.I also use this app to make sure the bathroom is clear before I take a shower or \"do my business.\" I really don't want ghosts of dead relatives watching me in there. It's kind on creepy when you think about it- now, no more worries!I might buy a 2nd phone just to keep this app on all the time."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm loving the negative  comments from &quot;experts.&quot; M.D.s don't get mad about the x-ray apps, so why are you mad about this?Most of the comments have shown that people aren't REALLY taking this seriously, so why are you?Lighten up. This is a fun app to have for Halloween.By the way, if you could provide proof that your custom home-made equipment works better than this app, I'm sure we'd all love to see it. No, I didn't think so."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got the game after reading the reviews and thought it would be fun just to try it even though I was pretty certain it was bogus.  A part of me sorta hoped that my little brother would find some way to communicate with me even though I know the kindle doesn't have a microphone. See he killed himself last July and I miss him so badly. Anyways, I started the game and walked around and got some random words like question and paragraph. I got bored and sat on the couch. Not much happened after that so I figured it needed movement so I started shaking it. Soon words came popping out but I froze when the word brother came up. The next word was beside. I kid you not! I couldn't help tearing up even though it was probably just random words that happened to sync up. Nothing interesting after that but it shook me a little."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "At first but it &quot;told&quot; me a lot of things that noone would know about. I turned it on this morning and one of the first things it said was, &quot;court&quot; holy cow!! My husband is in court this morning !! How would a simple app know my husband was in court??? I didn't download this until late last night, long after we were discusing his case. It also mentioned several other things that noone knew about let alone what seemed to be a cheesy app - believe me its not. It works. I even got 3 different names of spirits that may be here. Yes, we have A LOT of paranormal activity here.Yes I do believe in ghosts, I did before the app but this app is making me even more of a believer!!!What's even freakier is that I had gotten this app from getjar for free, the exact same app as this free app of the day and its free on Amazon today. I downloaded it late last night."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "I had this app on during a severe wind storm. I happened to look outside &amp; noticed a tree down in my backyard. I forgot about the app, leaving it on as I went outside &amp; for the next 3 hours, took a chain saw to the tree, trying to clean up the mess. When I got done &amp; back inside, I picked up the kindle, noticing the words recorded the whole time I was outside. Not only was my first name there, Ellen, but the words, danger, branches, noise, storm, tree, wind, emergency. There was no one in the house the whole time I was outside, nor had I called anyone and no one called me"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "there was a ghost in the room, we could feel its presence so I turned this app on and it confirmed that there were actually five ghosts in the room. My uncle is a professional ghost hunter who removes ghosts. He normally uses seventy thousand dollar worth of equipment, including a quantum flux integrator which he designed himself, he says this app is better than all of his equipment, and makes his fancy stuff obsolete. My uncle says if you have ghosts, you should call him, he will remove the ghosts for a small fee. Mom says he's a charlatan. I don't know what that word means but I'm sure it's something nice."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was willing to overlook certain things and believe in this app because I really wanted to. but it became really obvious it was stealing info when it started giving me words from my anthropology lecture that I had read a few hours earlier.  words like sister, brother, century etc. would have been interesting if their origin wasn't so aparent. then i got that odd name evreryone talks about on here ..(brownyn?.) and knew for sure this is fake. so the word part is crap, but id like to still believe the blips on the radar have some meaning!?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "as soon as I turned it on, I pointed it at my uncle Griswald and the words serial killer appeared on the screen.  Right then and there I knew app was a fake . My uncle Grizzly is so mild mannered and wouldn't hurt a fly. I told him how it called him a serial killer and he just laughed and laughed...and laughed..Then he said, be a good nephew and to put the duct tape,rope and hatchet in the trunk of his car because we are going for a little ride. OH BOY, I HOPE WE ARE GOING TO DAIRY QUEEN."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "okay so I just got this app for my kindle. I figured it would be some sort of gag thing but now I'm freaking out. I got bored so I said outloud what word am I spelling; p-e-t-e-r. it said a bunch of random words for a while so I turned off my kindle. about five minutes larger I checked it again and the list of words it had said was seven. one of then was Peter!!!!!!!!!! I'm freaking out!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The title says it all. The reason I didn't give it a better score was not because of what it is or what is was supposed to be or do. It was just for fun.  It was because of the way it worked. It used way to much system resources and was nearly impossible to turn off. On more than one occasion I had thought I had turned it off only to find it still running in the background. I couldn't find any setting to shut it off on exit. I had to use the app killer installed in order to close it. Quite annoying."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I purchased this app because I had always heard my friends talk about how on several occasions they had used it and had gotten spooked by it. Well after using it myself several times. The words it revealed did not make much sense to me. Last night while I was sitting reading a book, It said the words sit, book, and  drink. On the side of my chair I had a glass of tea. It gave me the creeps, I felt like I was being watched! I recommend this app to everyone or anyone that has ever doubted that their is such a thing as spiritual presence living among us."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app was cute/silly as a Halloween joke/toy, but I can't believe anyone would believe in what is 'says' or that anyone would pay for it [I got it as Amazon's Free App Of The Day]. Every few seconds it 'says' random words, and keeps a list of them, which you're supposed to believe are being said by ghosts/spirits. While I believe in ghosts, I don't believe in this app. It was fun for about 10-15 minutes before I uninstalled it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I wasnt having much luck in finding ghosts, as I live in a new house in Greenwich Village in San Francisco, so I got bored and started playing around with the settings.All of a sudden, the thing just lit up like crazy! I screamed because at first I thought I was surrounded by ghosts, but then my neighbor 'roommates' Ace and Gary came running over to see what was wrong and the scope was pointing right at them! Thats when I realised I had changed the setting from 'ghost' to 'fairy'.Now I can't go into a Starbucks without the thing pinging off the charts."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "ok, so I downloaded the FREE version and received some pretty interesting stuff. it words like funny, author, look, letter, william and lastly concerned. here's the scoop, my dog Astinos has something going on with his skin that I've been concerned about. I've got student loan ugly face letters that I'm avoiding opening like the plague, I do write pretty funny texts to my friends daily, and as for William...I'm clueless. Some of this is, you'll pardon the pun, dead on but hell, creepiest thing is the digital voice. What do the different colored dots mean? One showed up blue with a red circle around it. If my phone rings right now I'm gonna pee my pants. Get this app. It's fun to me."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is so much fun for me and I like to use it everywhere. Restaurants, while in line anywhere, outside, peoples houses, in the car (as a passenger only), pshh, I like to bring out my ghost radar everywhere. It has given me words that were creepily accurate. Recommend it for any paranormal lover or for people who are into this sort of thing. Of course when I tell friends, family, and strangers about it they laugh, roll their eyes, and try to tell me it's just hooplah but they shan't take away my joy that the ghost radar provides me. Don't expect a million ghosts all at once giving you tons of words. Just give it some time and they'll show up give words at 'their' own pace. This is the first app I ever downloaded when I got a smartphone, so it will always be special to me ;)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Such a cool app! While I was driving on the highway it said \"driving\". So many interesting words and full of ghosts outside, but not in our house pitifully.I will have to drag my tablet outside and have some fun listening to the words :DEdit: Ok, I have to edit my review. The app did detect a ghost inside. It said: Johnatan, sick, rest, care, lake, (At that time I stood up and moved away) Next words were move, come, hide and so on. At the same time, I heard two loud bangs in the bathtub.....spooky"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded Ghost Radar Classic (free)first. I got such a kick out of it that I splurged ($.99) and bought Ghost Radar. I have freaked out my 18-year-old daughter, and friends. Sometimes it spouts off words that make you go \"hummm.\" For instance I had it running (on my KFire) one morning as I was getting ready for work. I walked out into the hallway where one of my cats was sitting and suddenly the radar said \"feed\". Yes indeed the cat was waiting for me to feed him.Most of the time it says things that don't make much sense but I get a kick out of it just the same. Yes, I am easily amused. :)"}

Love it...great timing for halloween. Don't let it creap you out it's just entertainment. Laugh a little. Keep the cool reviews commingled...oh...wait...incomming...message : Whatever you do give it your all...except when you are giving blood. hahahaha{^_-}"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this as the free app of the day from Amazon today.  I am glad I didn't pay any real money for this as this is like a \"Rick Roll\" type app which doesn't really do anything productive.  It was obviously meant to promote Sean Austin's music career.This app would be useful to people who want ideas to start their own music careers by picking a strange catchy name for your developer name and disguising it as something else such as a party gag type app.I agree with the many other reviewers that the reviews for this app are rather funny and entertaining.  Therefore, I am giving it 2 stars just because it gets people wanting to discuss their app purchases on Amazon."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is awesome. ghosts are real. the last words it gave me were; hurried, Columbus, New York, directly, and audience. I was standing next to an Adam Dunn poster (white sox) and if you haven't noticed, those words fit in perfectly. even though Adam Dunn isn't dead, it could have also been another baseball player or someone related to him. This Is Real. don't believe the bad reveiws. Wait hang on, new words; look, up, danger....AAAAAAHHHHHHH!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "When I did manage to get a word or two accepted, the game was over, and an ad would pop up for another app, and then I had to accept or push another \"button\" to go back to the game. The game seems to be enjoyable, but nothing would happen when I tried to select a letter. I tapped; I tried sliding the letter; I just pushed on the letter. It worked about 10% of the time.I tried the app twice. However, it was much more trouble than it was worth and I deleted it from my Kindle Fire...twice."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app gives you a string of letters and about 30 seconds to make as many words as you can.  Then it moves on to another string of letters.  I find some sets easy, and others challenging, but I have always been able to think of at least one word for any set.  Even with the easy sets, I have to think fast to get a three-letter word, four-letter word, and so on, before it changes sets.It's great for when I'm not sure how much time I'll have to play because I can quit a game any time.  This is a must-have app for Wordies.  No problems loading on mySamsung Galaxy Tab, it doesn't hang up, and there are no intrusive ads."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Gave it a high rating as it's free and does more than i thought it would for free. Alot of free app's are just that free, you open and u can't use most of the features cause thay want a fee to do so. This one is simple to use and move around in. Streaming live TV, news vid's, news articles, my stocks watch list, and alot more. Sometimes with a weaker connection u can't load vids or watch live TV. but everything else loads well on weak signals. I recommend this app to all."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Having this information available on your phone in a timely and effective manner, almost as it happens, is a fine example of the best of the information age and what it means to all of us.  Whether you're an investor or not simply isn't the point really.  The information available here drives the quality of all of our lives.  And its in your hand with this app and well done at that.  Some may not like that it doesn't rotate the display but the info on offer simply doesn't present well in any other format then potrait mode.  If you're interested at all in what is really going on in the world this app is one piece you should have available."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've used this App for many months on my original Droid and again on the Kindle Fire.  This is easily one of the best apps I've found in the Android Market.  Perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to view signal strength of all nearby access points on a nice chart listing all of the available channels, making it very easy to see when two or more access points are interfering with each other, and demonstrating which channels would be available for use to reduce such interference in the future."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "What can I say other than it works like a charm! Open it up and, if you have the graph selected, you can see all the wireless signals in the area, centered on its channel, and the height of the peak corresponds to signal strength. Walk around the house to see how the signal strength changes. Surprisingly, there were several more signals - about 3X as many than shown on my phone or laptop - picked up by this app.  I installed a wireless extender and was able to optimize its location using Wireless Analyzer. There's a lot more it can do, but this alone has me sold!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I read the issues of freezing and people downloading it, and then having to remove it for different reasons. I give an app of this type time to see what it can do for finding those access points known as hot spots. I can follow the readings ok, but I too wish it had a free adds version available. Maybe that was going to be for this offering of an WiFi analyzer from this company. Test and use over time will tell, if this app is worth keeping on the Kindle Fire HD Tablet. I will give it a try, and I will keep searching for others to have a possible back up of the same type app available for my Kindle Fire HD. I think the multitude of resources like the guide books and manuals help one know what is true or works true to use."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this app onto my Kindle Fire, started it up and it immediately displayed the closest wireless networks to me and I was able to identify the most congested channels around. I logged into my wireless router and switched to an unused channel and my Kindle Fire connectivity improved tremendously. My Roku connection which was listed as \"poor\" also shot up immediately to \"excellent\". Now my connections just fly and my wireless router no longer drops every few days the way it had been. I also walked through the house and discovered even more networks near to me that had been impacting my bandwidth. This is an excellent application and I wholeheartedly recommend it. You don't have to be a geek to use the app, btw. It's simple to use as it offers multiple graphical views which in turn makes it easy to understand the information displayed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is reason enough to get an Android device.  The information it provides regarding channel usage on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands is essential if you want to set up devices and wifi routers for the best possible performance.  Sure, you can get fancier products from Fluke and others, but if you go that route you'll pay hundreds of dollars and have more junk to tote around.For most Android apps there are several functional alternatives.  Wifi Analyzer stands alone.The associated Wifi Connector Library is useful if you want one-click sign-ons to different networks."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I usually know where the hot spots are in my neighborhood, and I sure know where there are no networks on my hikes, but this analyzer told me when I was having problems with connectivity in my home office. I started \"losing strength\" a couple of nights ago (the bars went from 5 to 1) and, with a business network account, this just shouldn't happen. But I used the Wi-Fi Analyzer and sure enough, mine was one of the weakest of six networks in the area. Then I noticed a pattern: always weaker at night. Last night, I had to \"reinstall\" the connection, and today it was confirmed by my provider that they've been having problems. The Wi-Fi Analyzer got me a one-month credit! (Results may vary: I've been with the same provider for 5 years.)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Another (Must have) for Kindle Fire users. This one has like 5 setting to check out  just about all you need on your wi-fi.. One has a meter thats great to see where are all the Hot Spots at around the house.. You can even add a beep to it do drive everyone nuts!, beep!!!  beep!, lol. Fallow my \"review list\" here on amazine to find out whats the Best that other Kindle Fire users are useing. Thats all I put on my list.. Nothing but the best for you.. Enjoy all."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I added this to my Kindle apps to test my WiFi since I had never used this feature of my router (I've only used wired connections so far). The router was on the floor about 50 feet and two walls away from the big screen TV where I wanted to stream Netflix videos in HiDef through the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". It turned out my signal was a little weak at that end of the house. By simply raising the router to eye-level in the room where it is installed I increased the signal substantially. I've also used this to find and measure open WiFi networks accessible on my Kindle from parking lots where I was waiting for my wife to finish shopping. It's a useful and interesting tool. WiFi analytics Tool also works, but I preferred the displays on this app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was always getting spotty wifi at the outer reaches of my house.  this app helped me see that I was sharing the same channel with three other routers.  selecting a channel that wasn't so crouded really helped.I wish there was a indicator explaining that some of the higher channels are for international use and may not currently be enabled on the device running the app. I accidently set my router to one and didn't realize it and spent dome time trying to figure out why my device no longer saw the router."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a very helpful little app that does a great deal considering it is free:It can analyze the strength of your own wifi system.It can analyze the strength of wifi systems around you.It provides data on how well your network is operating.It can tell you the strength of the signal of your network and others around you.You can use it to figure out where there are dead zones in your wifi system and figure out more easily how to correct them.The old maxim, \"You get what you pay for,\" certainly isn't true with this excellent app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "First of all, at this time it was free.  Having said that, I would pay for the app later if they came out with a Pay version.  I am very visual and it immediately showed all the WiFi connections in my block.  It has several screens that show the information in graphic format and one screen that shows the strength in a full screen \"Vu Meter\".  This helps with the Kindle finding a sweet spot in the house.  I am using it on a new Kindle \"Fire\" and it does not appear to have any problems at all.  Another real nice feature is that it shows on one of the color screens the channel you, and others are on.  This helps as I was able to move to the \"high end\" on my router while most of the others in my area were clustered around the low area.  Once again ... very nice, visual, application for use with my new Kindle Fire.  Thank you"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I read the online help & everything.  Honestly, this app did nothing for me.  I saw some pretty graphs but that was it.  I saw that my signal is the strongest.  If that is what this app is form fine but other reviews made this out to be a way to boost your signal & I never saw anything like that.  Like I said, I saw some graphs & my signal is strongest.  Not worth my time to download this, even with it taking less than 10 seconds."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a fun app.  It has helped me figure out what Wi-Fi's are available around my house and while traveling.  It is fascinating to ride in a car (don't do this while driving!!!) and watch the various Wi-Fi networks come and go.  What blows my mind is that at work there are at least 3 at any one time.  I work in a huge building that has no work related Wi-Fi, so this means people must have hot spots near me."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app, is quite similar to  the other free one.  Sometimes it's a little harder to figure out, but still simple enough. This type of program just gives you a better view of what Wi-Fi's are around, and also more entertaining than what is on your Android device, but usually of not serious use, so what I like about this one, is that it can be moved to the SD card, and it does work on the Froyo version (and later) versions of Android.  This way I do have an entertaining informative app that isn't taking up valuable space."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "If you're curious about your Wi-Fi connections (and those of your immediate neighbors), this little app is fun to play with.  There are five different graphs/readings included that indicate the strength (or lack thereof) of your signal.  It can also be used on the road when you're looking for the strongest Wi-Fi signal to use.  There are also a number of settings included if you want to tweak your Kindle further.  All in all, quite practical and not too technical."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "When you move, your Wi-Fi modem just might be having problems because everyone in your neighborhood is on the same channel.  WiFi Modems use channels like Walkie Talkies, and when there are too many on the same channel, your WiFi Devices have a hard time reaching your modem.  This little gem will tell you who is on what channel, and what channels are not being used so that you or your internet provider can change the channel to one that is not being used, and you can enjoy delay free streaming!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The WiFi Analyzer works great on my Kindle Fire. There's not much to it. One look and I got the info I need. But I use it whenever I enter a business just to see if there's any wifi around. If I see nothing on the graph then I know there's no wifi. It also can do it in a parabola-type graph so you can see which wifi source is the strongest if there's more than one. I like having it, so I'm going to keep it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like this little Wi-Fi analyzer app.  It performs well and is very convienient.  It was simple to install and gives me a neat colored signal graft on how effective my Wi-Fi router is working on my Kindle Fire.  It also shows on the graft the other possible routers to click on if you wanted to go that route.  The graft is done up very nicely in multi-colors for each Wi-Fi channel available to you at any given time. At the very bottom of the screen is a tiny boxed ad that changes...it does not take away from the graft or annoy the person. If you travel from your home Wi-Fi router set up, this little app helps to change to an available Wi-Fi signal.  Pretty helpful!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is the best wifi detector i have seen.  It gives you a very good picture of the signals around you.  You can place your wifi on the channel that is used the least to avoid interference.  Just walking around the room with this thing is pretty interesting.  Driving down the road with it is even more fun.  I'm not sure how the other functions are used but the spectrum display is all anyone would need.  The screen gets really crowded in town.  The only improvement I could see would be to have the option to highlight the open systems so that you can pick them out of the crowd."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a cool little app.  I use it to sniff around places while I'm out and discover any WiFi hotspots I can connect to.It's also useful to see what channels are in use in your neghborhood (2.4GHz or 5GHz) so you can move your AP to a non-used channel further away from all the others who are running the default channels that came with their wireless box.  Everyone in a neighborhood running on channel 11 or 6 or nn is not good.  Its also useful to determine the type of encryption being used by the various networks before trying to connect to a network.  I also use it to determine which band on my dual-band network gives me the greatest signal strength when I'm in the far away rooms of my house so I can connect to the strongest."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is perfect for those times when you're totally stumped on a crossword.  You enter the letters you have and question marks for the blanks, and it will give you a list of possible words.  Clicking on a word will show the definition.  Doesn't work for proper names, unfortunately, nor does it work if the answer is multiple words (e.g. \"peanutbutter\").  May return a huge list of words if you have too many blanks.No ads!  Huzzah!Works great on both the Evo and the Xoom."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I loved this app. It is interesting and fun. It levels. are challenging and make you think. You can change the speed of the orbs and you can choose between two moods, survival mode and regular mode. What more can you ask for. I loved it all of it, except for the time limit. I mean several times I was one orb away from beating the level, and time ran out. I found that incredibly annoying. I would have played survival mode, but I like beating the levels. I really loved how the levels were layed out though. The idea of going through tubes to get to other tubes is genius. I highly reccomend this app it is 100% worth the price. If you are looking for a fun entertaining and somewhat addicting app, look no further. Dragon Fire is here."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a nice little game - and excellent value for free paid app of the day. Works very well on the Kindle Free.You need to operate switches to get blobs of differently-colored fire to a color-matched home. The speed control is a very nice feature. You can take it on the slow side and it can be quite relaxing. I can only guess at how hectic it would be a full speed! You can adjust the volume for the music and the sound effects. Incidentally, the music and sound effects are fine and not annoying.This is a very solid 4-star plus game; however, I went up to 5 stars to counter some of the earlier negative reviews, which I felt were not justified."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I enjoy this game very much. I find it relaxing to play and I even enjoy the music. It is one of the few games I play with the sound on. I play every level until I get a perfect score on them all - and then reset the scores and start over. I really don't understand the bad reviews. Must be a matter of taste. I don't much care for high stress games but I don't mind thinking. Play in on Kindle Fire so the SD card thing is not an issue."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I agree with another reviewer here, who pointed out that this Dragon Fire lacks an option to change the settings of the game, in the event the player is colorblind.As a colorblind American, who has extreme difficulty telling the difference between reds, yellows, and greens in software, I encourage game developers to include options to turn on a &quot;colorblind&quot; mode.Many game developers, such as PopCap, already routinely feature this in their games.This game, Dragon Fire, would be greatly improved if such a feature was added in a future update."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've used Splash ID since the Palm m505 days.  Over the years it's been very reliable and stable.  It doesn't offer as much GUI distractions as some of the other password storage programs, so it does look/feel dated.  However, when combined with the new desktop manager, I still cannot imagine life without it.  If you are carrying over an old .VID file, the new one requires a lot of patience to properly import everything.  Splash Data's customer service was helpful to fix some of my mistakes."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "What more could you want from an app that shows you information about the phases of the moon?  Unless, you're a NASA scientist, I can't think of a single thing that this app doesn't provide.  And, in the process of providing this great information this app also makes it extremely easy to find and use.  I love the intuitive way you navigate on this app to enter your specific location and other \"what if\" information.  I was literally up and enjoying this app within less than five minutes.Who knows...when I become a NASA scientist maybe I won't like this app, but until then I'm going to stay inside (you go out in the cold MichaelH) and enjoy all the neat stuff this app has to offer!"}

Thanks for the freebie, gotta love the educational apps... grreeeaat."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This Is just something I downloaded for entertainment. However, I seem to have a curiosity on the phase of the moon. This program does that. It even has some other features such as a calendar to show what phase of Moon will be in on a particular day of the month.There are a few things that were a little rough around the edges. This program can be moved to the SD card. This is a very important feature, since most of my tablets are of the older variety and is good to make room on the main flash drive. The first time I ran this program on the card, it really didn't want to work. But that was the only time that it complained. It has fired up correctly since then. It does not show correctly what part of the moon is lit up, though the amount that seem to be correct.So, it is something to play around with, and doesn't take any space on the main memory."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "To address the one oft mentioned issue. The developer is now aware that it shows waning gibbous for today (1/8/12) and it only seems to affect today. He is working on a fix for it. If you're guess that means you get a quick reply from the Dev, you'd be absolutely correct.The app works beautifully on my Droid 2 Global and I had no issues with it freezing. However, I did use the back button to exit out and not the home button. Overall, between quick developer response and the very slick, nicely done app, can't help but give this little darling a 5 star. If you like having the phases of the moon at your fingertips, this is the app for you and with it being FAOTD? You can't lose. ;)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is awesome. The graphics are so amazing, it's like you are at space camp looking at the moon through a telescope. You can see it with several different graphics settings too. It's so cool to turn the moon with my stylus or fingers, on my Kindle Fire HD, to view all sides of the moon. It even adjusts the date and time, when you spin it to accurately display the time your hemisphere will or did see the moon from that angle. There is also a calendar button so you can view the different moon phases for each day of the previous, current, and future month(s). Love it! And it's really only 70&cent; with the 30&cent; credit Amazon gives. Totally worth 70&cent; if you are into the moon or it's phases/cycles."}

(Can you say &#34;match-3&#34; or &#34;hidden object&#34;???)  Totemo begins as a very simple concept, but quickly graduates into some extremely challenging levels, all based on math and logic.  There is some &#34;background story&#34; -- though it does not affect the gameplay at all, and frankly is pretty mundane for the most part.  But anyone who likes a logic challenge should enjoy this game."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a game that will stretch your pattern recognition skills. Basically, you need to remove circles in groups. They have to be in columns or rows. Each level seems to have a couple of \"keys\" that will help you get started. I didn't need more than one try for a level until I got into the 20s. I find that it is very satisfying to clear a board.The visuals are pleasing. I think that this is a game that I will enjoy playing for a few minutes here and there until I finish it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've read that because this is a HD version it cannot be played on the first or second generation kindle fires. It actually can. I own more than one HD game and its just as clear as any other game. Now as far as the game goes: it's alright nothing great but not horrible. It's basically a matching game that gets harder as you move along. Kills time but I've played better. And the totem that &quot;talks&quot; to you is neither creepy or cute is straight annoying."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Yeah it sure is simple in the very first few levels but it does get interesting after you complete some levels. The graphics are very good and cute. The Totem keeps mumbling something or the other in each level as you get acquainted with the rules of the game. You can skip the mumbling if you like. It installed fine on the original 'Kindle Fire' even-though it says \"HD\" and I am keeping this on my Kindle Fire and play few more levels and update the review later if needed. But for FAOTD I think it is a worth a try. If you are into puzzles and matching games you will like it.Have fun!"}

The brilliance in this is not in endlessly matching 2, 3 or more rows of identical items, it's the pattern in which you unlock them that is the key to wiping out the entire level.  The little floating guide persona is cute at first but gets kinda boring after a while.  There may be too much backstory wedged into what is in essence an easy to learn but harder to master puzzle.Besides being a thoughtful time waster, the graphics and animations are all buttery smooth and game play is perfectly responsive.  A great effort!"}

I am having twins and already have them setup in my profiles.  =)It is always great to stop in at the pediatrician for a checkup and know the exact answers to those pesky questions:  How many ounces is she eating a day?  How many diapers, on average, a day?  This app shows me all of that in a time frame that I choose!It does so much more!I added all different activities as well.  Pictures and I go on!Enjoy!"}

It doesn't have the &#34;standard&#34; look, it is very large and I like to whip through the game and it is hard to scan it quickly if your eyes aren't used to it.

I'm a sucker for zombies. lol I was sorely disappointed. it uses a single zombie face and even then its not that great. vary it up a bit with different faces and sounds. the sample pic that it comes with looks a ton better than the one the app actually made. On top of all of that you (the developer) should probably remove the base picture after the zombie one is made. you move too far to one side or the other and you can clearly see the picture used. It's a good concept, but needs a LOT of work."}

It keeps saying 'authentication failed' whenever we try to add a Twitter account.I've kept the app hanging around on this tablet hoping that they would correct the problem in an update, but apparently that won't be happening -- perhaps because Seesmic is now owned by HootSuite, which has its own app it develops. That's unfortunate because Seesmic is the only Twitter client I know of that has a 'combined view' feature that merges our multiple accounts."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I don't use Facebook very much, so I can only say that from what I've seen, Seesmic for Android does a pretty good job with Facebook. Of course, the official Facebook Android app is so atrocious that a flaming sack of dog feces is preferable. As far as the Twitter functionality of Seesmic, I can definitively say it's great. I've tried a number of different Twitter clients for my Android phone and tablet, and Seesmic was the one I kept coming back to. The timeline is smooth and simple to navigate, managing direct messages and @ mentions is quite convenient, and searching across Twitter is dead simple. It's been over a year now since the folks behind HootSuite acquired Seesmic, but the Seesmic app has (so far) not been effected by that. If you're looking for the solution for using Twitter on your Android device, Seesmic is it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Tweetcaster has more features, but Seesmic was enough. I liked that Seesmic didn't ask for access to low level system log files (like Tweetcaster does) but disliked that it wanted my GPS data. Seesmic has a nice refresh button. It is hard to tell when something has been retweeted, and by whom. FB integration did not work for this Kindle Fire user, either. I would also have liked the ability to use a darker theme. I am keeping Seesmic and not Tweetcaster mostly for the data access issue."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app does what I got it to do, which was to handle the feeds to and from my facebook account. I can post my status updates easily, message friends, search, and read updates and view pics.  In other words, it does the basics well.  I also like that several posts that I was not seeing with Facebook's app were suddenly appearing.However, I noticed that one of my regular friends suddenly was not available through Seesmic (I checked the website, and she hadn't unfriended me!).  The other thing that I can't find is how to check in from a location).  For me, if those two issues were fixed, the app would get a 5."}

I got so excited when I saw an update was available for it, promptly installed it, but nothing has changed. No new chapter, no part 2, no difference whatsoever except a tiny option change that now allows for FX volume adjustment in addition to music volume.I would love a real update to this game with more gameplay.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I purchased this for my Kindle Fire because I really enjoyed playing The Lost City, but this was a disappointment.  Although graphics quality is excellent, this is really, REALLY too short.  It took me maybe an hour to complete it. Also the last puzzle was really finicky (blue circles on basement door) and the lightest touch will cause it to reset so that even if you've solved it once, you're forced to do so again (and again). Also, the ending was lame - a real anticlimax.It was also pretty easy, but I don't mind this if there are a lot of visually interesting scenes or landscapes.  In this game the graphics were nice but again there were only around ten different settings."}

I am a fan of the old school Shadowgate and UNINVITED games on nintendo, and this game is just like those!!! Sure enough, I was stumped about 10 minutes into the game lol. So if games like the ones I just mentioned or even Myst, this game will definitely hold you down!!!"}

I had read reviews, and some people said it was very short, and I figured it would be as long as the other one (Which took me about a week). I was very wrong..I could've finished it in half an hour.So I gave The secret of Grisly Manor 4 stars, because I was dissapointed in the length. (In my opinion. it should be free - it wasn't long enough to be worth even a dollar.)If you're going to purchase one, purchase The lost city - you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game, at first seems interesting but quickly you realize that its too short and has no replay value. once you solve the game there is nothing else to do, so max 20 minutes of playing. don't waste your money. spend that dollar somewhere else. got it for free and even that sounds like too much for this game, waste of space on my phone. if any new levels are created they're probably going to charge for them.

{"label": 1, "raw": "First, have to mention that if any of you have played the Nancy Drew games they will understand how much easier this is to play.Based a bit on those mysteries, but not with the complex moving around rooms to investigate, the action and finding of clues is entertaining enough and for the price, quite good.  The fact that it was short, played in less than two hours with a granddaughter, by candlelight and flashlight (power outage)  and the ending was a 'cop-out&#34;, caused me to be disappointed.However, I am sure that children and preteens will enjoy it, so based on age I think it will work fine for some.  Being a 79 year oldGreat Granny (who has played mysteries with grandchildren) might not make me the right person to review this adequately, for those of younger ages.  I guess what I am saying, is the challenge is there for the much younger generations, though not necessarily for teenagers."}

To be fair, a point-and-click adventure game featuring puzzles around a an abandoned mansion is hardly a new idea, but it felt like plagiarism.Regardless, the Secret of Grisly Manor holds up ok on its own.Pros: Challenging puzzles, point-and-click gameplay, decent atmosphereCons: way too short (about 1/2 hour), poorly detailed graphics (looks like very old compression), a couple of seemingly arbitrary puzzles/solutionsConclusion: I pray that we are seeing a revival of point-and-click adventure games for tablets.

The game itself is very short which I would have been fine with for a dollar but add that to the fact that there was no hint button and no instructions to any of the games and the clues where very  obscure and where not at all clear which puzzle they went to, and then the ending was just weird.  Anyway I don't recommend this game at all."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I liked this game a lot. I had to do a web search for hints a couple of times. I guess I just didn't have the patience to actually figure it out on my own. This was one of the first games I got in this genre, and I really enjoyed it. It was over pretty quickly. Felt like it could have had a bit more added to it, because felt short. I didn't feel ripped off or anything, just wished it had been longer. Fire Maple does a good job! Since finishing this game I have bought other games they have come out with and enjoyed them even more! Just buy it already, it's good."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "A great point and click game. You have to go through a house and find clues and apply them. No annoying hidden objects. All the clues are reasonable and discoverable, and you have hints available too. I only wish the game were a bit longer. This is also a good introduction to this kind of game for newbies or younger players, at least in part because you will be able to finish it and not have to go through fifteen scenes to get back to where you need. I wish Fire Maple would make more games like this!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "So the game play is fun and amazing, but my issue is the fact that you only need to solve about 5 'puzzles' to finish the entire game... For $1 it's a pretty decent investment for those looking for a way to kill 30 to 60 minutes - or more if you want to drag it out. The problem I had was I found out the solution in 2 nights of playing for about 10 minutes total. Great play, good price, would also love to see a sequel - or maybe a longer version of the same?"}

There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory (not the memory card), as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone.  Sorry Amazon- I will miss being able to download music directly to my phone from Amazon purchases- but not enough to use your app."}

That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone. The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings. It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "If this app came on your phone only your carrier can decide if you can remove it or not. Sprint did not preload this app on my phone. I chose to download and use it. I found I could move the app to the SD card on my phone. It works just fine there. I play music stored on my SD card far more than the stuff on my cloud drive. I like this app. I don't like reviews that rate apps down for issues caused by choices made by carriers."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this app on my smartphone. I can listen to any of the 431 Albums of music I've purchased from Amazon (over the years) on my phone, With headphones it sounds as good as an iPod. The app either lets you listen to the cloud songs, or to songs that you downloaded onto your device, my case being my smartphone.I would recommend this app for anyone who has a smartphone or Kindle (prob other tablets too) and who purchases mp3 songs/albums from Amazon. I ALWAYS use WiFi so I don't use data on my phone data plan. I've had no glitches, no freezing, no issues at all."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Amazon cloud where all your music is stored with unlimited space was supposed to be free with my Kindle Fire. plus I'm already paying $70 a year for Amazon Prime! The Google Music Manager still has unlimited space for free (or when you purchase music from them). that's where I will be headed when Amazon says my time is up, rather than getting nickled and dimed to death and having to choose and upload those 25 songs. Bah bye, Amazon. my next tablet won't be a Kindle."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "This Holloween Pumpkin Live Wallpaper is a fun interactive wallpaper that livens up your phone's background. This was one of Amazon's \"Free App of the Day\" so it was an easy choice to try. This wallpaper is a fairly simple game that allows you to explode regenerating pumpkins and knock vampire bats out of the air by tapping them in quick succession. This can cause the inadvertent launching of apps if you play this on a cluttered screen, so I only play it on a fairly empty screen.This is a seasonal app (at least for me) and I will likely change my wallpaper back to a picture of my family after Halloween.Recommended! This installed and ran perfectly on my HTC EVO 4G (Android v2.3.3).CFH"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This live wallpaper looks and does exactly as described.  I was happy to try out a Halloween themed wallpaper for a few weeks until Halloween passed but I am uninstalling it now.  You have some options with a few different backgrounds:-you can choose between 3 colors of fog and how much fog is on the screen.-choose how many pumpkins but u can not remove them all-there are bats that fly around on the screen which you can remove.I guess it can also be a game too since u can get points for smashing pumpkins and bats, it will keep track for you.  But that got old after 10 seconds.Parts of the app are nice but I would like to be able to remove all pumpkins or at least move them where I want, just so an apps icon is not sitting directly on top of one.  There was a pumpkin sitting directly underneath my camera apps icon and it made it semi difficult to see.5 stars for the app fitting the description.1 star for how much I want to use it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app works as described. I have an EVO 4G and I did not experience any lags. The live wallpaper is almost like a mini game as you can tap on screen to make the jack-o-lanterns explode and the bats fall. There is a counter on the lower-left to keep track of how many you got. You are also able to select from 4 different backgrounds, fog amount and speed, pumpkin and bat amount. Overall this is a neat little app for this months event. The graphics look much better compared to the 4th of July fireworks live wallpaper app."}

I found this app and installed it (it was $0.99 back then now its free) when I should it to our friends they were in awe that ours was so much more realistic... Its sad though the author has moved on and made this app free and has never made any more cases...The one thing I would love is if the author made one last change to allow user imported images for cases... if i could get 2 more requests then make a user selectable color scheme for the flame colors as well... (meaning chose one of the presets or a user selected color scheme)Thanx for making such a great app!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a good app.  It doesn't do anything that IMDB on your laptop or desktop doesn't do identically.  However, if you want to experience a genius use of IMDB, install the Google Chrome Browser onto your laptop or desktop. Then add the free IMDB extension for that browser.  Next time you are reading about a tv show or movie, highlight it with your cursor.  All of a sudden, the extension lights up on your toolbar with a red number.  That number is the rating for the movie or tv show.  If you want to read more, click on that red number and a new tab will open and you are there on the very page and can read the synopsis, reviews, cast list, etc., I use it every single day."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm sorry to IMDb for this review. Maybe it could be useful, if I cared about looking up movies/music/whatever this app does. But, this app was automatically installed on my phone (Motorola DROID RAZR MAXX HD 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)when it automatically updated to the Jelly Bean software version. I guess Amazon and Motorola and Google are all paying each other off - because now I am stuck with FIVE apps from them that I cannot delete. Please let me delete this - I bought my phone for a lot of money, I should not have to have your junk on it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Okay there was just an update, so some of this may have been addressed. I love the app when looking for a movie, and I am kind of an IMDb junkie so in general like the tool.The thing that was bugging me was the news feeds. They would get stale, and couldn't figure out how to refresh (and I am talking by weeks not hours).So that may have been addressed in the last release.Also would be nice to attach to Amazon more(since it is owned by them) so I could watch directly or see pricing easier but I may just not know how to work that.The trailer stream great even at 3G which is good when you got to entertain a 4 yo for a few minutes."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I haven't seen any reviews that include this, so I'll edit if I figure out a way to avoid this. When you die in the game, you start over. Not the level, no... the entire game. Back to the first dungeon. Also, apparently I have to be very careful about hitting quit, otherwise your progress won't be saved. Other than those two issues I have, the game is fun. I feel a little helpless when I can't find a new word though."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have to agree with many other reviewers that it is frustrating to not be able to have your progress saved.  It is also a bit Monty Hall when looked at as a quest game instead of purely as a timed word game.It is a challenging word game, especially when you are attempting to make a word from rapidly shifting letter tiles.  I also find the objects found after defeating the various foes pretty amusing.All in all, a cute little word game with an interesting slant, good for a waiting-room game.  With a little more complexity (ie collecting found items for a bonus,  or perhaps an honest-to-goodness quest), and the option to save your progress,  this has the potential to be a 5-star game."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As a fan of dungeon crawlers AND word games, I couldn't pass this on up, especially as the FAOTD today.  I hadn't seen it before and probably would have paid for it as it sounded so intriguing.  I usually don't like timed word games as I'm not all that fast, but this one providers a reason to hurry besides a clock ticking - create quickly or die!  I like that!  It gives you the choice of three levels , kids, normal, or wizard which is great though I haven't checked out kids or wizard yet.  So I'm enjoying it so far and if I find it gets harder where I'm dying all the time, I can (shamefully) move to the kids level."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like this word game because it has a different twist to it.  I actually worked a little harder to find longer words which I was able to do. So far I have only made it to level 8 and when you make it this far you are occasionally given a cool book of lore which gives you a choice between two rewards. It does seem to get challenging in a hurry, but that is okay with me because it last about the right amount of time for playing. I am happy that it closes when you exit the game.  Also I thought the game gave enough vowels and appropriate consonants to actually be able to spell words. I feel intrigued enough to want to keep playing. Highly recommend."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Interesting game. I could care less for the story line but the game with its levels and bonus letters is fun and challenging. The dictionary that you play with has words that even people with a good vocabulary will never find them all. I like that it reminds you if you have already used a word. and that it allows plurals and other varients of the same word. Makes the game fun even for the children. It has three levels of play and that is good too. Over all its a little above average. Not my favorite game but certainly not one to uninstall the first day you have it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I loved the game! I am a big fan of word games and the extra challenge of finding words to kill dungeon monsters makes this word game really fun! I loved the concept! my only complaint is that it was a little too easy on normal mode. I finished all 25 levels in about 45 minutes. I am looking forward to trying it on expert mode next. definitely worth the free download today! if you like word games like boggle or scramble, you will almost certainly like this game too! Also has a kids mode. based on the difficulty level of normal mode, kids mode would probably be fun for kids between 9 and 12."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a must have app if you frequently shop on Amazon. It runs really smooth on my evo, makes shopping on amazon a breeze. Much easier to use than a mobile web browser to view the web page on your phone. I use it frequently when I am out shopping and want to check prices and reviews. Amazon is almost always cheaper than local stores, so its an easy way to save money.Ordering items through the app is very easy. I have completed the process several times and had no errors or order problems.The one problem I have with this app is the bar code scanner. I can almost never get bar code scanners to work and this app is no different. I often feel like an idiot standing in a store trying to get this app to read a bar code. On the flip side, the app almost always finds the item I am looking for when I search via keyword search or texting a picture."}

I'll be all up in Walmart looking at hammers or shovels or bone saws or something and the Amazon app is all like \"Yo dawg, I'll get you that sheeeiit for half price AND I'll ship it right to your house fo FREE!\" When the Amazon Prime benefits kick in it's a joyous occasion. I'm celebrating this app's magnificence with 5 stars. Do it.Do it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Since this application became available last year I have been using it regularly to make educated decisions about what I buy in the local stores and what I buy on-line. It also provides me with the invaluable knowledge of the Amazon rating system that we all feed with our comments.I'm not going to add a bunch of pro's and con's here about the current version. We should reserve those for the feedback tool that the Amazon developers have.I will just add that the barcode scan and the photo recognition tools work phenomenal and the query is very quick. So, whether you grabbed something at The-X-store and want to see how good it is because it caught your eye, or if you are sure you want it, but you are concerned abut the price, this application will very likely help you decide what to do about it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "often i am looking for used art books and if i want to do a quick comparison shop i simply use this app to look up the item at amazon and quickly check the reseller prices.  then i switch to the ebay app and check the same item.  it is a toss up on which has the lower price.  it can go either way.  i simply swipe back and forth on my ipad to go from one app to the other.  the whole process takes at most five minutes and i can place a one click order on amazon if it has the better price.  this is much, much faster and easier than using the web browser.is this as fully featured as the web browser?  no it is not.  the ebay app is a lot more robust.  however, this is a really good start."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've had this app since 2011 and have been very happy with it.  However, last week I was prompted to update it so I did.  What a mistake!  Now it doesn't work.  It says it does not support digital purchases.  Then in physical merchandise, there is no Buy button.  So it doesn't work!  I've got it installed on a Samsung Galaxy 3S phone, the same device I've had it on for over a year.  So it was that last update that rendered it unusable for Samsung products.  If you have it already and it is working, DON'T UPDATE it!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like using this app while shopping just to make sure I can't get a better price elsewhere.  If I can, then I order it from Amazon right there on my phone in whatever store we're shopping at. Sometimes, the prices are better in store, so this app helps me feel like I'm getting the best deals on what I'm shopping for.  It's good to also check reviews on the fly to make sure I'm buing something worth my while.  This one is a must-have app."}

Using this app on our LG Ally, I quickly found the item on Amazon, ordered it, and sent it on its way to her house a thousand miles away. She had it 2 days later. We bought the original jar for her from Amazon, so it was easy to find again. Trying to do this on a laptop would have required a wifi link, but none was available. Great service from Amazon and an easy-to-use Android app from Amazon."}

We live 2 blocks from the fire station &amp; becuse I'm nosy, it's perfect for finding out why the sirens are going off. This app uses internet streams that people broadcast to the internet, not the actual fire/police frequencies. The scanner is in real time though, because of the internet streaming you won't be able to get car to car, specific police or anything like that unless the person streaming that area is also streaming those frequencies. If you want that kinda stuff buy a real scanner, but if you just wanna know what's going on get this app. If you get the free version too you can stream 2 different frequencies. I scan the county &amp; city police with free version &amp; county fire/ambulance with pro version. This is the best app of this kind. I've tried them all. Great app!"}

I enjoy it off but it is fun no madder what. end of stories great game"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "My daughter got this game for  her Kindle Fire, and we've played many times together.  The only thing I DON'T like about it is that if you want to jump more than one space at a time, you actually have to get permission from your opponent!  A box comes up asking if it's okay to jump more than once and if you hit no, then you can only jump once.  I don't think you should have to get permission on a game like this because you can use it against the other person, and the rules of the game are that you CAN jump more than once, period!  Other than that, it's a good game of checkers without the cats knocking the pieces all over the room!!"}

Overall I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking or a good time and a sturdy checkers app on the go. There is also a free version of this app called checkers free which is basically the same, but if you enjoy this game frequently remember to support its creators who brought you the opportunity to enjoy it, you will also want the paid version if you detest advertisement which can get annoying and in the way of your game play. This publisher also offers an outstanding chess app if you like to play chess, it's called chess premium or chess free."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "playing on a kindle - game works great! no problems with controls and I usually have trouble with them. you can move the control stick to wherever you like so it is comfortable for you. I have not played all levels yet but enjoyed what I have played. the breakaway talking is a bit much but can be turned off - radiant had the same chatter and I am used to it. (I got that one from the faotd awhile ago)  this game is definitely worth a try and is amusing!! if you like arcade type games from the eighties you will probably enjoy this."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game presents a clean aesthetic where you control a square that must escape the other &#34;evil&#34; squares trying to catch you.  You get some neat powerups that let you destroy them (like the power pellets in Pac-Man) and there are some other puzzle-type elements.  However, after just a few levels you feel as if the game has run out of ideas and you're stuck just playing more difficult versions of the previous levels.  It also tries to present a &#34;story&#34; with quotes from certain other block characters but it all falls a little flat."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Anyone who doesn't give this game a proper chance and passes it off as a pac-man ripoff is sorely missing out.  It has action, puzzle-solving, stealth, and humor.  It requires quick thinking and reflexes, tests your wits under pressure, and is a whole heck of a lot of fun to play.  The simplistic graphics are crisp and vibrant.  The controls, while not perfect, get the job done.  I did have a bit of trouble during the last couple of levels where pinpoint accuracy is required to successfully evade the onslaught of red blocks, but this was far from detracting enough to keep me from loving it.  I never expected to like this game so much, but it turned out to be a real treat."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "this game is way better than pac-man because it has more things you can do then pac-man. I wont give any of the secrets away, but u can move stuff and trigger things and even get shockers that make the red squares(bad guys) freeze for a bit...( kind of like pac-man). There is only one thing I would change and that would be the controls. idk how I would improve them,but now they are abut hard and ive died a few times because of them. but besides that, this game is awesome!! #waybetterthanpac-man(;"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is top notch. This is like Pacman, but better I think. There are elements of this game that surpasses expectation. The controls are fine, and I was able to play with effective accuracy on my first tries.The game looks and feels great. Worth a good score. This game had been out for quite a while on the google play store. People there seem to navigate the controls just fine and downloaded by the THOUSANDS!! -(4 1/2 stars on google)-EVAC is a tried and true game, minimal permissions IMO and top 10 FAOTD for the year. Hexage is a top developer with good support. Not sure why Amazon users are hyper critical on FA'sOTD!With no IAP, reasonable permissions, decent controls and gorgeous retro style graphics. This game is worth is price! Ignore the cheepos that can't use there touch screens.Support this developer, they make great games with good support and is a mature company that innovates its products well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really enjoyed this at first, but eventually the non-intuitive and clunky controls made it impossible to move blocks or escape the red guys at a fast enough  pace.Another annoying thing was the messages from the evil guy would interrupt the game and put a modal dialog box on top of the screen which obscured the maze. You'd have to click to dismiss it and meanwhile you were interrupted in the middle of escaping from the red guys, and when the box went away you'd have to quickly figure out where you are and what you were doing. I lost a lot of life points because of this. They should have the boss's taunts appear in an area separate from the maze so it doesn't interrupt the game.Otherwise the game was fun, and the power-ups were a nice addition to Pac-man."}

Not a problem for more modern devices or those with memory to spare but smaller or slower units will suffer.Overall, not that terrible if you don't mind the ads and the forced internet connection (both of which I despise), but might require that you watch the memory usage."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I use to love the Dictionary.com app. Now, I tolerate it. The most recent version tries to predict what word I'm looking up, and it's nearly always wrong. Sometimes when typing in a word, it will display a drop-down menu with a list of possible words. My word will be in the list and I will click on it, but at least a third of the time, it doesn't know the word. How can the word be in your drop-down list, but you don't have a definition for it?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "i am a creator who relies on writing for much of what i do. when i copped my Kindle Fire i immediately went to the dictionary that came w/it. while it is an excellent dictionary IMHO, it is not the most intuitive when it comes to looking up words. i've been using the Dictionary.com site for a few years now, so i started using it through the web browser. since navigating sites w/mobile devices can be tedious at times i installed this app when i found out it existed. it does exactly what i need it to do. when i get some loot i'll likely cop the ad-free version.i highly recommend this app if words are important to what you do."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is one of my most used apps.  I seem to manage to have to look up at least a word a day and this little app makes it easy.The best part about this program is it automatically try's to fix your spelling of a word.  To me, that is so refreshing because chances are, if I am looking up a word, I don't know how to spell it!Just realize that you need to be connected to the internet to get to the data.  Good luck!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I find my spelling has gotten worse throughout the years and I always want a dictionary available.

As a former English teacher, I love being able to check the spelling or find that perfect word in my posts, saving myself the embarrassment of getting caught slaughtering our language online. I find myself using my Kindle more for posting, now that I have the convenience of Dictionary.com with me on this devise as well as on my computer."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Maybe its this generation but its so much easier to go to the app then find a real dictionary. Not to mention this goes with you anywhere without adding 5lbs. Love the thesaurus also, comes in handy since I do a lot of puzzles. Even as an adult you are always comming across new words so having it speak the word is a nice feature. And granted I don't look at the word of the day every day I think its another great feature. Before my son uses the free time on the kindle I am going to have him to an exercise using this app and the word of the day before he plays any games."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This App, is a really good app, complete, with a lot of interesting link, and the pronounce of the wordOf course to save the precious memory of our Android devices, the database is on-line, so when you can't have connection, the program doesn't works.Some android devices can install application on a additional memory card, and a release of the app, installable on a memory card, working off line will be great.So if you have no problem to stay on line, this is a really great app!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As dictionary apps go it is what it should be, full of words and their meanings. It tends to be a little light on meanings and potentially relevant examples or use in context. I use it alot and enjoy the word of the day feature, but the word of the day doesn't update every day (not sure if it is an application hang-up or if the publisher doesn't update daily). It also has a great audio feature on how to pronounce the word (which is cool!). There are some other neat features and factoid tabs that offer an intellectual distraction from time to time. A very solid 4-star recommendation. As a freebie it is solid."}

Anyway, some reviewers state that younger children have fun with it.You can make a big bubble by holding your finger on the screen, or several bubbles by touching & moving your finger around the screen. Tapping a bubble will break it. Just like real life some of the bubbles break on their own. Nice bubble sounds.It works fine on my Kindle Fire HD."}

Both games are good, I have noticed that numerous Apps that are listed as free for either games or other things are just as good if not better than the one that one has to pay to get.  Would recommend any of the Solitaire Games with 4 to 5 Star Rating that are free for the Kindle Fire HD."}

Solitaire (Free) is one of two apps of the nearly dozen I've looked at that satisfy both of my criteria.  The other is Klondike Solitaire by Softick Ltd.  Unfortunately, Amazon system won't let me insert a link to the Amazon page for the other app, but you can find it by using Amazon's search feature."}

The runner-up was the app from MobilityWare, which is a very good game - but its ads were so intrusive that I had to get rid of it. The Ads in this game are tastefully off to the side, and do not intrude on my playing enjoyment. It is otherwise absolutely as good, or even better than the MobilityWare game. All it lacks is sound - and I don't really miss that. Bottom line - this is a 5 star keeper!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The game is good but there is nothing new in this version of the game... I have played many different versions of this game for PC, and Android.. Almost all are identical .. the only thing the really changes is the graphics from game to game and the design. but the play is the same and the rules are the same as well. Fun and challenging game to kill some time. Not a game I would keep on my Tablet for to long only cuz it only has 112 levels and in a matter of 2 minutes I beat the first 10 already.. seems too easy but it's still a time killer. Fun game for kids to play to keep the distracted. 4 stars for the game only cuz it lacks change that sets it apart from the rest."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Music was good though repetitive.  Scoring seemed off in that a single move would sometimes count as more than one.  There really needs to be a reset button you do not have to dig through menus to find.  Also the reset button does not work right if you have finished the level.  It puts all the bricks back but does not return the red brick.  Finally the controls seem to be off because when I drag a block all the way across the field, i find i have run out of screen before I get the block half way across which means more moves since i have to lift my finger."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have liked sliding games in the past and this one for the Kindle fits the bill. Graphics are simple but colorful. The music is very pleasant and not irritating. Game play may be a bit slow on certain touched, but overall not bad. The only thing I do not like is the fact that I think it might be almost impossible to make the target score. Every square you move to counts as one move. The movement of one piece should count as one no matter how far you move. Download and enjoy!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was lured by the first 15 puzzles. I was cocky and feeling full of myself.Then \"BANG!\" I was thrown a tough one. I was not so cocky any more! The puzzlesin this game are good strategy builders. The target number of moves seems easy at first,until you realize that each move is scored by the smallest square on the board. So far,I have only done one puzzle that I came even close to matching the target number of moves.That, however, will not deter me from trying to beat it!! Give it a try, and you will beamazed, frustrated, elated and relieved!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Perhaps I don't understand the program all that well, but I have used Rob oform for years and can't get along without it.  Unfortunately, it has no Android app.  If I could find a way to import my Roboform passwords, I would like it a lot better.  The thought of having to add 100s of them into a new data base is daunting.  I'm not sure if the resulting KeePass Droid data base is encrypted or not.  Wi-Fi is so vulnerable."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "There were some really hard words on the easy mode, so I can't imagine what words they have on the hard mode. I wish it could give you some clues, at least. It's annoying how in like six missed letters, you loose. One time I played alone and got 3-28. I was getting owned by my own Kindle Fire! This app is certainly not for kids because it's too hard. The time might come when you stop trying and you're just pressing random letters... Very annoying."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a good game. It is nice to be able to play the game against the computer, because then you don't have to admit to anyone else that you like to play hangman. ;)However, I HATE the font. It's hard to read some of the letters. For example, the \"O\" looks like a diamond that has been hollowed out, and it has four sides. I suppose it is supposed to look like someone chiseled the words out of a rock tablet, but it doesn't, and it's just annoying. When you're using letters to guess a missing word, and you have to keep remembering what the letter you're looking at represents, that's a drawback. With a better font, this game would have rated five stars."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I played this gave with three of the most read people I know.  One had a 10th grade reading level in 4th grade, they couldn't get the answers either.  I think in their effort to not make it too easy, they did the opposite.  You might loose for example, because  the word was a plural and you didn't spell it that way or because you had to live in Africa to even know that animal existed.  I'm sure it will be just what some people want.  Just not me.  I'll stick to scrabble and make words I know with the letters I have."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is really good. I love it but the only downside is that when you play single player your playing with the computer and the computer gives you words that you don't even know. Like krill like seriously 5 years old play this there not going to know what that is. And the computer  is hard to beat it like wins every time. I highly recommend this game to people who love hangman and want their kids to enjoy. But if you let your child use this game don't let them play single it's t ok hard. Play with them and go easy on them their little. Really get thus game it's so fun!!!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Great as a solitaire.  Only problem is trying to keep a continuous score.  You cannot press ok and then leave the game.  Just leave the game.  When you come back your score will be there.  If you press okay.  The next time you play the game will be set at zero.  Was able to get it up to 1000 wins, but don't know if that's all you can go, or if I pressed ok by mistake.  Trying again."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire.  It is loaded with useful information and pretty easy to use.  It does not come with any detail instructions or help menu on how to use, but most of it is self-apparent.. Much detail information about the house being looked at can be seen by scrolling down the pop-up window that opens when a home in the map is clicked-on.  I did find-out by hapenstance that when a home for sale has associated pictures in this pop-up, they can be viewed full-screen by clicking (just once) on one of them.Unfortunately, when I checked my neighborhood for housing activity I was surprised to find that one home that sold recently, and another that has been on the market for a few weeks now were not identified as such (and yes I preset the Zillow filter to include homes for sale and those recently sold)."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this app.  I use it on my home computer all the time.  Every real estate agent says NO NO NO  don't use this let me get your info, but in my experience this gives me comps, five years worth of taxes and graphs to show what the house and surroundings are doing, past and present sales.  Also what the list prices on the houses and what Zillow thinks they are should be selling for.  Most times the houses sell closer to Zillow estimates that what they agents listed the houses for. Great App"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Home values are way off!  Typical &#34;Zestimate&#34; prices are tied to accessed valuation, not to the potential sales price.  Price swings of $3 to $5k in a few days are crazy.  In my neighborhood, where houses are selling at or above asking price and are listed for only a couple of weeks before selling, Zillow estimates sale price up to $40,000 less than actual.  Sales ranges with a spread of $50 to $60k don't make any sense at all.  In new developments where new home prices are pretty much cast in stone, Zillow has &#34;Zestimate&#34; of up to $100k less!  My house, just as an example, has an appraised sale value of $289,900.  Zillow estimates the sales price to be $232,000.  My tax appraised value is $256,500. Go figure?  Don't count on this app to give you anything accurate."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a really cool app that is map based. If you have your GPS signal on your device on it quickly shows what's available around you. Don't worry you can look up any area just by searching for it. I like this app because you can customize your search to only show the places you want to see. For an example you can set it to have a house built in the 2000s that is at least 1,500 sq ft that's less than $500,000. You can look at pictures of the place if they are any posted. You can make the pictures full screen or simply keep it small to quickly look through them. You can sign up to actually have an account or connect with Facebook as well to save favorites or to share with family and friends. I haven't had any problems with this app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Other websites about real estate only list properties currently on the market. This one give the value of all properties. I looked up my own home and found an underestimated quote but I was able to add details to the description that changed the value. Now when you look up my home you can see a more accurate value. If you live in a tract development this may be helpful but where my home is each house is different,custom built, so all are different. This site also give past selling values of homes and that can be a real eye opener especially in this changing market."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "After entering my FL Zip Code, the data that appeared is in Hamilton, IN.  And, there seems to be no way/nobody to contact at Zillow when you see a &#34;problem&#34;.  Other issues include incorrect values of properties and listing of sale of my residence since I have been living here???  No way was my property sold to anyone but me!  Also, recent sale $ of property in my neighborhood is incorrect!?  Can't use this app since it's not reliable."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "While it provides some good information and will help you find out how much things are going for in a neighborhood.  It isn't always up to date exactly.  Sometimes a property is sold by the time you check it out and call on it.  Other times, it's off the market.  Some of the photos of the neighborhoods are out of date satellite photos and some new developments that are built out are still showing are bare earth.  All in all, it's a good tool, but caveat emptor, especially in anything to do with real estate."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I don't know what some of the people are complaining about.  This app on my Kindle Fire shows all the holidays that I can think of and I can't find any missing.  It is a great little app for calculating the number of days between two dates and has enough other features to help with other date related information (find a week number of a date or vice versa, learn about a specific date, add or subtract from a specific date, show events for a date, or show upcoming Friday the 13th dates for the superstitious crowd.At 345K on the Kinddle Fire it is not a space hog in the least.  Overall, I would have given this a 4 out of 5 just because it is so specific an app, but I disagree with many of the low ratings for this app so I've given it a 5 to offset some of the undeserved bad press."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm appalled at the level of ignorance and vitriol in these reviews. How can this app steal contact data when it doesn't have network permission? Access to contact data is required to add birthdays, anniversaries, or appointments. It's a shame that ignorance and anger is leading to fewer developers submitting good apps for FAotD. Amazon app reviews are rife with ignorant trolls who have inflated egos, an unwarranted sense of entitlement, and who aren't half as smart as their smart-phones.This app works great for its intended purpose. It's a handy adjunct to my Google Calendar."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is OK for when you are trapped in a queue and you are sick of people-watching, but the game is a bit of a bore.  It works well and I understand why it is full of ads (stuff has to be paid for somehow) and it is a free app. but I became tired of this almost on day one.  Something about the colours is a bit icky in my opinion.  But it was free so I appreciate having the chance to try it out."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Okay, well I suppose this app would be okay (actually it would probably be my favorite password manager) if it weren't for the fact that it let's the leeboard remember EVERYTHING you type in. For example, I decided to try it & the first thing I did was put in a login/password combo. Well, when I entered my password, it didn't show a blank suggestion bar on my keyboard. It showed my whole password right there for my phone to remember! (Yikes!!) So I haven't used itsince, because I don't trust it to keep my passwords safe."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Yesterday, I upgraded my Evo to Gingerbread. After the update, the password manager that I was using wouldn't even open. I was perturbed. This morning I checked the Amazon free app of the day, and saw this. I downloaded it, and am in the process of retreiving all of my passwords one by one to enter in to this app.This app has many customizable categories, many of which I will never use. So, I just delete the entire category. This app is EXTREMELY customizable.I really don't see what there is to dislike about this very useful app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "i have mSecure on my PC desktop, iPod and Kindle Fire HD. I use this app everyday on my PC - I like the security of having a backup on my tablet devices. At best I can say that it's a very stable app and the sync works perfectly. At worst the Android app is way overpriced for what little value it offers. However, it's GUI is underwhelming and setting up a new type requires each and every field to be set up manually - not even a default 10 field setup or ability to copy from another form. Changing the type can result in lost fields. The copy/paste to feature is a bit wonky - but it's probably the fault of Windows or the FireFox browser."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Works great on samsung vibrant, no problems with the 2.1 platform.However, this us a straight up maze game. While you may think to yourself that this has a maze section in it and that precludes all other sections from being mazes, that simply isn't the case. They are all mazes. Some mazes are a mine field of holes you have to negotiate around. Some mazes have multiple trickery objectives you can't access. Some mazes have plausible almost solutions. Don't be fooled! There is only one solution to each of these maps.If you are not good at judging the difference between one small gap and another, this is not the game for you. If you hate having to back out to start over because the ball is such in a made trap, this game is not for you. If you have hands that are in any way unsteady when you get nervous/angry/frustrated, this game will be hard for you."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm not a huge fan of the labyrinth type of game, and this is one of the less well polished versions I've tried. The graphics are quite mediocre. The ball seemed to want to catch and get hung up on everything. Many of the mazes have openings that are just a wee bit too small to get the ball through, so you have to figure out the proper path in addition to avoiding the pitfalls. Most annoying however are the moving sections, which can make the difference between finishing in a few seconds and taking a minute or more to finish.The app also has OpenFeint, for those of you who don't like being spied on.I think $4 is far too much for this game. $2 would be a more reasonable price, if it were a bit more polished. In its current state, 99 cents would be appropriate.Works on the Evo 3D and the Xoom."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've played a few labyrinth type games and this one of the better ones.  The 3D is a little misleading because 3D cell phones are coming out and this does not take advantage of that feature.  It is only 3D in that it moves around several dimensions and isn't flat.The game is pretty responsive and I didn't notice any lag.  The challenges are some of the better ones I've seen.  This was actually a lot more fun than other Labyrinth games I've played and it kept my interest far longer."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "A very useful app that allows you to track all of your accounts, set a budget, remind you when bills are due, even do transfers between accounts. It makes you keep actively aware of your finances.It is not connected to any accounts so you do have to keep your records as frequently as you do you check book. The app makes you accountable for your money giving you all the tools to keep an accurate accounting but it will not do it for you. If you forget or don't keep up with your spending it will fail you and frustrate you, but if you keep up with your accounts it will keep you balanced and disciplined. It has made me more accountable for my follies and more disciplined in understanding where my money is going, bad or good."}

Wanted to set up a budget, track spending etc. and I cant even get the dang thing to give me a correct balance!!!!  No instructions, no HELP offered, No headings or \"clues\" about what to do, or what not to do.  DONT BUY THIS APP UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO BURN!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I am not sure what the people who are complaining about this app are taking about. I have been using this app for a while, and have had no problems with it. As far as having to manually enter transactions I don't have a problem with it. There are many times when I go and buy a number of different items that are in different categories. If these transactions were automatically entered it wouldn't show that. In fact if the transactions were all entered automatically it would not show any categories. The bank certainly wouldn't know what category to put a transaction in. I have found that the app is very easy to use, and works very well despite having to take 15 or 20 seconds to enter a transaction."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "I've been using this app for over a year now and think it's still be best money manager on Android. Devs do a great job of listening to users and adding/fixing features. Ten dollars is the most I've ever paid for an app but I consider it money well spent.Edit: I see this is the FAOTD today. Guess that means all the crazies are gonna come out to trash the rating for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the actual app. It's a shame, really, since this is a terrific app that does what it says and does it well.

Luckily I check my entries every day so I can monitor this flaw.The second thing I would like to see is a way to export my entries so they can be printed out.

The app, as of 2013, has NOT been updated to the latest version.Also, if you go to Google Play Market (Google own Android app store), this application has also NOT been updated since 2012.Since the developer has abandoned this software, I strongly caution people NOT to use this app, especially for financial stuff.

You can't also get a summary of your accounts or any reports that include add all your accounts, just currency by currency. This makes the app totally useless. AndroMoney handles it and is free. Uninstalled."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Nice Radio but watch the Radio settings.I installed it on my new Kindle Fire. It ran great until the station was changing because it was in shake mode. Please do yourself a favor and change the Apps settings so that it does not do shake mode for changing the stations. This setting stays on even after the app is shut off or removed. It will interfere with the running of the Kindle Fire. Any movement of the Fire will reset the screen, and apps. Books will not open. Hard reset will not work. Device settings will open but will not correct the problem unless you remove everything by resetting to factory defaults.I reinstalled it and it seems to work again.Other than that. Its a likeable App."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I use this app a lot, especially when I travel. It really is the local radio station and not just random music.Some radio stations are not able to be played at certain times. I assume this is due to paid programming (ie Bob and Tom Show, etc) where the radio station subscribes to a program. This is frustrating, but I understand the issue. I would think that there would be a way around it because the you can listen to the radio free from that town, why not listen to it free from further away.I did find that if you listen to an actual radio and listen to TuneIn, they do not match up. There must be some delay before it get's to TuneIn. This delay is not 1 or 2 seconds but possibly minutes or several songs.It's still a great app and I use it."}

I have other apps for when I want to listen to &#34;genres&#34; of music pulled from a music library -- apps like Pandora, and even iHeartRadio.  But many of the other apps don't do live streaming -- or don't do it well.I often base my initial satisfaction with an app on how quickly I can open the app for the first time and get to what I want to do.  When I installed TuneIn Radio, it was because I wanted my favorite local FM station -- WDAV, a 24/7 Classical music station -- available when I was not at/near an FM radio.  I was up and running, listening to the station in just a minute or two.  That's &#34;ease of use&#34;."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "was tipped to this app by an Apple employee. Thanks! I needed a radio streaming app to get away from massive commercials and wimpy programming. TuneIn finds worldwide radio stations. Sometimes there are buffering issues. You can search by genre, etc. I had major buffering issues with an Itunes radio station - Venice Classical radio.  ( my favourite - just fine music, no commercials or rude interruptions like &#34;subscribe now!&#34; )Tunein has replaced Itunes Radio for this purpose. Very user friendly, many choices and a good alternative to Pandora as well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I SAW an earlier review where someone was humorously mocking indulging in old technology (although he enjoyed the app just the same), but I live where there is only one radio station and it isn't very good.  And you don't know how wonderful radio is until you don't have it anymore.  And the sound quality is good (I set the buffer to about 25 seconds) and the quality is really good and the selection of stations is wonderful--just wonderful.  I highly recommend this app to anyone. Also, I tried the alarm feature this morning and it worked great."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was thrilled to stumble on this app with so many to choose from out there.  Great selection of stations, but users need to understand that many of the stations aren't broadcasting 24hr/7days/week.  For example, I was able to listen to the Green Bay Packers game on tunein today, but that station is only available as a live broadcast unless you buy the pro version which I understand to be buggy and/or limited with regard to recording and playback options.  However, there are many live radio stations, both local and from around the world that are available all the time.  I'm so impressed with the free version that I couldn't ask for more.  I do recommend it highly."}

Battery usage is minimal. It plays for hours as I fall asleep with a darkened screen and hardly any impact on the battery whatsoever.

I am forced to fire up a task manager to kill the application.The other incredibly frustrating issue with the program is that, even after I have used a task manager to forcefully kill the app., the app. occasionally restarts itself in the background.Fix those two issues and it's a five star application."}

But, after 3 years of using that app and enduring the countless &#34;improvements&#34; and &#34;upgrades&#34; to that app, I finally deleted it, downloaded THIS one and am glad for it! No silly nonsense of endless &#34;loading...loading...loading&#34; or &#34;Buffering...Buffering...Buffering&#34; as the Radio.com app became, this one goes right to the preset station I listen to and works flawlessly.Good Bye Radio.com, Hello TuneIn Radio! :D"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Thanks to the developers for the fake review below! I cannot explain all the 5* reviews. I downloaded this app an hour ago, tuned to my favorite overseas channel and hopped in the shower. Admittedly it was a long shower but in 45 minutes I had to jump out, dry my hands, log into my phone, check the app, force start it, jump back in the shower and continue sudsing up, a total of 7 times. So you can see why I'm not enjoying this app. Sorry, but it's a big thumbs down and immediate uninstall.Maybe the next time the devs write another review they should be a bit more honest. one can wish!"}

(mainly twit) I like listening to obscure stations from all over the US reminds me of traveling by car. The free version has ads and the paid version does not but I like the ads, it's the American way!Sorry to say after listening to the free version, every time it changed ads there was much digital sputtering, making it unlistenable.Reminds me of the old dial-up days. The ads change a lot and if the ads blinked on and off, Whoa, Nelly! This is the first time I've had problems with Tune-In. I love it on my phone and Nook reader, so I went ahead and bought the paid  version, and what do you know....it's perfect!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Easily the best radio app I've seen. I replaced Slacker Radio and Scanner Radio with TuneIn as it does everything that both apps do better, and without any of the artificial limitations placed on most free apps. It certainly encouraged me to purchase the paid version. There is also no intrusive / annoying advertising.Pros:-- Wide selection of Radio stations, emergency bands, online streams, etc.-- No annoying advertising.-- No features advocating the paid version (features not available in the free version are taken out, and don't get in your way or pop up asking you to upgrade).-- UI is well done, and always keeps the currently playing station handy at the bottom so you can stop and start it quickly.Cons:-- None that I can honestly list as cons. It would be nice to be able to record radio, however, as this is in the paid version I can't honestly list it as a con."}

I live VERY rurally and can literally only get one or two country music stations on a radio - NOT something I would ever wish to listen to.  In my car, the radio reception is not a lot better.  I particularly enjoy talk radio and this app gives it to me in an abundance I had never imagined would be possible where I live.  Sound quality (with and without my cheap earphones) is perfect and it's no exaggeration to say that this app has changed my life."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Who needs satellite radio with this application? Well maybe you do because the interface for TuneIn Radio is clunky.The people who designed the user interface must be mass transit commuters because I'm convinced they've never used this in a car before.You have to pull over to use make simple changes in your car. You can't do simple stuff quick enough during a red light. I get about 80% of the way there when the light turns green, then at the next red light you have to start over again. But the radio selection is excellent and the quality is great. I play it through the Blue Tooth on my car radio.I wish it had a BIG Radio Button Feature so that I could change stations easily and a Re-Connect button when I lose a connection.It's close, real close, to being a great application."}

I like this one because it reminds me of playing around on the black board in my old childhood days in school.

{"label": 1, "raw": "The planes are shooting each other, and you have a classical music in the background. Funny to me. I enjoyed playing it. It's very touch responsive on Kindle Fire, and Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I played only a few level and enjoyed the game play so far. It's simple, and cute. Not too many buttons to press. The planes that has higher speed, makes me dizzy. It spins so fast, and moves so fast. I prefer the slower planes.  My 2 years old son love to crash the plane. Definitely worth 2.99 but I got it as free app of the day."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is playing great so far. What I appreciate are that the controls are nice, and you get that 3D aspect where it feels like you are flying. That is one of the best parts for me, as it is amazingly fun, and I can see a lot of people gravitating towards this game for that particular reason. The music used in the game is beautiful and very soothing as you try to blast other planes out of the sky. The game itself is very easy to play, but going for all planes can be quite frustrating at times. It is worth the price and a fun time killer."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "Most games with a joystick of any type is quite hard to play without a physical controller on android, but this is by far the best I have come across. This can be attributed to its side-scrolling platform, but this just enhances play as the difficulty of 3D is taken away but replaced with loads enemies flying across your screen with different capabilities. You even get new planes after playing certain levels, which is great when you need that edge to beat a level that you can't do with your favorite plane."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a fun game. You fly your plane by using the joystick type control at the bottom left of the screen and try shooting using the fire button on the bottom right of the screen. Simple controls. You shoot the planes down that show up and the level progresses in difficulty. There are stars that fall from the sky and they have rewards or not. Sometimes it will freeze your enemies or sometimes it makes you fly slowly. Each star has either a benefit or a curse that only lasts a little while. Fun game."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this as the FAOTD a few days ago, and have been addicted ever since.  I still havent beaten the game, but I think I want to unlock all the planes and this is just anperfect time waster.  I can assure you that this is more than worth the purchase price.Good:*Gameplay is simple enough to jump right in, but deep enough that you don't get bored.*Loads of planes to unlock, and each one plays differently combining one of 7 different weapons with varrying levels of turn, speed, and health.*The mix of enemies on each wave is often challenging, sometimes sending you back to previous levels to unlock a better plane.*Multiplayer (haven't personally tried)Bad:*doesm't look like it would work well on a phone*occasionally the controls lock up, but that might just be my tablet."}

I have a list category tittled &quot;News&quot;, when I swipe into that page, the tweets do not load, the page remains blank with turning circle in the center indicating that its loading, but never does. The same thing happens when I swipe into my facebook page, it reads &quot;no news items&quot;, I cant get my facebook timeline. I wonder if anyone else is experiencing a similar problem."}

For ex, it has a barcode scanner--very easy to use and you don't need any extra app to use it--that automatically adds the scanned food into your tracker. If you are used to counting calories and factoring in exercise (for ex, on a points plan that incorporates both, such as WW) you'll find this app (and the online site) intuitive and simple. Also, the app, unlike the site, gives you a running total of the day's nutrition information all on one page so you can quickly see, for ex, if you haven't had enough protein for the day. Nothing but good things to say about this app."}

I adjusted my eating accordingly and began dropping weight immediately. I live hiw you can record what you ate and it will tell you how many calories. You can also track exercise. With everything you enter it will tell you where you're at on calories. Often I find that I can eat a small treat at the end of the day, and I'm still within my calorie alotment.

{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this Acton scanner 2 years ago when our older vehicle was repeatedly showing its MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp). I was able to clear the code immediately. When the MIL illuminated again later, I was able to track down the problem (O2 sensor heater trouble)and correct it by reseating the connector. Later, I used the scanner to diagnose which cylinder was misfiring. By tapping on that cylinder's fuel injector, I was able to correct the misfiring. Again, the Acton cleared the MIL display.My mechanic uses a more sophisticated (and much more expensive) OBD scanner in his day to day work, but for someone who does occasional maintenance on his own car, this tool is worth the $89 investment. If you paid more, you paid too much."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "I have two vents directly over my living room sofa and although I have lived with them blowing directly on me for a long time, a suggestion by a friend, had me search out diffusers.  I am really glad that I did.The diffusers work great in re-directing the air flow off of me and either into the room or towards the windows.  The magnets hold perfectly on my ceiling vents and the diffusers appear pretty sturdy.  So far, nothing has fallen to \"crack me in the head.\"The diffusers are adjustable so that you can get them to fit even if you have a vent lever or screws that may get in the way, which I do.I am very pleased and would recommend this product in that it absolutely helps."}

I wasted a lot of money prior to purchasing these unbreakable ones with the other type that don't flex and that break easily. The magnets are very strong, when I lift these up for cleaning, I pull the entire metal register out of the floor. The magnets are strong enough to hold tight on registers that have several coats of paint on them, too."}

Is not a eyesore, and seems well made, i highly recommend this to keep thieves honest, it wont guarentee a determined thief wont steal your expensive wheel/tire, but when the thief see's the steel cable wrapped through the wheel, it won't be so much a snatch and grab. Some piece of mind to myself. I run 31.10.50 x 15&#34; wheels (over $350 each wheel/tire x 5 = $1750), with a Smitybilt tire carrier, the 36&#34; cable was plenty long enough."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I really appreciate the Rain X in a light drizzle or mist, when the water seems to disperse by itself with minimal windshield wiper use. When you apply before the cold weather, though, it helps prevent ice from sticking to your windshield, which is just great. I also like to use the product on the back window, which doesn't have a wiper, because it keeps the window clearer. Follow the directions--let it dry to a light haze and wipe it off with a microfiber or paper towel until the windshield is clear. I'm sure you'll like it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product takes time to put on right but it is worth the effort.  When you are done you will not believe the results when you get into a rain storm.  Your windshield glass is so slick that the heaviest rain just slides right off without using your wipers.  Your visibility is improved dramatically and you can see what is going on around you.I use it often but especially when I am going on a long vacation drive.  It improves your driving safety in inclement weather and helps to keep your family and you safer. I use it on the outside of all of my windows of my vehicles.  It is good for rain, sleet and snow and even reduces the amount of bugs that will stick to your windows.  The treatment lasts for about 3 months.  It is only recommended for glass.The further you can see the better your response time to stop in case of an emergency.  I strongly recommend this product as doing a great job!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "What's to say?  It's not very large.  It works perfect in my 2003 Chevy truck to add a Fuel Additive into the fuel tank!!!  It should work for Power steering and transmission also, at least on Car/trucks that's not hard to get to or down load were access is bad.  The design helps keep you from spilling when your poring a fluid into it!  For under $5, not a bad deal.  Hang it up out of the way when done with it.  It's able to fit into your Transmission Dip Stick tube, so it has to be small enough, so you can just dump a bunch a fluid into it at once!!!  It's small and doesn't hold all that much.  For what it is, I like it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Bought this along with a No Spill 5 gallon can to use for track days. THe length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car. It also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. Two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1) It should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2) The diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size - would allow faster filling."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I am using this on a Curt receiver and the length is perfect.  It appears to be of high quality construction (with a bit if weight to it) and this design prevents any rattling on bumpy roads.  My only complaint is that it gets rust buildup inside the lock mechanism after a few months, so you need to clean it periodically.Update:A great deal of dirt has found its way into the lock mechanism so I guess the fit is not secure like it should be.  Also it is now rusting which I find a bit odd in all stainless construction.  I see the head design has changed based on the new picture here so maybe the issue is fixed now."}

The cap will not stay on to protect the key entry slot. Any little bump in the road, and off it comes !  Dirt and water gets into the lock mechanism, the key will not go in and you will not get it off with out a cutting torch."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I find it a bit humorous that reviewers keep saying &#34;it doesn't absorb water&#34;.. then they state later on that they have to ring all of the water out all of the time. Are they ringing out &#34;air&#34; ? Of course is absorbs the water. It is just not good at drying the car for the final wipe. I use a towel after using this. That's worked well for many years. I tried a &#34;waffle towel&#34; and it was worse than the absorber. I tried a special auto towel, but that did not work as well either. I think that the absorber used with a towel is probably the best combo to use. I suppose you can turn on the leaf blower, but if you get any dirt in there you may do a number on your paint."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "For those of you who are wondering \"do I have to keep the tube forever?\", the answer is \"no\".  I threw my tube away the first week I had it and three years later it still performs like a champ.  The chamois will dry out and become hard if left exposed, but once you wet it again, it becomes as absorbent and pliable as new.The other reviews are correct.  This thing holds an astounding amount of water for its size and weight and is excellent at streak free drying of automotive surfaces.  Once saturated with water, it wrings out very easily and it ready to pick more back up.  After three years mine has held up very well, though it is a bit discolored from the dirt it has picked up from my car over time.This is the only drying chamois most people will ever need."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have used these for over 10 years as well as natural sheep skin chamois. This works very well. If you wring it out (edges too) it doesn't streak, leave water behind, and works about as well as a natural chamois. It will also last for years if left damp and stored in the plastic container, (nope don't dry it). Then why use a natural chamois?  Well for me there is something about the shine left behind with a natural chamois. I'm 69 years old and have used those since a teenager. Now that maybe just a memory lane thing since this works just fine. If you don't want to dry, and as I do stretch and soften a natural chamois after use, then get this. It works very well, plus I have never found anything synthetic, that works as well. (Believe me I've tried a lot different ones too. Haaa)  I do recommend it. Hope this helps someone."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Awesome.  Just used this for the first time earlier today.  I've owned a natural chamois but haven't used it in years so I threw it away.  This works great.  Washed my car and then used a Water Blade on it (def another recommended product) and then used this on all the corners and tight spaces.  Soaks the water up very well, rings out a lot of the water and stores &#34;damp&#34; which means little to not maintenance to maintain.  Covers a lot of area too I was surprised once I unfolded it just how big it was."}

I have very hard water and when I want my car to look nice I have to dry it or I get little hard water spots all over the place.Drying my car with \"The Absorber\" does solve that problem and it does absorb quite a lot of water. It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in. I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water. But it dries to the point where the residual water evaporates in a minute or so. I consider that pretty good and my goal of not having water spots is met so I'm a happy camper. I would buy another one if I needed it :)"}

I enjoyed using it compared to a lot of other products I have tried over the years. I have found that Meguiar products generally are quite good. Price is not great but reasonable - I was satisfied and will purchase this product again. Oh yeah, I should have mentioned that I applied by hand with terry cloth towel and removed with microfiber cloth."}

It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two.The heavy rubber  Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W, Model# WC1467A  at $8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete, but they are heavy to carry around.  I use the Buyers' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk.Also NOTE that the Buyer's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50% more.  The Buyers ones are nearly identical, are exactly the same size and weight.  The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom."}

The few times I have used them they work well, but just so you know they have a recommended expiration date on them.

If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend."}

All I was looking for was better drivability and I think that's what I got.

I only say this because my wife has had people who change her oil try to sell her a new one.  This was a nice thing to see in the package.  They even include a card to put in the glove box with a 1 800 number for a service station to call if they don&#8217;t believe it!I have always put a K&N; air filter in my car and as long as they are around I always will.

It's the only one I've left out back over the winter and has survived the freeze thaw and the snow.  I've left it through two winters of snow and ice attached to the hose and it still works great.  Plus it functions so well.  The worst thing I can say about it is it's tricky to fit under some car wheel wells but that's fine for having a functional nozzle that does what it is supposed to do year and year.EDIT: 10/16/13 and I have two of these nozzles and one still stays outside all winter and both still work perfectly."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This hose nozzle lets out an amazing amount of water and looks like it could survive a nuclear blast.  I'm extremely impressed with the build quality and the functionality for washing dogs and my car.With my old nozzle, it would take a long time to wash the soap out of my dog's hair.  With this nozzle, the initial gush of water takes almost all of the soap away leaving them squeaky clean.  Same goes for rinsing soap off of my car.It's hard to imagine being excited about a hose nozzle but this thing is awesome."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have owned no less than 15 different nozzles over the years. One has been worse than the next. The ones you drop after you use which are made of plastic simply break. Then there are the ones with the several settings and trigger which constrict the flow so much that you would think it needed a dose of flomax! I have used many types in between. This unit is simply the best. I never realized the pressure I had restricted by using the other ones. When I turned the spigot on all the way, I could get a good steady stream over 20 feet no problem at all. I drop it after use without worrying about cracking it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I liked the concept of this, and bought two at the same time. We have small ranch, and varying watering/hosing needs. We typically buy the 7 way adjustable nozzles, but I thought these would allow more versatility.These nozzles perform well, but not as good as a conventional nozzle. For a start, there is no quick way to get the desired spray pattern, you have to slowly rotate the head and stop when you think it is what you need, often messing around 'finely tuning' it to try and get the best result. Secondly, none of the 'jet' part of the adjustments creates a clean jet, there is always a fine mist or errant second or third jet spraying in a different direction at the same time.These cannot create all the spray patterns found on a 7 way nozzle, and create poor patterns on the ones they can create.This is a good idea, but in reality you are better off with a 7 way nozzle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "HI,This product is a great product that helps you to eliminate rattles/vibrations when you are installing speakers into a vehicle's car doors, rear panels, decks, etc.  It does exactly that and it does it well.There are many claims about it stopping distortion, noise, etc....

Use it for that and you will agree that it is a 5 Star Product.  Expect miracles and you will be disappointed."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It works well, I am surprised that someone else does not make it[cheaper].  It is a very low tech material.  We used it in the doors of a friends car when speakers were replaced and spent over $100.  I bought three cans of rubberized undercoat at Wally-World for about $5 per can and my doors were just as quiet.  I guess it is just personal preference and economic priority, for me the extra $85 in the pocket was better.  My friend, well he spends money like a drunken sailor...not to offend any drunken sailors out there."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this for my 99 ford escort lx sedan, so I could hear my sony stereo more. I followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors. I have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers. I can hear them more and there's less vibration on the doors. As far as road noise goes, it helped just a little. This product isn't made to reduce the road noise, just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road. The road noise level is still the same in my car."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have an FJ Cruiser.  It's not a quiet vehicle.  I accept that.I have been working on upgrading my stereo system - replaced the head unit, put in 6x9 speakers in the doors, etc.  Well, the 6x9s are much more responsive than the stock speakers were, especially in the lower frequencies.  So, I developed a buzz.  I bought the Dynamat to see if I could get rid of that, after I tightened everything that I could find.Installation was easier than I feared - thanks for the tennis ball tip, BTW!  As far as the real results, though, I'm not sure that I've noticed a real difference in sound quality, noise, or heat.  Perhaps some.  The rattling has reduced, but not eliminated.Does the product work?  Possibly.  It's hard for me to say either way."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This has a lot of uses beyond car applications. I used a sheet of it on the drywall behind in-wall speakers to cut the amount of sound radiating through the back wall and tighten the sound. I used a sheet of it inside a computer case, to eliminate a tinny rattle that came from the case vibration while it was on. You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter.It does have one drawback, and that's the fact that once you stick it on something, you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess. It is essentially tar with a foil outer cover, and trying to get it off just leaves a bunch of sticky tar behind. So, choose the place you want it carefully before sticking it down!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Wow, this stuff works well!  We have a wall air conditioner in our home.  It is a quiet variety that we paid a good deal of money for, due to that claim.  It still had a bad resonance of some vibrating metal on the machine.I applied this to all accessible (front face) surfaces, and only the spots where there was not a decal or other item present, probably less than 30% of the total frontal surface (keep in mind 50% is the evaporator and blower vent), and the available space on the front cover.  Wow, we can definitely hear a difference in the room it is installed in.This thing has a strong resonance, so we can still hear it in other spaces.  I feel like it doesnt dampen all modes, but it certainly does enough for a noticeable difference in the space where we have the AC located."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have used Dynamat to combat noise in automobiles, dishwashers and even under a stainless steel kitchen sink.  The dishwasher and the sink were the most dramatic demonstrations of the value of this product.  The dishwasher was on the noisy side, until I had to replace a small switch in the door.  While I had it all apart, I decided to coat the inside of the door panel with Dynamat.  Now the dishwasher makes a soft hum as it running.  The sink was insulated, but it made that cheap rain on a metal roof sound when you turned on the water.  It was difficult to have a conversation and do the dishes at the same time.  Now it is dead quiet!  What a change!  I love this stuff.  I know that I will be on the look out for more Dynamat applications in my life!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I was originally going to get one of the small squares to go behind my newly installed speakers but after comparing the price per square foot, I decided to tackle a box of this stuff. A box let me cover four doors and my roof in my subaru wrx wagon.This car is my first non Mercedes in 15 years and although the subaru is still an econo box, this made the stereo sound way better, reduced road noise and give the car a more &#34; luxury&#34; feel. Well worth the price and effort to install."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After years of being an idiot and trying to gently use my fingers to prevent my door from scraping on the wall of my car port, I bought this. Works exactly like it should... by being a barrier between my door and the wall. The thickness is perfect. It could stand to be a little longer for my inaccurate parking jobs... but very good nonetheless. Even has two holes cut out so you can drill the sucker into a wall if need be.Note: The vinyl tape that it says is frequently purchased with this product will not work on a textured (stucco) wall."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "I would not hesitate to recommend these jack stands, as I have had very good results and they seem to be very well made.  The double lock is an absolutely mandatory feature in my estimation.  You should always use the jack stands with the double lock in place, as it adds additional security.  I am pleased with the height of the stands as well, as it is possible to raise the vehicle up a considerable amount, making it easy to get in and work.  I replaced the front suspension on my vehicle in an afternoon using these stands and they never wavered.  I went out and replaced the rear shocks, springs, and fuel filter the next day.  Once again, the stands were steady and solid while I pushed, shoved, wedged, etc. the rear springs into place.I am very pleased with these stands and definitely recommend them."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "1. The viewing surface of the 8 inch mirror is exactly 7.5 inches wide and 2.25 inches high.2. I tried adjustment of the mirror without mounting it. The ball joints on the mirror arm are so tight that adjusting is extremely difficult to nearly impossible.  WD40 did not work, neither did working the joints around to loosen them up.3. So if you try to adjust the mirror after it's mounted, you risk stressing the mounting button glue and the button may fall off.4. When adjusting the mirror, the day/night button kept flipping on/off.  Very annoying.5. The mirror surface itself is very good, no ripples."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "We have an SUV. I would normally setup the side view mirrors so that when viewing the rear view mirrors and side view mirrors, there is just a bit of overlap when looking at them. This presents a problem when backing up as you cannot see the curbs clearly. So this helps a lot. The side mirrors are now just looking straight back helping in parallel parking as well backing up to a curb. These mirrors help in making sure that when you are driving and changing lanes, you can see if there is any object in your blindspot without glancing over your shoulders. Great mirrors and to this day, they remain clear. I will get another one - the smaller version of these mirrors - for my sedan."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use this mirror in the office to see if there is anyone coming to my desk.  I sit with my back to the aisle and I was startled many times by people who'd stand behind me and snoop on my computer activities.I attached this mirror to the upper left corner of my monitor using the douple sided tape that was pre-attached to the mirror's back, and secured it additionally with a couple of Scotch tape strips .  Now with my periferal vision I notice if there is a reflection change in the mirror, and I will be aware if anyone is approaching my desk."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This oil is just right for the renewal of your filter and should be used instead of SAE 30 alone.  It adheres better and as packaged is much easier to apply than sticking it and the filter in a bag and mushing it around.  It also uses less oil and gives precise coverage.  Oil your filter and get better air flow and better particle removal at the same time.You might be able to keep uncle Phil away from when you are grilling if you waft a little bit of it his way on approach, too, but maybe you shouldn't do that."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this on a car with 2 year old K&N; filter. The car wasn't driven much, but I thought I clean it anyway. It's really easy. Spray on cleaner, wait 10 minutes, then spray with water.  Dry, then spray on the red oil. Much easier using oil spray instead of the other type.My car has 2 K&N; air filters, and I used 2/3 of both cleaners and oil spray. So I can use this kit for one more.  However I was more than generous (or spray-happy). I'm sure I could've easily use this kit on two filters twice (4 total), instead of 3 filters."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Washed the filter on a Friday evening and the filter was dry Saturday evening.  Sprayed on the oil on Sunday afternoon.  Very easy to do on a 2008 GMC Sierra 3500 HD Diesel.  My main concern with the dealer doing it was that they might not have let the filter dry completely before re-oiling it.  How would I have ever known if it were done correctly?  They said it would take about an hour.  I don't know how the filter could have ever dried &#34;naturally&#34; as is required by K&N, in only one hour.  I'm glad I did it myself and I bet you will be too.  This kit will probably last for at least three recharges."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My car and truck were both really running like crap... figured it was time to wash and recharge the filter. I sprayed it with their, basically soapy water, and waited a while as the bugs and gravel dust was loosened, and then rinsed it in the sink until clear. I let it dry in the sun for a few hours while I found something else to do, then sprayed the oil as if I were spray painting something... follow the instructions, don't want too much oil, don't want too little either. My Neon doesn't care if I over oil it, but my truck has a mass airflow sensor, it does care... it cares a lot! Under-oiling it causes the fine mist of gravel dust through the filter, too much clogs it quickly and I guess that's better than it going into the engine but the MAF Sensor gets coated with the oil and that will cause performance issues that the filter may have given you. It's a fine balance!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have a K&N; filter on my G35's cold air intake as well as on my truck, and have always use this to clean and re-oil it.It really works well. The cleaning solution really breaks down the oil allowing it to be rinsed off fairly easily and t he aerosol can makes re-oiling a breeze.The only issue I have is I ALWAYS run out of cleaning solution before I run out of the air filter oil. Granted, this may be a good thing as it prevents you from finishing cleaning off your filter then realizing you have no oil to re-oil it, which would leave you in a tight spot if you need your car to work and you can't get more filter oil quickly.So, even though I complain about that, it's really being picky."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The K&N; 99-5050 Filter Service Kit is all you need to keep your K&N; patented High-Performance air filter clean and performing at maximum efficiency.I have used K&N; Air Filters in my personal vehicles and also in my off-road competition vehicles for over 30 years -- with excellent results and superior performance in every instance, including better fuel mileage.The K&N; Air Filters should be serviced at approximately 25,000 miles --- they actually work just as well when they \"look dirty\", and they must be REALLY NASTY before the efficiency drops off.Take your time with the \"Squeeze-Bottle\" kit, and do EXACTLY as instructed -- your reward will be a cleaner-running engine that delivers all the power and efficiency that was built into it !!K&N; filters are proudly \"Made in the USA\" -- and known around the world as the finest filters that can be had at ANY price !!Amazon's speedy delivery is the icing on the cake !!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "K&N; Filter Care Service Kit - Squeeze BottleI bought the squeeze bottle version of the kit because I had heard the aerosol spray was difficult to meter accurately. I'm here to say that the squeeze bottle isn't a perfect solution either. I had to oil the Ducati Performance air filter for my 696, which is just a basic cylindrical filter except the \"dirty\" air comes in from the inside out. A typical conical filter on a car has the dirt collecting on the outside. The airbox on the 696 is set up so the dirt comes from the inside of the filter. This made it extremely difficult to oil properly.On a car filter, oiling the pleats evenly takes a lot of time and excess oil still tends to seep out. It takes some practice, time, and patience - probably a second filter doesn't hurt either.Overall: 4/5 stars, still difficult to oil the filter uniformly but easier to control versus the aerosol spray"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Works like it is supposed to.  I don't know if I really prefer the squeeze bottle to the spray oil, as both work.  The advantage is supposed to be that you are able to know how much oil your filter requires and can measure it out of the bottle.  I've only used the kit once on the filter on my boat, which is the stock filter and I have no idea the amount of oil it is \"supposed\" to have, so I just applied it as instructed like you normally would.  Good price on Amazon for the kit!"}

{"label": 2, "raw": "I admittedly didn't see the sound byte of the horn until now, and if I had heard it earlier, I would have thought differently. I installed this to have a lower, and hopefully louder tone in my horn. The factory horn was lower though. I realize this is probably more for motorcycles now, so on an Isuzu Trooper, it is a little pathetic. I blame this on myself though, and I realize the product is good for its intended audience. Just don't buy this if you havea  truck! The look of this horn, if you have it visible, is a plus, and the shipping and installation were a breeze."}

I am obviously upset.** UPDATE **: So, it is Dec 2012 and I am updating this. I found this exact same horn at the local auto parts store. It was black with the red stripe, and I bought it. Got home to swap out the horns and noticed the one I got on here was an FIAMM brand. So, I would guess whoever shipped me my stuff simply sent the wrong item. I never thought to check that it was the right brand, though.I have updated my star rating to 4. Can't find myself able to give it 5."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I gave these things a 2 star rating because we have 8 sets of them installed on our county patrol cars.  Not sure what the issue is but the bulbs are burning out at a pretty often rate.  I just had one officer tell me both his lights burnt out last night, 01/23.2014.  Maybe the 130 watt bulb is just getting too hot but we have lost about 8 to 10 bulbs within a years time.  Hope KC reads this and can do something about that issue.  Other than that, they are a great, powerful light that reaches out so you can see those darn deer ahead of you.  Be safe and maybe look for another type of light that will give you longer service life before you spend the money on these."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I like them - YES the KC is bigger now than it was on older models of the guards IT IS AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE and  I LIKE IT.They provide some protection - not a lot  but they do look good.I actually saw another set of these today on a Toyota FJ and thought how good they looked on the black lights they had. Then I saw a CJ with the old style ( there were aged ) the KC was smaller and the guards were holding up well after the years of use it was obvious they had."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Same handle and grip as the &#34;older&#34; unit on our 2003 Bigfoot truck camper, but the mounting base-plate has changed and would have required drilling new holes in the camper.  Luckily, I was able to disassemble the new unit and utilize the old base-plate and the old bolts that hold the handle to the base-plate.  The new unit utilizes a pin and friction washer to hold the handle to the base-plate.  Had to destroy the friction washer to remove the pin and separate the new handle from the base unit.  Then it was just a matter of attaching it to the old base-plate with the old hardware.  The foam grip on the handle lasted for ten years on the old one, hopefully this one will last as long!  Did not give it a five star since they've changed their base-plate mounting system from what they were using ten years ago."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this based on the reviews. Though it seems to condition the leather, it didn't really seem to buff up the finish and restore my leather to its' original, or near new condition. After cleaning all the floors in my home, and all of my car's leather interior, I followed the directions on the package for conditioning and protecting the leather seats in my car.  While it does make the leather more supple and soft, it doesn't buff up to a shine, or even satin finish, Instead, it seems to leave a dull, chalky finish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this with the leather cleaner. I found it to be very good, but you have to wait for it to dry, which takes about a day. It does not stay as tacky as the leather honey conditioner which I also have bought. I feel the honey conditioner will be better in the long run, but if the leather is delicate the honey could potentially make it worse because it is very sticky and can wear the material as you rub it in. So in the long run, this is a great option."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The leather sofa, love seat, chair and ottoman were faded and looking rough. One bottle of Lexol restored them to new condition. I cleaned some worn and stained areas with a good saddle soap with a day to dry. Then in one day I was able to go over the furniture with one coat. Use a dish sponge with the blue scrubber top. Use the sponge part, not the scrubber. The scrubber worked well with saddle soap to clean.Let dry for a day. Repeat. Expect the leather to darken. The white stains are curing salts that have worked their way out of the leather. They melt with the Lexol and return into the leather.The result is a buttery soft leather that looks great."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I mainly got this product for my leather jacket that I haven&#8217;t used in a few years and looked faded and felt stiff. It was so stiff it started to warp and bend that I got worried it would stay that way or get ruined.When applying I used a terry sponge bonnet and as I applied the conditioner to the black jacket inside lining (testing) it first came on really wet. I got a little worried but let it sit for two minutes and eventually the leather absorbed it. Before I had applied the conditioner my jacket had a faded almost ashy black and after applying the product it brought out a nice deep rich color and think it looks better than when I first bought it. Plan on using this product on all my leather items."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "A liter of this stuff will last you a long time if you don't have many cars with leather seats. I just bought this for my lambskin leather jacket and my leather gloves. It seems to really soften up the leather. I think my jacket was really &#34;dry&#34; and it felt considerably heavier afterwards. The leather feels much more durable. My gloves are also much more water repellant and don't absorb water quite so quickly. I have no way of knowing if this is the best product on the market, but nonetheless it's pretty darned good!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this conditioner last year for my leather furniture and have been very happy with the results.  It does need to be applied every few months, but I've used it on a variety of leather surfaces (worn leather sofa, dining room chairs with leather padding, office chair) with excellent results.  As long as you don't apply it too thick, it won't leave an oily residue, and it blends into the leather very nicely.  I've gone through the original bottle and a refill, and am about to order another refill.For application, the Lexol sponges work great.  They can be rinsed and reused and last a long time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "We tried Lexol in a vehicle leather seating application favoring its price over the more expensive URAD product. The Lexol didn't seem to have as much lanolin as the URAD, and we don't know if there is any carnauba wax in the Lexol product but we noted there was less post-application sheen with the Lexol product.If you can stand the higher price, try the URAD product at least once. If you're a long-time hard-core Lexol user, stay with it - it seems to work OK. You really can't get too worked abut leather conditioners/polishes can you?!?!  (But we prefer URAD having tried both)"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The Lexol pH cleaner worked extremely well to clean automotive leather upholstery and surfaces. Just follow the instructions on the bottle and it does a fantastic job. Always use the pH cleaner before you apply the Lexol conditioner since you don't want to apply new oils over existing dirt. The pH cleaner comes out as a clear liquid that is more viscous than water. I recommend using a terry cloth sponge to create more lather than just using a cotton cloth or terry cloth. I have tried several over the counter leather cleaner/conditioners and Lexol beats them all.Pros: Cleans leather without drying it. Very easy to use.Cons: The product is a bit expensive and hard to find compared to the over-the-counter products, but it should be the only product to buy and Amazon carries it!Overall: If you own any leather accessories or cars with leather interiors, Lexol pH cleaner and Lexol conditioner should be on your list."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "A relatively thick, viscous liquid that cleans leather like crazy.  You only need just a bit on a wet rag, then it's off to the races cleaning your leather.  I use this on a leather couch, auto upholstery, shoes, boots and a leather jacket.It only cleans, but it does that well.  For protection you'll need something like Lexol Leather Conditioner (furniture, auto, jacket) or Nikwax (shoes and boots).A little goes a LONG way, doesn't take much to get the cleaning done.  One bottle has lasted me several years."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have had no problems using these and they work as described.  I do not like, though, that you have to hammer in the retaining tab to prevent the platform arms from coming out.  I also do not see how these are really double locking.  I wish they came with a adapter for the saddle since the saddle area is pretty big, but I knew that these weren't completely flat saddles (I made an adapter).  I would recommend them, but know what you are getting before you pull the trigger on getting them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have used a LOT of this type of equipment over the past 30+ years and this is one of the best for the price deals I have found.  I sure wish they were tad bit longer, but what can one expect?  They have a good strong cast wire and plug assembly (as pictured) and they used a very good quality wire of what looks to be at least an 18 ga wire, with good flexibility.  The alligator clips use a high quality end and should give a good long service life if not abused.  With a 3 foot lead length I assume they are designed mostly for use as a bench test lead set, but these will service any use where a 3 foot length will do the job.  Buy with confidence.... so far, I have never had a bad experience with anything from Elenco!  Not to mention that Amazon's policies will cover you if you are not satisfied..... highly likely you will NOT be disappointed.  Enjoy!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Liquid Glass is a terrific polish that goes on easily, protects for months and actually creates a deeper shine with additional coats.  I don't know if I believe the hype that many coats of Liquid Glass create a scratch resistant shell on your paint, but as a meticulous car nut, I can say that Liquid Glass is the best polish I have ever come across.  This polish goes on easily with a microfiber cloth and comes off very easily with another microfiber cloth.  It is not a wax but rather a clear acrylic coating.  I highly recommend it.PROS: Long lastingDeep, superior shineEasy to apply / buff offCan be used in sunCONS: Cannot be used over existing coats of wax/polish (unless you use LG pre-cleaner)Fairly expensiveTough to remove cured polish once appliedI posted a picture of my Liquid Glassed blue Shelby above.

Better then the dealership's 700 dollar application of Xylon on my wife's' 2014 Honda Odyssey. Make sure you clean your vehicle with the pre cleaner and do a hand check to feel for &#34;bumps&#34; of dirt or other road grim before application. This is easy to wipe off as well, so it is quicker then hand waxing for me."}

Often overlooked as routine maintenance, fuel filters can (without warning) become clogged and, in turn, lead to vehicle reliability issues. This is especially true up norh, where seasonal mixes of gasoline affect the fuel system differently. Additionally, if you utilize E-85 ethanol in your vehicle, than you should be replacing these things more frequently than you may be used to.

If neurotic about replacement or don't knowdate of last replacement, replace right away or after somelesser interval like 20,000 miles.

Then I let it sit anywhere from 30mins to overnight.

When I came out the next morning and started it the generator fired up, blew out some white smoke and ran like a champ. I let it run for an hour under full load of the A/C. The generator fires up every time now and runs great."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been using this stuff for YEARS.  It works great, it prevents the &#34;fogging&#34; on windshields, and it lasts a good long time.  And since it's not silicone based, it's not one of those cheap products that just shines up the surfaces, and dries them out so they crack.  Over years of applications in several cars an in the house, I've never had cracking issues.It will never provide a super shiny surface like the cheaper competitors, but that's not what it's for.  It's for cleaning AND protecting the surfaces."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this for years on my car dash and other vinyl areas of the interior. I always thought it worked and protected pretty well although it does evaporate on to the inside of the windshield, which is annoying. It also doesn't seem to last very long and as it starts wearing off, the dash looks very dry.I've since found303 Aerospace Protectant 32oz, and that works much better. It doesn't seem to exhibit any of the aforementioned issues, ie., it doesn't seem to go on to the inside of the windshield, and the shine lasts longer.  It also protects from UV just as well, if not better.  Note that Vinylex contains silicone, which actually damages the vinyl/plastic over time.I'm definitely sold on 303 Protectant over Vinylex now although I really like the Lexol pH leather cleaner and Lexol leather conditioner for my leather."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I put this product on after applying a paint sealant and if gives the car a very nice gloss. It is super easy to apply and remove. What I really like about it is that it does not show fingerprints at all. on my Porsche 911 it would always show fingerprints in the area of the door where we push to close the doors or trunk area, after applying the P21S it no longer shows fingerprints. Generally speaking the carnauba waxes don't last very long but that is not an issue for me since my car is pretty small and doing a full wax doesn't take me very long at all so I can apply a wax like this once a month since it is so easy to put on and remove. This is my first experience with carnauba wax and certainly won't be my last. Yes it is a bit more expensive but this container will last a very long time"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Love this!  Does what everyone says.  Puts a polish and shine that lasts 3-6 months.  Makes new cars staybright and old oxidized cars 'almost' look new.  What's great is just rub on and buff off in 15 min., and you use only a capful per 3 sq/ft.  Water beads up and rolls off, or gets blown off while driving(water flies off the windshield). Between waxing, add a capful to bucket of clean water and wash your car. MUST dry car immediately with microfiber cloths so no spots will form.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Great shipping by AMAZON and VENDOR."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The relay setup is a breeze, if you want to make things easy just connect the aux plug directly to the power plug & horn will work at all times, rather than just when the car is on. You CANNOT take the bolt off on the back, dont try to, the covers can be removed and painted with ease by removing the black screws around the bezel. Also, we cut & drilled a new hole on the bracket to place them where we wanted them & that bracket is made of reinforced Steele & took forever to drill through. Excellent product"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The reviewers here who say to remove the black lens covering are not increasing their ability to see better, only increasing the glare to other drivers.  They are also breaking the seal  and allowing water intrusion to do so, for no benefit.The light pattern of these is not ideal but for the price is fine. Mount them properly, aim them properly, and use them in conditions that warrant their use and only then, and they are an effective product.But too many use automotive lighting incorrectly, thinking that a huge blast of light is allowing them to see better, when in all actuality all it is doing is constricting their pupil sizes, and vision, and blinding oncoming traffic.I hope cops start ticketing these fools who are using auxiliary lighting improperly, or retrofitting HID bulbs into halogen housings."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I mounted these on the bumper of my Ford F250. They are about 24\" off the ground; not too close to the pavement by any means. The housings started to leak within a week or two of being installed. I removed the lights and tried sealing with black silicone, but they still leaked. Perhaps because of the leak, the chrome started flaking off within a few weeks.  I now have very good looking lights, which leak, produce nearly no helpful light, and won't stay aimed in the direction I angled them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this to replace a replacement cover. The old replacement cover was old, ripped and still smelled like the strong vinyl scent. This one is very nice. It is nice and smooth and feels good in your hands. It takes some muscle to install but once it is one there it looks good. It could be a tad cheaper but it looks well made. The stitching is solid and doesn't seem like it will come apart. It doesn't move at all once you place it on your steering wheel so you don't have to worry about that."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The item was just as discribed. Genuine Leather, it does fit sung. My wheel is a PT Crusier GT. It is leather, but it's starting to show wear. So I bought this to try? It was a bit hard to put on. So I laid it in the Sun for awhile. It went on. But don't add anything to help it along. You don't want it to slip. My Steering Wheel is 15\", but it fits like it was made for it! My secret for keeping them looking HOT, is KIWI Black shoe polish, hand rubbed. SW"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred. These covers fit well. They don't slide and they are made of real leather. You can smell the leather scent. One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather, they do make the driving experience slightly different. They do make the steering wheel thicker. No regrets, the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition. The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a great product!  It brought back the original look and actually a nice satin-gloss look to my tires.I agree with other reviews, don't care for the Ultra Glossy finish some tire dressing produce and this is a restorer... it helps the rubber.  Just be aware that this is a strong and some what dangerous product, they warn that this can cause  cancer, and as a survivor of Melanoma from last year, I take this cautions seriously!  Just follow the directions, be safe, and enjoy the look this produces!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I like this 3M Tire Restorer because it goes on easily and covers well. It leaves the tire looking great and not real shiny but like new. I don't like the really shiny tire products because it looks peculiar to see a tire that way. I prefer the matte finish where the tire looks like new and clean. I have tried lots of tire products and use this one consistently on my new truck and looks great. Also seems to last awhile. I also like the way it comes out of the spray bottle as it is a nice fan spray that covers a good area. Worth trying if you like to keep your vehicle looking like new."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been struggling for years with my lever action grease gun as you really do need a third hand to use it. I finally got fed up enough and did some research on-line and noticed the LINCOLN model had the best ratings. I love the way it locks onto a fitting and doesn't leak all round the sides of the fitting instead of going into the fitting as my old gun did....(made a mess and wasted grease) The Lincoln forces all the grease into the fitting easily...once you snap onto the fitting you only need ONE hand to operate! This is a quality piece of equipment and worth every penny especially with the best price and free shipping from Amazon. Now I wont get aggravated and talk myself out of greasing the cars and  lawn tractor as I should be.....THANK YOU LINCOLN INDUSTRIAL 1134....."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My preference was to purchase a grease gun made in the USA. Nowhere could I find one so I was resigned to buy one which I was sure would be made in China. To my surprise the gun was made in India and is a high quality item. The hose was made in Germany which was another surprise. I needed to lubricate the spindles on my mower so I obtained a grease cartridge and tried to load it into the gun by following the manual provided by Lincoln. I appreciate the fact that Lincoln furnished a manual but I would have been pleased if it had been written clearly enough to be understood. I simply could not load the cartridge using the Lincoln manual and decided to look for other instructions. Luckily I found a YouTube clip titled Lincoln Grease Gun Tutorial which solved my loading problem and offered other helpful hints. All went well after viewing that clip.This is a fine grease gun and works as expected. Other than a confusing user guide I have no complaints."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is one good grease gun.  Yeah, it's easily twice to three times what you'd spend in a big box store for a grease gun but it's solid and heavy-weight.  It probably weighs twice the weight of the gun it replaces.  It's got an air pressure release valve to purge any trapped air.  The rubber hose is longer than most and that helps getting in those hard-to-reach places.  The tip snaps securely on the zerk fitting and the hose end fitting is adjustable to get a secure connection on the zerk valve.  And the one-handed operation of the squeeze handle is a delight to use.  I just finished using it to grease the spindles and wheels of my riding mower and it worked great.This has got to be the last grease gun you'll ever buy.  You'll thank yourself every time you use it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This thing seems extremely well made, even if it isn't made in the USA. I had a cheap gun before this and blew the seals on the second use. This pumped grease into some well rusted fittings with ease.My only complaint is the hose fitting that attaches to the zerks. Yes, it is a 2 piece design as many have mentioned which is both good and bad. If you have easily accessible zerks that need a lot of pressure, you can screw this on and use both hands to pump. However, large u-joints can be a huge pain as I can't get anything in to tighten the fitting. I found I had to keep making adjustments then sticking it in the joint until I found the perfect setting where it fit on the zerk but didn't lose grease. However, there were a few joints where I was unable to find this balance and couldn't get them to take grease. I will have to buy a different hose to get them all."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless. The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Wish it were cheaper, but I won't use a product that might damage the paint on my classic - so I pay the price.  Only reason for not giving it another star is how much it costs.  Using a stretched out 2x3 inch piece of clay along with the Meguiar's Detailing Spray for lubrication makes pretty easy work for a step that I'm not that fond of doing.  I'm always shocked at how much garbage the clay picks up from what looked like a clean paint surface.  The smoothness after going over the paint shows that this stuff is working great.  Cleaning the car with soap and water is the first step, and using the clay is definitely the necessary second step before moving on to polishing and waxing."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Easy to install, setup, wire up and use.  Its nice to have one connection point and be able to plug pin what ever kind of trailer you might want to tow. It works great with my camper, snow mobile trailer, ATV trailer and my old beater gravel, dirt and construction material trailer.Installation:  If you have a 4 wire harness already installed (like I did) you can just plug into that for all the lights, blinkers and brake lights, then simply add a break controller for trailer breaking  and connect to the wiring on the multi tow adapter. It also has pass through power connections for your attached trailer- which is great for charging your camper batteries while driving down the road.  We used this feature all summer while dry camping (camping with out plug in power) all over the midwest United States."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "it's usefully to get a wire off the ground, but it's pretty thick, and it set up for round tube, like a class III/IV, and not a square class I so it wasn't going to be easy to install, and be functional. i ended up installing the plug in trunk, and will have to have it come out that way, disapointing, but it works better that where i'd have to put it.it's easily 2x the thickness of the plug, and 2x as long. the plug will stick out a bit. if i had round tube, a self tapping screw would have worked well."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Works well as a way to adapt our car's 7 blade trailer hookup to also work on our 4 wire bicycle trailer. The LEDs are particularly appreciated, as a way of ensuring proper functioning of trailer lighting to at least that point. The rubber cover for the 4 contacts is also much appreciated.Our lawn mower once ran over this, damaging it enough that we bought another, though the original does still work - despite no longer being quite all there.My only other suggetion is that it's not always obvious in the dark which side goes up, though it does eventually only fit one way.Recommended!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out, and so does this Adapter. But I really wouldn't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well, with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector, aligning all the pins correctly. It's a tight fit so that it won't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I don't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested.  Frankly, I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway, with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works.  I presume the LEDs will tell me if there's an issue some day."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this to change my front brakes recently. I had never used a tool like this before. I've always just used a C-Clamp on the caliper. This tool was very simple to use. You just put an old brake pad on the caliper piston, stick the tool in the caliper, and turn the knob. The tool feels sturdy enough to last through many brake jobs. It is easy to use. It was a little more difficult for my car because it has 2 piston front brake calipers, so I had to go back and forth in the caliper to make sure that both pistons got compressed. It still was not hard to use, it just took a few minutes longer.I am very pleased. I would buy this again, but based on how this felt when using it, I don't think I will have to."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Had my 13 yr old car painted and the  body shop said no waxing for 90 days to let the paint out gas. I live in FL with bug season and water spots from washing and general dirt abound. Called Meguries and this stuff is body shop safe. Which means it will let the new paint out gas. I have been using it with excellent results between washes. Once the 90- days are up I will use a permeate wax.For really tough bug stains I use DP Detailers road kill bug remover and then the final inspection to bring the shine back. On very light bug splats the Final inspection works fine."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff works pretty well at removing light swirls and scratches.  They take seconds to get in your clearcoat and hours to remove if done properly.There were some deep defects that were diminished but I didnt want to burn through the clear as I have not done paint repair before.  This is the Pro version of Swirlx and I tried them side by side and this works better than Swirlx.  Maybe its the placebo effect but most of the swirls are gone without any damage to the paint using a cheap Harbor freight DA polisher and their orange compounding pad.  I did follow this up with Ultimate polish then Mirror glaze for a really good black finish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've used the Meguiar's professional line for years and couple them with the Meguiars pads used on a Porter Cable 7424 random orbital polished.  Results are outstanding.  This time, I had to rescue the finish from an incompetent transport company that wiped down the car dry trying to be &#34;helpful&#34; leaving it a mass of swirl marks.  Even this wasn't abrasive enough to remove them, had to go the low cut cleaner first then this polish and all is right with the world.  Two potential problems with this product - if you use an orbital polisher that isn't random, you'll likely burn through your paint if you are not a pro.  Second, DO NOT let the product dry before wiping off and when wiping off, a very damp cloth helps a lot.  Change the cloth (micro fiber preferred) frequently (I use about a dozen to do a small Mazda Miata as they will load up quickly).  Use the product sparingly - a little does a lot."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "First off, don't get turned off by the name, Yellow is the color of the stuff, it won't turn your paint yellow!  It does look great on yellow paint though, also reds and darker colors like dark blue and black.  For lighter colors you are better off going with something else, Collinite 845 is a great choice.Pros:-DRIPPY wet looks.  You'll want to grab a towel and dry your paint, its that wet!-Decent durability, approx 2-3 months on a car parked outdoors-Fills in minor swirling-Leaves paint nice and slickCons:-Stains trim (rubber, black plastic)-Needs to be applied very thin, otherwise it can be hard to take off-Can streak if used on a hot surface or if too much is usedOverall, this is a great wax that has been around for a very long time because it looks so great.  its a total steal at the price."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Meguiar's has a reputation of making excellent car care products and this one is no exception. It goes on and comes off easy. I applied their sealer on my new Caddy and then followed it with this wax. (All by hand.) It looks amazing. The shine is so bright it almost hurts. It really pulled out the color of the paint. It gave a depth that I didn't see when it came from the dealer. It looks like a candy apple red after the Meguiar's treatment. It looks so good I'm almost afraid to drive it. :)This is supposed to be long lasting wax, so my plan is to only wax once a year. I'll provide an update if there are any changes."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have had this cap wrench for 20 years, I first bought it for my 1993 Tercel. It worked on the metal canister oil filters of the Tercel and it also works on my 2012 Camry 4 cyl as well. I cannot understand the large number of reviews stating that this wrench broke - how tight are the oil filters they are removing??? I cannot imagine this one breaking if the oil filter is installed properly. The only complaint I have is it sticks to the filter housing (both the metal filter of the 1993 Tercel and plastic housing on the 2012 Camry) so you have to rock it back and forth with your ratchet to get it off."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way. With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day. I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit. Well worth the cash if you ask me."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This item is primarily used for REMOVAL, not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand. The half-circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn. The tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer. Each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes.  I used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle. I probably won't have to use it ever again. In 40 years of DIY oil changes across a couple dozen different cars, I've never had a leak by simply hand-tightening the canister to the mount."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have a zerk fitting that is in a difficult spot.  Be sides that the standard coupler wouldn't fit, I couldn't hit the zerk fitting head on either.  I have to go in at a slight angle, which made this job a real challenge.I bought two other types of adapters from local auto parts stores without any success.One was the rubber tip, and the other was 4\" needle adapter.  Both failed.  Rubber tip couldn't hold the pressure, leak grease around the rubber edge.  The 4\" needle adapter was too long and the tip angle was too wide.Bought Lincoln needle nozzle next and it was perfect for this.  The tip was narrow, sharper angle, and the right length.  It fits on my grease pump without any problems.  I was really happy that I got the ball joint greased up.  I would buy this again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This fluid evacuator leaks around the top cover, both under vacuum and pressure. After taking the cover off it is apparent that the o-ring seal is too small to make up the gaps in the wavy top surface of the cylinder. I will keep it and make it work, most likely with silicone, but that sort of defeats the fluid dispensing function, as I will not be able to thoroughly clean the container without sealing it up with new silicone each time.The fact that it can be used for pressure or vacuum is good. The pump and associated plumbing works great, just a poor design for the cover seal."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After I replaced the old faded headlights on my 2000 Ford CVPI, I noticed that they needed to be adjusted. I called a \"local and official\" state lamp adjusment shop and they quoted me $80 to adjust the two new headlamp assemblies I bought on E-Bay for $50. Right. So I tried to adjust them myself but it was very difficult and time consuming. I bought this tool from a local Napa Auto Parts store. The tool worked OK but unfortunately because the head is so big, it would only turn to a certain extent before being stopped by the other metal piece to the rear of the headlamp assembly unit. Another reviewer below mentioned the same problem. So in the end, the tool was really useless because I could not use it to completely turn the small screws all the way back towards the rear. Ford made such a poor design of their frame that I cannot believe how hard it was to change out my bulbs and headlamp assembly much less adjust them properly."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "And you're probably wondering what happened to the first one... very simple-- someone &#34;acquired it&#34; one fateful day. With that I was in need of getting another pair and after looking at the designs that are out there, I went with the same one that I had. What is nice is that it has a flat that when you crimp down on the ears it helps flatten it out so it is not a big bump. This definitely helps in preventing the clamp from coming apart or becoming misaligned too much while you are squeezing it. There is not much to say except that this one is exactly like my last one and I like the way it works."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "You can't beat these tools in ease of replacing tie rod ends.  I haven't tried the pitman arm puller or the ball joint tool yet, but if they're anything like the tie rod tools, they'll make your life way easier.  Don't mess around with those pickle stabbers, get a real set of tools and make your life easier.  They're beefy enough to work on everything the &#34;home mechanic&#34; can throw at them, and it's really refreshing when you can take a tie rod end off with barely a twist of a wrench.  They come in a nice case too!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It is apparently well made.  Works as you would expect.  Mine reads between 1 and 2lbs higher than the pressure compared with my racing gauge in the 29lb - 44lb range.  It is marked in 2lb increments but seems to bounce around a bit.  wouldn't count on getting closer than within 2 of your desired pressure with this unit.  It is good for filling past your point, knowing you are there,  then use a more accurate gauge and let air down to the exact pressure you seek.  For lots of uses it will be fine just to go with this tool and accept the +/- 2 lbs or so of error."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it."}

If you want to air something up and recheck it with you .50 air gauge or your 30.00 Snap-on air gauge that was certified and find the numbers are off then don't buy this. If you like me, average Joe, that uses it to check tire pressure, air kids basketballs, and around the house airing jobs, I have had 2 in my life this is the 2nd in 40 years and they both work perfect for these needs and have never failed.

{"label": 2, "raw": "The only flaw that kept me from leaving a 5-star rating is the \"inaccurate\" gauge.. Everything else works great & the inflator unit itself is built with quality material designed to withstand heavy use.After having read other's review here, I caliberated this Milton S-506 gauge against a high end digital gauge that I use on my passenger vehicles & the reading from this gauge is consistantly 4 psi lower.I bought this gauge for my Chevy DuraMax Dually, so I simply inflate the tires up to 64 psi in order to achieve 60 psi pressure on all the tires.So word to the wise, caliberate it against a better, more precise gauge first before you put it to use, this way you'll know how much to \"offset\" before you rely on it completely.Overall, it is an excellent value."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a nice, sturdy guage to check spark plug gap.  However, it has only an inch scale, with no metric equivalent on the reverse side.  So if you plan on gapping your plug to a metric value, forget this guage.  Even so, it felt good to use and not at all flimsy.  It's smoothly finished and the marking are clear and legible, making it easy to read.  Well worth what I paid for it.PS. Another reviewer said the one he received had the metric markings on the back side.  I found no such markings on mine -- perhaps the one I received was defective.  In any event, that doesn't alter my rating.  I still like it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Measured my front and rear tires.  Front 6/32, rear 8/32.  Time to rotate.Accuracy is cleaverly done by putting the numbers around the barrel so accuracy is increased because numbers are spread apart.  Mechanically simple and small to fit in glove commpartment.Can't imagine any advantage to paying more for such a simple tool when this one works so well.  Quality is medium but more than sufficient for this purpose.  Only a few measurements needed for tires.  This tools is the one to buy."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Got this to try to extend the life on my motorcycle tires by adjusting the air to keep the tread depth similar on the middle of the tire and on the sides. It appears I was running too much air and the middle tread was wearing faster than the sides. The gauge is simple and straight forward, however, the scale goes around the cylinder that goes in and out, so if you measure tread depth at one point on the tire, you have to turn the gauge around to read tread depth at another point on the tire if it is more, or less, than the first reading. Also, while you can &#34;guestimate&#34; the depth (good enough for personal use) by reading the lines on the gauge, I would just go for one of the digital depth gauges if I had to buy one again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just want to say thank you to milton for making a METAL tread depth gauge. I hate those little plastic ones. The best part about it is the numbers on the gauge are recessed, stamped, into the metal. So even if the black ink were to come off (hasnt come off ater a few years) you can still read the numbers. A little bit of lubrication with some silicone or rust penetrant helps keep it sliding smooth, and if you dont, it rusts up and makes it really rough and may even give some strange tread depth readings. The pintle is quite strong (used it as a screwdriver on a desperate situation once) and the ink is long lasting."}

How is that possible, when new it is only 13/32??  If that were the case, I'm sure Yokohama woul dbe hunting me down to steal those tires,lolThis Milton tread gauge is very basic and it works!!  No batteries to worry about. It does feel a tad greasy when you touch it. I just keep it in a ziploc bag in my trucks cub hole!!  Too easy!!  Don't let the low price fool you, it works!!"}

If it's full of things it's alright, but it's totally soft sided with nothing really giving any shape to it, so if you don't have it full enough to hold its shape, it's going to start to fall in on itself.The mesh pockets on the outsides are alright but easy to get things stuck in that mesh.  I would've liked a couple of the open top pouches to be solid sides to facilitate holding different things.For the price, though, as long as you are going to keep stuff in it to help it hold its shape, it's a decent deal.  Not much you can find that's bigger than a visor organizer for under $20..."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I drive an older SUV that has a lot of plastic on the outside. The plastic trim had lost it's color and looked sun damaged and pretty terrible. At first, \"back to black\" didn't sound like what I needed, since the plastic I needed to treat was grey, not black. But, I read about this stuff on another website, and it can be used for all sorts of plastics/vinyls etc., not just black color. Anyway, this stuff really works. My car is looking much better now. I did the first coat and it is looking very good. I'll follow up with another coat soon, and hopefully it will look even better!"}

I tried numerous products and while many would restore the black, the color would eventually fade and I would be right back to where I started. I ordered this Mother's product and applied that to my fenders. I was very surprised at the amount of color restoration I got from applying two or three coats. The black did return and my fenders looked great. I have now been driving the vehicle about three months and I still have nice looking fenders. I also used the polish on my black running boards and the end caps on both the front and rear bumpers. All received the polish well and color looks good. It is easy to apply and then wife. Don't leave the polish on too long after drying as it will be more difficult to polish."}

The Powerball saved my hands, and this Micro-Polish and Glaze made the white surface of my car reflect like a mirror.  You can't see the micro scratches easily on a white car, but you could see how smooth the surface was, and you could feel it.  I followed up with 3 coats of the Step 3 wax, and the car looks showroom new.  There is enough left in the bottle, after doing my full-size car, for at least another full-size car.  Good value!"}

However, if you have a lousy paint job don't waste your money.This product is for people who can afford the best finishes and want to  sit around and get classy-eyed and polish their cars trying to impress someone. No machines. You need a microfiber towel and keep flipping it over  to get a really nice glare.I don't care what is in the stuff. It shows a noticeable difference. I care more about what beer I'll drink doing the job."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have been using this for years, and it is hands down the best quick detailer on the market. Products like Meguiars Ultimate Detailer are more of a spray wax type product rather than a detailer, as they withstand car washes. However, those products cannot be used on fresh paint, and they are a bit harder to apply/remove than the Mothers Showtime (which is safe for fresh paint - confirmed with Mothers). Not to mention it has a great smell, provides a deep shine, and fills in light swirl marks. The 24oz version from Amazon is a great deal, and if you try it, you won't be disappointed. The same goes for any Mothers product, actually."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The good news is that this is easy to spray on and wipe off. The spray handle gives a fine mist that covers a good area. The spray wipes off easily. The bad news is that the shine is not much better than if I had just washed it and left it. Maybe it will get better over time as the coating builds up. It also streaks a bit but this is minimized if you use a good microfiber cloth.  It's good stuff but doesn't give me the kind of shine I would get from a regular wax job."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used Mothers California Gold Clay Bar to clean my car's paint before using DA polisher.  I washed my car two times and then used Mother's clay bar.  Even after two washes, when I ran my hand on the paint to feel the surface before and after claying I could feel the difference.  After claying the paint was appreciably smoother.The application was very easy - just spray the included solution and slide the bar on the paint, knead the clay when it smudges appear.  The box warns that if the bar is dropped it has to be discarded, so I was mindful of not dropping it and I did not.  It was quite easy to hold and use.The only thing I did not like about this product is that the solution smelled like cinnamon.  I am not a fan of cinnamon and that smell is unpleasant to me.Overall, this is a great product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I enjoyed using this product on my vehicle. Looks and feels much smoother.I spent some time working on the entire car. It took a lot longer than the 30-45 minutes people have been posting.The \"Mothers Clay Bar System\" did remove most of the debris off of the surface, but it did leave behind dots of tree sap, and some tar that kicked up on the side of my car. (I did work on it extensively attempting to remove everything.) The system worked well for me, just not up to the hype I had read about.I noticed a big difference in drying off my car now. Before a microfiber towel would stick, now it glides!If you want to spend sometime with your car I would recommend it. Don't expect miracles.Hope this reviews helps!Thanks for reading it! :)"}

So I bought another black car but this time I searched you tube for car care and found things about &#34;claying&#34; your car. I thought &#34;no way&#34; I'm going to rub a bar of clay on my black car, that would just scratch it to death. Well I was wrong, even after a good cleaning there is still dirt particles in the paint, just do the plastic bag test and you will see. I used the clay bar as instructed and it deep cleaned the surface and in turn I could seal the paint after the claying job. It does an amazing job on cleaning your paint. I have used it to remove scuff marks, bird doo, bugs, about anything that is on your paint."}

The spray has a Cinnamon smell to it, its not bad but For people who don't like Cinnamon I feel sorry for you,k But I would use this None the Less.It pulls the contaminates off the car and yes you can hear it, it does help remove tar, bugs can be stubborn but do come off. Make sure you use plenty of spray and don't push hard, you need to glide across the paint."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you have never used a clay bar on your car, this is going to blow your mind.  It is very easy to use, and only takes a few minutes - but yields the most amazing results.  The clay bar pulls the dirt (after a regular wash) from the paint and leaves a totally smooth mirror-like finish.  I've been using the Mother's version for a few years and each clay bar can last a dozen or so uses before it needs to be replaced - unless you drop it on the ground.  The spray is essentially very light soap water, but it provides all the lube you need.  I usually add this into the three step process after washing and polishing, but before waxing.You will simply not belive the before and after difference you will feel when running your fingers across the paint.Also works great on glass."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My wife parked under a tree that left tiny sap particles all over the car (a 2011 VW Sportwagen). I've tried using mineral spirits which did nothing so I tried this. While it didn't make the car perfect, it made a very noticeable improvement. Had I not dropped one of the bars on the ground and immediately discarded it, I think I could have made an even better improvement. I was careful not to press too hard, but I did use some pressure. As others noted, this did cause some very faints scratches which were easily removed with wax."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a great clay bar kit at a good price. It comes with everything you'll need. 2 clay bars should be sufficient if you've never clay bar'd your car before, 1 is enough if you do so periodically (1-2 years). Awesome super smooth finish on your car removes pitted particulate and some swirls, but it does require good amount of elbow grease for great results!The application spray has this nice cinnamon scent to it, but I still don't think that that means it's good for you to keep inhaling it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The clay bar is excellent, works wonders at removing all the little bits of grit and grime and leaving a mirror smooth-to-the-touch finish. The detailer and microfiber cloth are a bonus, however any quick detailer will work just fine for using the clay bar. I used the clay bar for the first time on my brand new Shelby GT500 which had a bit of grime built up from the trip from the factory to the dealer. I love how it felt after I was done. So smooooooth. I will definitely be using it often and will order another one of these in the future when I need to."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion."}

Avoid at all costs."}

It takes a lot of rubbing against the scratch.It appears to be doing more harm than good, adding scratches to my fairly dark vehicle.  I'm using it by hand with a foam applicator, which never has scratched my finish when waxing.  I find the results of a good coat of wax do a better job and don't add additional swirlmark scratches like this stuff.  It may work better with a power buffer.  By hand, it's pretty useless."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use it to keep the clear lexan cover on my squad car light bar maintained.

The container tube is good quality and has not cracked and split open like some other brands I've used.  They even put a hole in the base of the tube so you can hang it on a nail on the garage wall (or on a chain around your neck, I suppose).On paint???  Outstanding!!  I think you'll be pleased."}

I was able to remove all the surface scratch on my trunk and it looks good as new!The scratch on the chrome molding and taillight was too deep and couldn't be removed.

I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great. I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color. Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue. Nothing really deep. After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire. It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun. There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results. The water also beads very nice, too."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years.  The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze.  You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily.  Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You don't need to apply much, just enough to cover the surface.  Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting.  Also I use it on chrome, chromed plastic, etc."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've owned this wax for some time.  It doesn't last more than a month - if that. It's a pain to put on and take off.  It goes on ok, but taking it off is another story, leaves a almost a oily residue until you wash your car, or use numerous towels/microfiber to take it off.  How much do you really want to rub your paint to get the residue off (I have black paint)?  I haven't really seen any good protection from the elements or from birds/bugs.  One postitive is that it does smell good when applying it but I'm sure Meguiars added the fragrance for some marketing perspective.  All in all, for the price compared to durability - this stuff is a waste and not sure why Meguiars even put it on the market."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product is easy to apply and easy to wipe off.  But, on black cars especially, it does not give a nice deep glossy or \"wet look\" shine.  It leaves more of a streaky oily finish.I switched over to yellow carnuba wax and the difference was night and day.  I have a full bottle that I no longer use and it's just sitting in the garage collecting dust.If you have a black car, and stick with carunba wax instead of synthetics. Meguiar's to make great products, but this one fails to impress.I get a better shine off of Meguiar's cleaner wax than this NXT stuff.But a friend introduced me to Mothers pure carnuba wax and I have since made a switch in brand.  I mean the shine you get with this stuff is just insane."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have a Porter Cable 7336SP dual action polisher with the backing pad and the Meguiar's 6.5 inch pads fit perfectly and securely. I like these pad very much. I use Meguiar's Ultimate Polish with this pad to remove minor swirls and minor scratches on the clean coat of my car. I place product on the pad, lay it on the car and turn on the polisher so as not to sling product. The Porter Cable 7336 polisher is not the most powerful, so when I first begin polishing, the machine rotates the pad when I don't add much pressure. However, as the product becomes loaded with wet polish, the pad begins to drag and loses its rotation. It helps that the pad is not &#34;so&#34; thick and that the edges are tapered. I've solved the problem by having a second pad to change out to finish the second half of the vehicle. The pads are easy to clean and I let them dry with the Velcro pad facing up.

I only had one pad and had to wash it after using Mirror Glaze and before using NXT Wax. I attached the wet pad to the DA polisher and turned it on to spin the water out of the pad.

It does not leave any grease feel which is important in a convertible in the summer when dust will stick if there is any type of residue like that left over. I use it once a week after a wash just to keep the appearance up. I'm going to try it on my leather couches inside the house instead of buying the kit that they sold me with the setup which dried out quickly. Meguiars goes on quick and comes off easy. Nice Product!They also sell products that separate these into two separate bottles. So far, I'm not changing.

It makes my DIY fluid changes and inspections MUCH easier and quicker.I have a 2005 Mazda 3, and I have absolutely no problems with it sliding, moving, or touching when I drive up on it.Although my car is not even half the weight of the 8000lb capacity model, I bought the 12000lb version just to be on the safe side.I've had this product for just under a year, and I use it every 4 - 5 weeks.

Just a dab goes and goes.One caviat, use an old T-shirt to polish with and whatever cloth you use do not plan on washing grey to black remains out of the cloth.  No big deal.Bought a gorgous old Navy brass 8\" bell with lots of tarnish.  Looked pretty good with the old patena but even better with the bright shine Simicrome put on it.

No success at all.  Again pulled out the mother's,,,,although slow and tedious, it did the job with no damage to ceramic coating.Screw on lid on mother's makes far better sense.  Semichrome lid requires an inconvenient  pry tool to remove,,,,which tends to clobber lid causing it to not seal well.  Additionally semichrome is somewhat on the order as twice as expensive.  I should have purchased a tube instead of a can to give it a try,,,would have saved 15 or so dollars."}

If you can find the old Brasso in the metal can grab it! Its the old formula made prior to the VOC regulation changes and it is amazing. Simichrome paste is pretty damn close to Brasso if not better."}

I did it both vents but never emptied the can. Then ran the blower. It wasn't until a few days later when the weather was typically that which would make me notice the musty smell but it wasn't there!!

As far as the cleaning part goes, I'm not impressed with that either.I would not recommend this product to a friend unless it was $5 to $6 bucks cheaper."}

Does a fairly good job of taking off scuffs and such. It doesn't seem to attract dust, so flat trim looks better longer.A little goes a long way. I find I use about a quarter as much of this as I do the other protectants when doing my interior. Given this, while it isn't cheap, it really ends up costing less over the long term."}

It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This little product has its place, but I don't think in its present form that it can replace road flares.  The idea is a good one, and with a little tweaking, the product might be a great item for an emergency road kit.  If they made the flare bigger, larger light emitting head, and light from all sides, I think they would have a winner.  In its current form, it is too small and too lightweight to be of much use.  One would need several, and at almost $10 each, that would be expensive.  I think a couple of them in a glove box might be a good idea, but no replacement for a huge flashlight and some road flares.A good idea but needs work."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This may be something that would be nice to have in your emergency pack, but it is small, toylike and not really functional as a \"flare\"  The light that is generated is bright in both the flash and continous shine mode, but the light is directional.  It projects basically in one direction as opposed to being a genuine flare style that projects in a 360 degree radius.  For a carry-around for emergency use it would provide some help, but I think there are better flameless flares on the market that would work better.  This is a lower cost item, so you may want to consider that when you make a comparison.  I give it three out of 5 stars but I can't recommend it to anyone who may consider this to be a complete emergency flare solution."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I measured it at 500 feet in the dark.  It is clearly visable.  But headlights will wash it out as some point as a car approaches it.  And if there are lights beyond your vehicle it may get lost.  However, it is inexpensive and certainly better than leaving your emergency blinkers on if you are going to be away for long enough for them to drain your battery.  I wouldn't buy just one per vehicle.  I'd buy several.  The magnetic feature is very handy.  But the key is getting your vehicle off the road as far as possible so emergency lighting is not as important.  If you can't I'd use emegegency flashers and get back to your vehicle ASAP.  And forget about using this during the day.  You can't see it from far enough away to avoid an accident."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1\" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a \"vanity\" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I needed to replace my front tag holder and figured that I would like to have something that people just can't come up with a screwdriver and take it off. Granted you can take one look at it and pick up a hollow star key / wrench and take it off but at least it make it a little harder for the drive by plate theft. I gave this 4 starts only because of the construction of the Allen key like wrench which comes with the set. Instead of having the key portion in the short end so that you have the leverage of the long when you tighten the screws down but instead the key portion is in the tip of the long end so that you only have about one inch of tool to tighten the screws with so if they're tight, you'll end up like me with a box end wrench looped over the tool to complete the job. I still recommend this product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I decided to try these out, and I'm glad I did! The black ones look really god in combination with the carbon fiber license plate frame I also got from Amazon -REAL 100% CARBON FIBER LICENSE PLATE FRAME TAG COVER FFSince most plates only use two screws, one set covers front and rear (If you are lucky enough to live where a front plate is required)The white ring mounts like a washer under your mounting screws, and the black cap just snaps over the top. Seems to hold well enough to not fall off, but they pull of easily if you have to get to your screws. Another reviewer mentioned that they trap water in and rusted his mounting hardware. That is good to know. I would suggest going with stainless steel mounting hardware just in case. (Which isn't a bad idea anyway)"}

I put loop tape on the back and placed it on my dash and loaded it with 2 Amazon AAA batteries.  It has two flashing LEDs that alternated and really attracts attention.  Although it does have an on-off switch I left it on 24/7 for a Month and it's still going strong. Much longer than I expected.It is visible in the daytime so long as it's not 'directly' in the sun.Quite happy with this, good product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I'm a little disappointed in Hi-Lift Jack. Top is 2 piece and welded in the middle. Should have been one piece. They supplied a bolt rather than some sort of quick release pin to attach it. A bolt with a hand tightened nut will vibrate loose during transport. The hook on the bottom could have been a little deeper to grab onto other items other than round bumpers more securely. All in all a good add-on for your Hi-lift jack but it could have been designed a little better."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "A very simple concept but someone had to be the first to invent it. I suspect others will soon imitate this.Photos show lifting tires. No doubt it would work fine for that - especially with heavy, over size tires (as shown) or farm equipment tires. But it's good for so much more.A piece of steel under the corner of a small building, set hooks under the steel, and lift the building for re-leveling. Hook it under a mower deck of a riding mower to remove/sharpen blades.You trust your jack, now trust the accessories they provide so you can get the most from it. Be sure to get the base for the jack, better than carrying around a piece of 2x6 and no one will toss it on your camp fire, either."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "You can use this bad boy as a base for your Wrangler's bottle jack - especially if your lift kit has put the axles a tad out of reach. If you have a Discovery, you will need to Dremel out small notch for the OEM bottle jack.  High Lift jacks are great accessories, but they're not all that safe for changing tires in the field when you think about it.  For that, a bottle jack with a good base and an axle lift point will get you going just fine."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I recommend this oil to all Harley owners. I have extensively researched what motor oil to run in my 2006 Sportster 883 and decided to go with Mobil 1 V-Twin. This is the same oil weight as the Harley &#34;formula&#34; stuff, only you don't have to go to the dealer to get it. I firmly believe this makes my bike run better and it has been proven to run Harley's cooler. I run my bike hard in the Texas heat and conventional oils would break down and turn black after only ~1,200 miles or so; I won't make that mistake again as I won't have that problem with Mobil 1. I also use this as my primary fluid on the Sporty. Simply drain the primary oil and drop in a quary of Mobil 1 and you're back out riding with superior protection.KEEP IN MIND THAT A CASE OF THESE MAY COST MORE THAN ORDERING INDIVIDUAL BOTTLES SO CHECK BOTH PRICES BEFORE BUYING"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After a few cycles using the HD SYN3 oil, I decided to change my own oil and use this Mobil 1 in the engine.  Having never been satisfied with the \"just after the oil change feeling\" with SYN3, there was a noticeable improvement in engine smoothness and reduction in engine noise during the next 2,500 miles I kept this oil in the bike.  These are things you notice when you become connected to your bike, as you fellow bikers know.  I have used Mobil 1 since because of this experience and because I can get it from Amazon cheap.  It's probably not as good as AIMSOIL, but it's very good and I'm confident it's doing a great job."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Our BMW came with run-flat tires and no room for a spare.  Those run flats were noisier, wore out faster, and rode rougher than the non-run flat version of the same tire.  They were also much more expensive.  We swapped to those non-run-flat tires but worried about finding a roofing nail or bad pothole in the road one day and regretting it.Thanks to this kit we no longer have to worry.  I've used slime in other cars before an it outperforms fix-a-flat easily.  Its a little harder to put in than the competitor but you can keep this in your car year-round and you couldn't do that with an aerosol can.This kit can help provide peace of mind for you whether you keep it in your car, your spouse's car, your kid's car, or wherever."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had K&N; filters before on BMW cars in the early 2000s, despite all sorts of warnings about it can damage mass air flow (MAF) meter. Love them because they do give that extra-something to the engine during acceleration.K&N; now assures public that its tests were accepted by major car manufacturers, and that it will not void any warranty by the dealer service centers. That obviously speaks volumes. I got this for a recent model Sienna V6 and it fits fine. Look forward to save money over the lifetime while increase engine performance a bit."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is my third K&N; filter that I had purchased. When Amazon had a sale, I immediately bought a third for my 05 Camry. I also have filters for my 2007 Highlander and 1997 Chevy G3500. They all have given me smoother acceleration and a 10% increase in fuel economy. I went from 19-20MPG to 22-23MPG. It's only a couple MPG, but it really adds up in the long run. I wasn't expecting massive gains, because as other reviewers have said, if these filters gave significant increases in MPG, all the Car manufacturers would be installing these as standard or creating their own versions.As for the horsepower increase claim, I would only know if I put the car on a Dyno, so I can't say if there's a difference.Overall, worth the buy if you don't want to keep buying new disposable filters."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is actually my second K&N; filter purchase for the same vehicle.  I find it easier to have two so I can quickly swap them out and have the car ready to go while I wash, clean and more importantly let dry the other filter.  I've never had any issues with this filter, been using it on my 08 Toyota Highlander V6 for over 50k miles so far.  I have cleaned the MAF twice as part of my routine maintenance procedure using CRC Mass Air Flow Cleaner.  The stuff works like a charm.  Use this filter on the 08 Highlander 3.5 V6 with confidence, just my opinion of course!Note: this is a tight fit for the my vehicle, so please make sure you have some patience.  Tip:  Disconnect the main intake hose first (loosen the collar with a 10mm socket).  and then remove all of the mini vacuum hoses and then loosen the two 10mm lid screws.  The whole top should come free."}

The blue magic stuff generally leaves my leather feeling a bit dry and not slick. I usually apply to leather then leave it to sit for 15 minutes before applying leather conditioner. It gets rid of dirt smudges quite well without leaving much of a spot like you see if cleaning with water.I've also tried this on leather shoes. It helped remove a few minor scuffs (probably just dirt). but bigger scuffs do remain. Should always follow with leather conditioner."}

Test your paint surface for roughness (everyone's has some) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint.  If it feels rough, which it should, then Meguiar's Clay Detailer is the cure!  Using the spray as a lubricant, the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which cannot be removed by washing alone (tar, etc.).  I love it!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This duster is very handy to clean up your car or truck. It is a fairly large wand that has treated fibers that attract and hold the dust so you can quickly clean your dash, seats and any surface in your vehicle. Dust sticks to the fibers so you are not just stirring up the dust you are collecting it.I like it because I don't have to spray any cleaner and wipe it all up.  This is much faster.  They say you should not wash it as it will remove the treatment from the fibers so I just shake the duster off when I am done.  I can't stand a dusty dirty car and I want to make it look nice and protect my investment.  This duster works quickly and doesn't scratch your car's interior.  The tapered and flat dusting wand even reaches into tight spaces like along the front of your dash against the front window.I like mine and use it all the time!"}

After  a few days I am noticing some dusts are beginning to collect on my dash.  So I wanted to start using this duster.  After opening it brand new out of the blister pack, I used it on my dash and it left a trail of lint on my dash and door panel.  I thought the duster is chemically treated so that it should \"Pick UP\" dust instead of leaving \"LINT\"?  Now I am not sure if I would ever use this again...."}

When paired with a small USB inverter, I can get the full 140 watts from it, instead of the 100 watts available through my cigarette lighter.The cables are of middle thickness, but are smooth and well constructed. The clamps are secure when attached to battery posts, and easy to remove. The length is a bit on the spare side, but I understand that these cables cannot be too long and still provide useful electrical  juice.

I will post up once I have a few miles on them in the dead of dark!Update July 2013.  I love these lights and they are still going strong.  Excellent white light for dark, dark country road driving.

A single horn that wasn't very loud and would easily get lost on the highway - and it's amazing how many people are unable to see that bright yellow SUV so a horn that works is cruicial to my survival.  The PIAA horns dropped in with very little work - the FJ is wired for a second horn, so all you need are a couple of electrical tips, about 3 feet of copper wire, and a 10mm bolt and you can put the pair of these in front of your radiator where they'll do the most good - most other cars, I suspect, will have similarly easy installations.  The difference in volume was immediately noticeable.  They're not train horns, and they won't make your ears bleed, but they're appropriately loud car horns that install easily."}

Wait a day or two to completely dry and lightly polish with this compound & soft cloth. You'd be happy with the result."}

Recently I put it on the battery on my daily driver and the charge light didn't come on. Testing on several other batteries seems its lost its status lights and all its regulation and just puts out a constant 15 volts now cooking whatever battery I hook it up to. Their tech support was rude and unknowledgeable. Of course their warranty is a joke since it will cost 50% of its value just to make use of their warranty. I considered buying another but with so many other choices now on the market I can't rationalize the battery tenders high price. I replaced it with a Vector for the same price which has twice the features."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have a 2000 Mustang GT convertible that I keep garaged and drive on nice,sunny days. I had been using a cheap trickle charger from Harbor Freight. Recently I discovered the battery had died so I decided it was time for a &#34;real&#34; charger. The reviews were great so I decided to give it a try. It is a small but powerful unit. It took  my battery from stone dead  to a full charge within 24 hours and it automatically maintains a full charge. It uses LED lights to let you know the status of your battery. I wish it had a gauge instead of the lights but I still would highly recommend this to friends and family."}

It didn't get to a full charge so when we got back I put it back on until the green light came on. Then I stuck it on the other car. I plan to use this once a week on both cars.

My vehicles and generator don't get used very often, so i'm really hoping this product extends the life and performance of my batteries. Since it has arrived, I've been very impressed with it's performance. This product is much smaller and safer than any other charger/tender I've yet to come across. Keep in mind that this is a trickle charger, charging only 1.25amps per hour, so it does take some time to properly charge a battery. As the instructions annotate, it will NOT charge a totally dead battery (for safety reasons). This is defined as a battery with 3V or less charge, per the manual. It goes on to explain that when this is the case, the battery is likely defective and needs to be tested/replaced. Overall, very happy with this purchase. Only thing that could've made me happier would be if it was made in America."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you have one of the millions of GM pick ups with the base mirrors these are a reasonable add on for towing.  They are easy to install after some practice.  Easy to remove - not sure why some other reviewers had problems with this...  Just unscrew the clamp and slide them off.  They are a little tough to adjust because you need to move the mirror beyond where you want it and let it snap back a bit. Just takes a little time.  Once adjusted they stayed put. They are stable on the highway but on bumpy roads they cause my OEM mirror glass to vibrate more than the add ons.  This is probably due to the extra weight of these.  You will definitely want to take them off when you are not towing.  They make your truck look like Dumbo and people will bump them in parking lots.  Best price by far was Amazon when I bought them."}

It wasn't bad, but it was noticable.I would have taken them off after each trip, but the installation (although not overly difficult) was not easy enough for me to do so every day.As for functionality, the mirror is a little small, and although it DID give me increased visiblity, it wasn't quite what I was expecting.Maybe I was expecting too much from this mirror, but I couldn't bring myself to give it 5-stars.  I'll keep using them (especially since the chrome is already scuffed!!!), but this isn't a 5-star item."}

The first two trips I just connected up the hoses to the Y connected and then had to \"milk\" the contents into the sewer.  This was not fun.  This product almost completely eliminates that horrible process and keeps things flowing downhill.  I actually purchased two - one for each sewer connection.  This keeps the elevation correct to the Y connector.  After that, the site was pretty level, so there wasn't much of a problem.I've only used these once, so I cannot comment on longevity, but I would likely replace them if they break sooner than later."}

I believe it helps, but honestly I haven't done a &#34;taste test&#34; of a campground's water with and without the filter (maybe I should...?).  I also use this to tank up our onboard water storage when I am using it.  NOTE:  You will want to run water through the filter for several minutes before hooking it up to clear out the carbon dust.  It looks disconcerting to see blackish water coming out of the filter until you realize that it is simply from the unused carbon.

This is reasonably priced, shipped quickly, and is a much better alternative then filling your freshwater supply with many more gallons of coolant.Bottom line. It works well, doesn't leak, and saves time and money."}

Definitely a must-have for any rv'er especially one that lives in the north."}

The roof-top of an RV is subjected to unrelenting sun and we've had several vent covers crumble and blow away  in a strong wind storms leaving the trailer interior below subject to moisture.Polycarbonate is another of many plastic compounds, and also subject to UV damage but the thickness of these covers indicates that they will likely last far longer than past covers.Diminished light transmission - The thickness of these covers does limit the opacity/light transmission of these covers relative to thinner white covers so be prepared for that.Fit in a standard RV/Trailer rooftop vent was good."}

Many of those kits were labeled by AAA.  So, strangely when I went looking for a first aid kit with something more than band-aids and rubber gloves (who really needs those, anyway?), I found this, complete with gauze and tape and stuff you need in the real-world if you get stuck, stranded, or hurt.  I wanted to go a little bigger with other things like peroxide and cold compress, but it was cheaper to buy those separately and just go with this kit."}

Removes a lot of extra tubing that doesn't need to be their. When installing, put the metal clamp things on first, then the rubber tube. Fit the rubber tube over the fittings (Air box or the Intake itself) then put the metal clamps over the rubber tubes that connect the Intake tube to the rest of the motor/air box. This is the easiest way to install it since the holes that this tube has to go over distort it enough to make installing with the metal clamps on impossible. After I figured this out, it only took me ten minutes after fighting with it for fifteen. Good luck and happy Hunting! :)"}

{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this at the same time as a load equalizing hitch.  I wasn't sure I needed it as the trailer seemed to tow fine, but I thought it might be useful in high wind.  After towing with the sway control installed, I plan to use it whenever I am towing.  It seems to cancel out a lot of the small movements created by the trailer and makes the tow vehicle ride better and feel more stable.  The only disadvantage I have found is that the sway control \"groans\" going around corners.  This is one of those \"that is just the way it works\" situations, but it would be nice if it were quieter.  It also adds another step to hitching up the trailer, but the sway control is very easy to install and remove.  Overall, a worthwhile addition even for a trailer that tows well already."}

What I did was put it under the large bracket that hold the hitch and that did work pretty good.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it doesn't have a protrusion to bleed air if you over inflate the tires. No big deal, I just use a pointed tool such as a philips screw driver to bleed air."}

The tire valve/gauge seal is great, the rubberized handle easy to grip (even with gloves) and the size fits nicely in a glove compartment.  After three years of nearly monthly readings on all my family's cars, I'm yet to replace the batteries.  This is the third digital gauge I've owned; the first one was worthless trash and the second was ok but not particularly well made or durable.

The only slight inconvenience is that the reading doesn't lock on so that could pull it off of the stem to see, you must read while it's still on.  And then due to the shape you have to be a little on the one side to read it.  Really minor inconveniences, it's still very easy to use and seems to be very accurate and consistent.

A few times I have completely missed seeing them on my dashboard and pulled the car too far. Luckily I use a brick as a safety stop under the tire or else I would have nicked the wall. Short product life."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Very good product.  Now my wife can pull into the garage without backing up and maneuvering her car to get it right.  Easy to install.  As a point of reference for her, I put a small &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash.  When we pull the car in all she needs to do is get the light to be within an inch of the &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash 360 degrees and the car is parked perfect.  Our garage is a 3 car one, but with my car, motor cycle, large mower, tools, tool chest, garbage cans, lawn equipment, wall cabinets,  etc....we need to make sure we manage the space.  And now we have more space."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Used it to hook-up our curt sway bar to our 25' trailer and this attachment made it easy!! We bought a Ball that detaches with a 2&#34; lift to attach it to. It lifted the trailer and we were able to attach the sway bar for less then 100 dollars (thats for the sway bar kit, the reese adaper peice and the new ball with lift) way less expensive then all those lifting kits that are 4-500 hundred dollars just starting out, granted many not be as good as a lift/equalizer kit but for someone on a tight budget it works!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have one of theses I got at a local store.  Used it on my Trailmanor Travel Trailer.  It fit nice and sung.  I later found out that the key is universal and fits all the same coupler locks.  Not to safe there.  Got a new TT and it has a 4 1/4in lip.  This would not fit on it.  It measures about 4in from lock end to lock end so your hitch must be 4in or smaller.  Overall, it's a nice cheap lock but won't stop someone who really wants to get it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I'm a professional detailer.This sealant is one of the best out there, if you're paint is prepped properly. I use my 3\" Griot's garage buffer to apply this stuff on the lowest buffer speed with a 3M Perfect-It waffle pad. Meguiar's has been in the detailing business for a long time and I use all of their Mirror Glaze/Professional products. Some other brands are more expensive for less amount of product and produce the same results. This price is great for the amount you get, buy this and you'll be happy. See the images I uploaded."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I tried Chevron Techron as people recommended here: meaning filled up it twice and also filled out my engine with Tufoil Engine Treatment and my mpg didn't improve at all.I drive 09 Accord EX-L V6 and constantly getting around 20mpg on 91/93 octane fuel driving from Brooklyn to Long Island on Belt  & Cross Island Parkways. Mileage is horrible because there is never a steady speed and often traffics, but even when there is no traffic - still horrible 20mpg. I do write this review after 3 full tanks that were filled after 2 Chevron Techrons."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I do high mileage intervals using 100% synthetic oil in my car.  I always use this on the last tankful of gas before an oil change.  It's amazing how much gunk winds up in the oil after running this stuff through the system.  It definitely loosens carbon deposits as the oil turns pitch black after a tankful of this gas and a 20 oz bottle of Techron.  The oil after a full change remains pretty clear for quite a while so I'm pretty confident pairing this with an oil change is beneficial. The mechanic at the dealer commented on how clean my engine was when they did a TSB job on it compared to another car from the same year with similar mileage."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Honestly, this is expensive and not everyone will need it!  &#34;IF&#34; - If you have a problem with cylinder and spark plug build up due to poor gas quality and possibly a bit of oil ash build up, this product does help.  But to use it as directed.... and you should..... also more is NOT better..... then it gets expensive to add it to your gas all the time.  If the problem is persistent, and you end up adding to your gas as directed all the time, it will work very well, but, it adds at least 25 cents per gallon to the cost of your fuel!Summary:  Good product,  works well, but costs too much to use all the time: very over priced,"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a great product. I use it once per year to clean my fuel system on a 1990 Camry. Still have the original fuel injectors. Do NOT use too much. Follow the directions on the bottle. If you use too much, it will deteriorate plastic and rubber parts in the fuel line. It will also make your car run rough. When I first used this years ago, i made that mistake and called Chevron. The technician at Chevron stated emphatically that you should NOT use more than is recommended on the bottle. In this case,. more is NOT better. When used as directed, it will keep your fuel system clean and your car running great. You can reach Chevron Technical support at 1.800.582.3835"}

There is nothing that comes close to the durability of Optimum.  It actually outlasts regular paste waxes.Pros:-Awesome durability for a spray wax-Real wax looks, great depth and warm glow-Super easy to use-Smells great-A little goes a LONG way, use sparinglyCons:-streaks when used on a hot car, though this really isn't a con, its more of a DUH.-streaks if you use too much, again, is that really a con?This is a huge value, while it appears it is more expensive than a regular spray wax, it goes twice as far easily, and I bet most people are used to using way more, and thus get streaking.  I'd estimate I get twenty, yes 2-0 cars per bottle.  Great stuff, my favorite spray wax for dark colors."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I love these in both sizes.  The small one fits saucers or bowls.  The larger one fits 9 inch paper plates.  So I got the for the travel trailer, liked them so much got 3 more for the house.  Installed under my kitchen cabinets.  Spray painted them, with Rustoleum for plastic.  They blend right in.  So convenient,kids of 8ish age can reach them, saves on washing dishes, and Amazon has some great buys on paper products when buy in bulk!  What more could you ask?I saw some comments on how easily they move and plates might fall...so I took a piece of tape, taped a small bit to itself for a handle, and taped it so it can't move til I want it to. Not because it did move, because others said it does.  Might not need that tape..."}

The correct size and part # was on the receipt/invoice when they arrived (19 days later), but they sent covers for a 13\" wheel (I needed 28\"). When I contacted Amazon, they said my size was no longer available so they sent these. Are you kidding me??? 13\" covers for 28\" wheels!! Who made this decision...a monkey?So I sent it back for a refund. I couldn't tell if the covers were good quality, cause I never opened the box. What a major let down after waiting almost 3 weeks. I went to a local camper store and got a set there the next day. Sometimes, saving a few bucks just ain't worth it!!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have ordered two of these chargers for maintaining my batteries on my ATV and Riding Mower in the winter months last year and they have done great. I have three more on order right now for more coverage on new Tractor, another ATV and anotherriding mower as well. I also have two maintaining chargers mounted on my boat that are Schumacher brands that have never failed me in the last three years of storing my boat.I also have one Schumacher  Quick Charger for jumping and starting dead batteries. I have never been disappointed with any of the Schumacher chargers at all. My late Father used to use only this brand, and that is why I continue using the Schumacher brand!How can you go wrong with Quality products!!All of my chargers have been ordered from Amazon.com where most of everything I oder comes from. Great service and products all around."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a great little unit... I actually own 4 of them.  I use them to maintain the batteries on my two motorcycles, the lawn tractor and my Porsche over the winter.  They are connect and forget, which is great.  Since they employ \"float charging\" there's no danger of overcharging a battery which can happen if you leave a regular battery charger connected too long.  I wouldn't recommend one of these to bring a fully discharged battery back to life since the charging output is so low, I'd use a regular battery charger instead.  But these units are great for their designed purpose and that is to \"maintain\" a battery during periods of inactivity.  I've had no problems with any of my 4 units.  By-the-way, you can also use the Deltran cables with this Schumacher unit.  Deltran also makes battery tenders and their extension and various connection cables are easier to find."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use it for my Motor scooter, it has a very small 12 volt battery. The small rings in the box fit perfectly (I left them mounted to the battery in the scoot). The quick disconnect is a really nice feature. I ran the battery down once (left the black cable off after maintenance and forgot to connect the schumacher, my bad...). The small scooter batteries are notorious for not holding a charge. When I reattached the cable, I reattached the unit and it recharged it in a few hours. It then kept it charged till the spring. I'm very happy with this unit."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this to charge the battery on my 99 Lexus GS400.  The battery has gone dead a couple times and I was ready to buy a replacement but thought I would get this and try it.  Its a battery re-born!  Works like new now... this lil baby does a great job of slow charging and also tells you the battery percentage.  Its made well, very compact and is asthetically pleasing to the eye.  I also love that it has storage in the back to put the cables/clips for storage.If you need a battery charger...this is THE one to get!Buy with confidence!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Very light and easy to store. Fan noise is very noticable but it stays in the garage so who cares.  I love the LED readout for % charged and volts when plugged in and attached to battery.  Very pleased the the charger but for those of you who like the feel of a heavy metal constructed unit that can take a beating this is not your cup of tea.  All plastic and the buttons seem equally flimsey but so far they work well. Time and use will tell how long they will hold up."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "While there are many new blade style wiper blades on the market, the  pressure distribution of original style steel frame blade can't be beat for a clean wipe.  The Anco Winter blade is a steel frame blade with a rubber cover over the frame to keep ice from rendering it useless.  They have been making this blade for more than 40 years and they are still the best in the winter.  The new blade style is okay but pressure distribution is not as good.  The ends tend to raise off the glass when the windshield curve get tighter like at the edges. Plus these cost less.  Who wants to spend $18 dollars for a blade you have to replace in a year?"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The product I just received from Amazon today is the more basic/generic ANCO wiper blade (31-series; same as available locally at walmart for less $). Don't buy this product expecting an AeroVantage blade, which is a premium model; you likely won't get it. I should have verified the ANCO part number before purchase. The cheap wiper blade is model 31-28, whereas an AeroVantage blade is 91-28. The listing title needs to be fixed.That said, I've used these cheaper ones in the past, and they're decent. Haven't had problems with them, and they've been at least as good as any other cheap wiper blade.Another odd note: I ordered several of these, and each came in its own shipping box. I don't know why they couldn't have been packed together, but they weren't."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "the 31 series and anco in general always work great for me. No squeaks, streaks, easy install and last a long time..I tried other brands and was let down.UPDATE- 11/13 this blade no longer works for an 05 acura TSX. its the correct length at 26 inches but it does not work. I have an 05 TSX and tried this blade today and the way the tip of blade is, it hits the wiper arm in a way that does not allow the wiper to lay fully flat on the windshield and top tip of blade is about an inch off the windshield.. I used this brand before but they changed the design at some point. It will not work, trust me. I ended up using a brand called rain eater and it works perfectly."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Like all Bosch automotive products, this wiper blade is well designed and does its job extraordinarily well. It uses the standard hook attachment method for wiper arms, and fits snugly (installed on my '00 Accord). When researching wiper blades, I found that the newer \"mono\" style of wiper blade do not quite compare to this standard design, as the newer, more bulkier Rain-X style tend to catch the wind and thus skip spaces on the windshield. I found mine on sale at a local Autozone for $13."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is very good wax to quickly wax and shine your car. Application is easy with the included applicator, done by hand, allow it to dry to a pale haze, then wipe it off using a quality towel, finish it up using a microfiber cloth to get that super wet shine. I used on top of a car that I had sealed with Jetseal 109 from Chemical Guys which had already provided the car a great look, this wax on top provides that ultra lustrous show room new look. Great product. Picked up in the local Wal store for about the same price though.."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Sometimes I wish my car was BIGGER, just so I could wax even MORE of it with Meguiar's A-2216 Deep Crystal Carnuba Wax.This is a labor of love, (but not a frustrating exercise in removing powdered wax from trim and other areas, like it can be when you use other brands of car waxes). I find that using a spray bottle of water and lightly spritzing that portion of the car that I am Meguiar-waxing makes the shine even more intense.I usually wax the car twice, to get a very deep shine -- the first day I let the new wax coat settle, then the second day, hose down the car, dry it and Meugiar-Wax it again, for a beautiful deep finish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been using Mequiar's Quik Detailer for years and it is still the best product I've found.  I've tried other brands including new ones to the market place, and this is still the leader.  One thing I really like about it is if I miss a spot, a quick spray and the surface is consistent in shine and appearance.  Some of the other sprays would be totally dependent on how much product you used, so I would have to go back and keep blending until the difference wasn't noticeable."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just bought this product after washing my new car for the first time.  I didn't take the time to dry it because I normally don't have issues with water spots but at my apartment my water is awful I guess.  Needless to say my car was destroyed with them.  Huge white nasty spots everywhere.  So I did some research and found this got good reviews so I gave it a shot and WOW.  It totally works on bad waterspots and brought them right out of the finish.  I was very impressed."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just used this on my car and it does live up to the reviews listed below.  I think the labeling \"natural shine\" does in fact fit this product well.  It gave my car interior a nice \"showroom\" shine but not overly so.  It left the interior glossy and new looking but I would not describe it as greasy or shiny in a distracting way.  Very good product.  I recommend spraying directly onto a towel first so not to get it everywhere in your vehicle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is one of my favorite Meguiar's products. I use it on the dashboards and external plastic and vinyl trim. Just give the bottle a good shake, spray on a little and wipe the surface to a brilliant, clean shine. Even after washing the car, when I use the Meruiar's Natural Shine the cleaning power of the product is evident by looking at the blackened cloth used to apply it.Here's a product that works so well, that it's a pleasure to use. I highly recommend Meguiar's Natural Shine Vinyl & Rubber Protectant."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This was extremely easy to use.  I would do one side of the car and do the next while waiting for it to dry.  Then buff with a microfiber towel and you're good to go.  Came with an applicator, but I used my own pads.  I will keep that one with the tin if I'm ever in a pinch.  It left a great shine on the car that even still exists 2 weeks later after a trip across 2 states during some rain storms.  The only blemishes are the bugs I hit along the way.  Also, I have to park my car outside in the elements.  excellent wax!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've used this weeks upon weeks for cleaning my car, as well as my family members' cars.This soap produces nice soapy bubbles, and you don't need all that much for a full bucket of water. It's a good price as well, for the amount of soap you use per bucket (2-4 quarter sized drops).You're welcome to ask any detailer (I personally have) and they say that they even sometimes use this when their professional soap isn't available!It's not magic by any means, but it won't strip your paint of protectant or wax like dish soap (Dawn, etc) can.I'd highly recommend this to others, and would buy it again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This car wash cleaned the car very well,but it left water spots. To be fair the car was in the sun and I was talking to someone while I was drying.It was about 75 degrees outside that day and sunny. I washed silver,blue,red and grey colored cars with no problem.I live in NYC and the water is not that hard.A little goes a long way and its very foamy.Works well in the foam gun.Just dry it quickly if your car is black.Otherwise 5 stars!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I normally use Optimum car wash, but thought I'd try this as it is half the price. I found it cleaned well but you had to rinse well and towel off as it will leave spots if allowed to dry on its own. I now use this soap if the car is not real dirty, but like the Optimum car wash as I find it lubricates better. It does provide tons of suds and they do last till the job is done.All in all, not bad for an over the counter soap and I would buy again if I got caught short."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been trying lots of brake dust cleaners and this one is about the best one I've used so far. I like it because it's not expensive and available at most discount stores.  I have found that I have to use my wheel brush to completely remove the brake dust and as I agitate the solution, it seems to become jelly like.  When this happens, I've learned to rinse off immediately.  If the wheel doesn't become complete clean, I have to repeat the process.  I always wash my wheels first before I start washing the car's body.  I have used lots of Meguiar's products and have been very satisfied."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I love Meguiar products - especially the quick detailer and tech wax.This product seemed to work really well on newer tires and maintained a nice glossy, black wet look for over a week of local driving.This one let me down a bit on older tires on another car though -- it goes on looking great, but after drying leaves the tires only looking a bit darker black and without any gloss.  Perhaps these older tires are more porous from wear and age, or a different composition that the product didn't respond well to."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I really like this product. Although I prefer the 3M tire restorer, it happens to be extremely expensive, so I just use this Meguiar's. It gives a really good shine and I also used it on plastics -they become really black, trust me.Note: Some people give this 3 or 4 stars because \"it stains\" or \"doesn't last long\" this is ludicrous. On my car it does hold up at least 3 weeks to a month easy. You can expect it to last for a year. Same thing with staining the pavement -most of this product do, is normal. For the price this is the best product out there"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "i bought it thinking it was shinier than the cheaper ones that come in a spray canister. i was wrong they are pretty much the same. and little annoying things like not properly labeling the nozzle to let you know if your spraying wide or narrow is a pain. you have to spray to know whether the on setting is narrow or wide. this is my first week using it and i gotta tell yah this thing doesn't look like its going to last, even gingerly spraying this on my tire is wasting the spray at an alarming rate. i don't know if its just my bottle that came a little cracked but whenever i spray somehow someway the liquid leaks through the openings and gets all over my hands.other than that, the seller is fast and the package came in good condition."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had purchased two of these drying towels as I had read that these may not work as well as advertised. WAS I WRONG! The towel easily soaked up all the water that was coming off the car, leaving it spotless. I had a friend help me with the second towel and I was able to dry my car in record time and not have any water marks left on the paint. I just slid the towel over any parts with water and it left no trace of water and a clean shine to my car."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "While I don't necessary condone drying cars with a towel (micro-marring, even with microfiber), this is an awesome one that should (for the most part) keep your car safe from any debris that might be left on there as you dry. Remember to blot not swipe! Wring out the towel often and visually and physically inspect for dirt and debris. I usually wash after a use and keep it in a sealed (clean) 5 gallon bucket so no dirt/debris gets in. You will inevitably have to wring this out a couple times while drying a car, but that can't be a negative? You want a towel twice the size go for it - but you'll be touching that to the ground or wheel or something else accidentally drawing up some dirt with it. The size and functionality of this is perfect, I highly recommend this product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just detailed my Corvette and tossed the old cloths I had and purchased some new ones. I opted for the Mequiars and they were excellent. As with most of these type cloth they quickly absorbed whatever it is you are trying too remove whether it is detailing liquid or wax or the grime from a clay bar. I have to use several clean ones on each vehicle I clean however I have been able to wash them and get them back to their almost original condition. The biggest drawback i have is the cost for each cloth. I am shopping for a lower cost substitute. They are still worthy of a four str rating and the one star is deducted due to the high cost."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have tried several microfiber towels recently, they are all great in comparison to using a standard terry cloth, that being said not all microfiber towels are created equally.  First and foremost always be certain to pull the tags off any towel you use before working on that show car in your garage.  These towels I give a good 4 star rating but not five to due to the fact that while being microfiber they still left some minute residue behind on my cars finish.  They are better than Zwipes, they are much much bigger than Zwipes, but sadly pale in comparison to Cobra microfiber towels.  I feel the cost versus value regarding this item isn't very good, you only get 3 towels for nearly $9.00 so for me this is a once and once only purchase."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product is so inferior to Griots that it is not funny. Look, Meguiar's makes great car wax products, this is probably a product they sub out and then add a make up too. It's too thin, to small, just all together beneath the reputation of Meguiar's product line. As a drying cloth not very good at all. As a wax removal cloth just not good enough. Listen if you detail your engine compartment these are just fine. If you are not a car person, these are going to be good enough for you, really. But if you are fussy about your car, wax it , detail it.... these would be the product you want to use for wheels, engines and door jams. I already own them so that is what I will use them for, same a an old house towel would be used. If that is what you are looking for , look no further, these will do. But for drying or wax removal....NOT."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The Meguiar's X2020 are the best bang for the buck, bar none!  What separates them from MOST other microfiber towels is that they are LARGE in size.  Most other microfiber towels, including the popular Zwipes here on Amazon are much smaller so you need 2-3 of them to do what 1 of these X2020's do.  The X2020's are also high quality and remove wax or detailing polish/liquid so smoothly.  The roughly $2 or so price per towel is pricey but b/c of what they do, it's definitely worth it.  Next time Amazon has a sale, i'm loading up on these again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased these microfiber cloths because of all the good reviews, and I needed a couple cloths - very handy to have around. The quality of the cloths are ok, and does a decent job at cleaning.  I am not sure how long these cloths will last after multiple washes as the quality is average.  So far they work just fine, but just think they are some less expensive options for the quality.  I wish someone made some high-end cloths that could work inside my car and on my iPhone."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "These are thick and well-made, and provide smooth application of wax on your car.  On the down side--because they are so thick, they absorb a lot of wax that just ends up being washed out of the pad after use.  Also, I did soak the pad overnight because it was a little dirty after using it all over my car.  It still hasn't cleaned out all of the dirt and excess wax.  I'll see how it looks after washing it in my washing machine."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My 2010 Fusion has 72,000 miles now and I noticed a small loss of power and the engine would idle a little roughly. More vibration then usual. I've changed the air filter, spark plugs, no difference. I've used Zmax and other additives, and not much change. I put in the Marvel stuff, and notice a huge pickup in power, very smooth idle and gas mileage went up 2 mpg. I'd recommend this to anyone, with a newer or older vehicle. You can even add a small amount, (16 ounces), to your transmission fluid, and it'll clean any gunk inside. Will not harm it."}

That's about a quart)4 - 6 oz per 12 gallon fuel tankAt first use, keep engine idle for 30 mins for complete mixup and soak in.Then you drive for 1 hour, then you can switch engine off."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used these for a Lexus LS430 which uses a 16 and 24 inch blade. these fit well and I didnt realize they were same exact blades I bought previously. the last set lasted more than a year and the only negative is in the Hot Florida sun the rubber blades seemed to dry out and get slightly hard and on the way to getting brittle. These dont make any squeaks and clean water away from glass well even under torential Florida rain. I tried another set and they didnt fit this car, dont get the ones without the thin metal frame like these for this vehicle as the mounting area is too wide to fit wiper arms."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "No place to store CD's - unless you unzip the portion you see with a map sticking out of it and put the cases in there.  I was replacing one with individual felt slots to store DVD's without the cases.  Can't do that here.The zippers open very easily though, and the mesh works great for a garage door opener.  I use the sunglasses spot for my gas card and gift cards.I like the adjustable straps since I have slightly larger than normal visors on my 2012 Nissan Juke and the one I was replacing was elastic straps that barely fit over it.  I kept waiting for them to snap and fall off.So as long as you only have a few things to get out of the way, this works alright."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "got a similar item on amazon for about the same price - wasn't sure which would be better, and for the price it was worth getting 2 different ones to find out.seems to be very good quality - made in USA, heavy plastic, very dense wires for the post cleaning side, brass brush (not steel as pictured). as others mentioned, you have to be careful only turn the post tool clockwise since the wires are angled.the other item is much lighter plastic, steel brush (if little bits break off, and they will, they'll rust and so will where ever they got stuck into), not so dense wires on the post cleaning side. was not advertised as made in USA, but it's funny - its packaging says made in USA on the front, and then made in China on the back.both items will do the job, but this Lisle is definitely the much better quality at the same price."}

I was almost to the point that I was just going to have some quick lube place change the oil filter for me every other time the oil needed to be changed.Then... I stumbled upon this awesome little socket designed specifcally for my GM 2.2L engine. I needed an 8 or 12-inch extension bar to properly reach the oil filter cover (and it hadn't been removed in a while so it needed some \"elbow grease\", too).But, now I can change my Saturn's oil filter with ease and style!Thank you!!!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Ordered many brushes. Some of my brush will remain dry to dust off the brake parts, another brush to dust off electric fan grills and A/C window units near the filter. Another to quick clean my chain saw of sawdust before I open the oil tank cover and inside the safety guard filled with sawdust. Have one in the kitchen to wash with water the many parts of the machine we use for cooking. That will stay in the kitchen to avoid contamination. And cost effective enough to have some for spare since it takes a few days to receive it from the mail."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The brush is made of a VERY hard plastic. It is intended to clean very hard areas, do not even think about cleaning something sensitive, this is for heavy use only.The Handle is a very cheap - but hard - plastic. One can easily notice the part where they got together, although I thought and wanted it to be wood, that'd be perfect.Bought to clean the studs on the wheel but not sure it it'll scratch them, probably not since it's just plastic. Looks like it will last forever!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "With the fine threading it may be stronger but doubt that this feature will make a difference. The split washer is chrome plated which is a mistake as the chroming weakens the washer and a piece off the end cracked off when I first attached the ball to a hitch.The directions state that the nut should be torqued to 450 ft. lbs. which is likely to be an error. Hard to even find a torque wrench that goes up to 450 foot lbs. much less someone who could tighten the nut to that specification without a 4 foot cheater bar."}

Second I tried an older version of this product but am rating this The two others made by Meguiars, gold class car wash shampoo and conditioner as well as ultimate wash and wax do noticbly better than this but are also more expensive, however turtle wax wash and wax does it just as good with little or not water spots. Others cost more but will be worth it, I mean how often do you wash your car? for most people not very often, at the most 3-4 times a year, so you might as well use a nice product, not a cheap one like htis"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is a solid, versatile lock that will fit Class II, Class III and Class IV hitch receivers.  Mine came with two hardened-steel chrome plated pins (not a sleeve as was illustrated when I bought it).  The smaller pin works with Class II and Class III hitch receivers.  The larger pin works with Class IV.  I use this lock to secure my bike rack and it's tough enough that I wouldn't want to lose my keys.  The keyhole is protected by a weather-resistant rubber cover, yet rotates for easy accessibility.  This is a rugged, versatile hitch lock offered at a good price."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The California Car Duster is the best quick duster I have ever come across. This thing lasts years. Dare I say, its dusting abilities have gotten even better over time. Mine is like 5 years old and I have used it on numerous vehicles, and it works great for removing dry dust and powdery films on cars without leaving any streaking behind. It takes less than a minute to do the entire car (even the windows) and it really does make a big difference, especially if your car gets covered in pollen. This duster will most likely become a vital part of your car care routine because it can be used regardless of what you do to wash/polish/wax; you just use this for a quick clean up.  I actually bought the combo exterior duster and interior duster.HINTS: Only use this when dry, getting this wet will streak the wipes. Also keep the brush in the supplied case because the brush itself will get dusty if left exposed."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It gets so dusty out here in Massachusetts and my 2012 BLACK Jeep Grand Cherokee picks up sooo much dust!I hate spending hours washing and waxing my beautiful SUV only to come out the next day and find a thin layer of dust on my SUV. I got the California Car Duster as an easy fix to rid the dust and it dusts sooo beautifully! The first time use left a bunch of red dust threads on my Jeep, but after a few uses, it went away.I have it sitting in the cargo area of my Jeep because black is so hard to keep clean!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this kit to diagnose the hard start problem on my 96 XJ Cherokee. Took about ten minutes to figure out I had low pressure on the rail due to bleed-back. Bad check valve or pressure regulator, both of which are part of my fuel pump assembly. New assembly, problem solved! This kit worked perfect out of the box. Teflon tape on gauge fittings, pressure relief hose nice and long, very easy to use. Adapters to fit almost any car, i.e. you can rent it to your friends for five bux! Nice pouch for storage too! Has complete instructions, though they're hardly necessary."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This fuel pressure tester worked great for me.  I was able to connect it to the test port on my fuel rail and test pressure within literally about 2 min. I didn't have any help, so i was able to lay the gauge down on the windshield and watch the results as I ran several tests from the drivers seat.  Since the gauge has a rubber bumper around it, it stayed in place even when the fuel line pressurized.  I did not have any problems with leaks at the fuel pressure release button.  This tester confirmed I need a new fuel pump. I think it is the perfect balance of price, quality and functionality for the DIY'er."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "You get just what you think you'll get with these cheap mats from Rubber Queen.  They are thin and look similar to OEM mats, albeit without a custom shape or buttons to snap into place.  The thinness may mean that they will wear out relatively quickly, but it also makes them unobtrusive.  Thick mats can take some time to adapt to, since my feet are in a different position relative to the gas and brake pedals.In terms of color, the black fits with my generic black flooring well enough to be practically invisible, which is great.  Overall, a good value and I won't feel too bad about throwing them away if they become too messy to clean."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This was a good fit for my 2004 Toyota Sienna XLE.  One thing to note is that the filter is not marked as to the orientation it should go inside the air cleaner assembly.  The side of the rubber gasket that has the groove on it goes down and the long edge with the notches in the groove go towards the front of the vehicle.  You can't get the cover back on with it incorrectly assembled but it would be nice for them to print on it the orientation.  Good quality though.  Visit my blog at johnfixesstuff.blogspot.com and search for air filter to get instructions with detailed pictures on how to install this filter on your Sienna."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Strong and well made. I recommend this product, and Prime for shipping 2-day. Very handy to have one of these, good truck fit and connection, nice there are two positions for mounting it. Though it states Made in China it seems well made. Expect the paint to come off with use, lube the hook well. The only problem I foresee is grease on the pants if you choose to leave it on, as you can't put a cover over it. Leaving it on the farthest-in position may help."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "At first I thought this was a gimmick product, but when mounted on the side and the back of our RV it gives me a simple way of knowing if my RV is relatively level.  They are small and unobtrusive (that's nice), but fairly accurate.  Both levels come with a sticky pad that's about half the size of the unit, so no screws are needed.  I'm not sure how well the sticky pads will hold up over time in the weather, but I'll update this review if needed.  I wish the sticky pads were larger, but I could always get larger pads if it becomes an issue in the future.  It's best to mount these little buggers when your RV is already level.  It's probably best to mount one directly over the wheel(s) of your trailer, but not necessary.  Overall, I am very happy with these little levels."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I got my rv level and checked it using bubble levelers in several locations. Once it was for sure completely level I put these on the front by my electric tounge jack where I can see them when I am leveling the trailer. one is positioned for the side to side level and one is positioned for the up and down front and back level.They work great. I cleaned the area really good with alcohol and used the adhesive backers they came with.You can drill holes and screw them on but I do not like drilling holes if I do not have to.They have been on there for some time now and if they start coming off I will just get some 3m command strips or just get new ones since they are not that expensive."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff has a million uses in the garage and around the house/yard.  Any fastener that may rust, corrode, or otherwise lock up, just put a thin coat on the threads and don't worry...it'll come right off next time.  Use it on axle bolts, lug nuts, spark plugs, really any nut, bolt, screw, or anything exposed to the elements that you don't wan to seize.  And for the price, an 8oz bottle will last you for years!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use Permatex regularly, especially on lug bolts. It is economical and this size container is especially handy to have. Remember to stir the contents well and use only a very small amount. I tend to use a disposable acid brush for application, rather than the lid mounted brush. In fact, I tend to remove the included brush and prefer to just have the lid as a lid.  It has never failed me. I would use a copper based product for exhaust work, but this works well for all other fasteners. It also cleans up easy."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought the Scan Gauge II for one purpose and that was for the transmission temperature gauge for my Silverado. The other option was to replace the dash cluster with one that had the transmission temperature gauge and the Scan Gauge was cheaper by a long shot. Besides having the gauge I was wanting now I've got several others to like the actual water temperature plus the ability to identify and clear engine codes. I've had it on my truck long enough now to say that this is a good product. It works like it's supposed to and unlike a lot of the blue tooth units that transmit the info to the smart phone the Scan Gauge doesn't have to be reprogrammed every time it's turned on from the last time you used it. The Scan Gauge comes back on with the same display every time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces. Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works. I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go. This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more. The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product. You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle. Don't wait like I did. Order this NOW!!! As usual Amazon came through with the shipping. If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me. Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I found Permatex at Advance Auto and have been very pleased with it's performance.I used to use Devcon bulb grease for many years until I finished the tubeand could no longer find it locally.Besides the many great used for automobiles, this grease resolves problems with light bulbsin the house being hard to turn and or breaking off in sockets, and is perfect for oven light bulbs.It only takes a tiny bit each time, about 1/16\" bead of grease spread on the bulb threads.A tube (.33 oz) lasts a long time. If used for household only, probably several years!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I put this on almost everything that has an electrical connection. WAY&#8230; Way&#8230; Cheaper purchasing this tune then buying little packets every time a bulb needs to be replaced, or spark plugs.When I change plugs I put this on, fixed a poor radio connection putting this in the plug (Never flickers, or turns off now), putting some on bulbs insures an easy removal in the future. If you have had a stuck bulb you know what I'm talking about.Great stuff every one should have some laying around!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The grease is perfect. The thing that bothers me is that I used this one time (very gently I may add) and the tube that it's in got a bunch of little pin holes in it and now the grease leaks out in my tool box. To make matters worse, I opened the tool box the other day and the cap had split in two so now there's even more leaking out! I thought I could buy this and keep it around for future use, but now I am going to have to throw it away after using just a tiny bit on my spark plug wires. What a bummer."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Use this goop on trailer line connections and when you replace a bulb in any application where moisture is likely.  My Tracker boat trailer has incandescent bulbs and they are encapsulated in nearly water-tight containers, but they do get water within.  They are not meant to be 100% tight so if you replace a bulb, be sure to add some of this stuff to the socket.  Also, the true thief of light is corrosion, not bulb extinction, so apply some wherever there is a vulnerable spot.When changing spark plugs, along with the application of anti seize on the plug threads, use some dielectric grease at the junction of the coil pack and valve cover gasket and at the wire to coil pack."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "For some reason, I bought a 1998 M109A4.  Like a lot of these purchases, it seemed to make good sense at the time.  These 6x6s have typically been outside for a long time, and while they dont have a lot of highway miles, they sure do have UV damage and rust.  I have 9 windows and 4 doors with gaskets that are really expensive to replace.  Smear this grease on and the gaskets are generally good as new.  I use it on all hoses and gasketed electrical connections."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just got a 99 XJ cherokee and the lift-gate struts worked fine in warm weather where I bought it, but when I got it home to the mountains they stopped working in the cold. I am spoiled by the nice struts on my 96 XJ, so I bought a set of the Strongarm struts here on Amazon due to many positive reviews here and in Cherokeeforum.com. I put these on the Jeep in about 20 minutes and all it took was a small flat-head screwdriver and a 10mm socket. It was way easier than I expected! I used an adjustable backcountry ski pole to hold the hatch up while I did the work and it worked just fine. The hatch now goes up and stays up all by itself and works perfectly so I'm extremely satisfied with the fit and function as well as the sweet deal for a pair of new ones here on amazon."}

You just mix it with water, wash the car as usual, and the darn thing is shining like there is no tomorrow! I am a little concerned about it building up on the windows, but so far, so good, and it's been raining like crazy and no spots or wiper chatter. A miracle!

{"label": 2, "raw": "I have been washing all my cars for years with Turtle Wax Car Wash and have always been satisfied with this Turtle Wax products.When I bought this product, Turtle Wax ZIP CarWax, I was really disappointed about its wash performance :- the &#34;concentrate&#34; in the bottle is very watery to begin with; no comparison to Turtle Wax's original ZIP car wash- even though I used 1 fl. oz. (~ 30 ml) with a bucket of water this product does not generate any suds- because of this it is tough to get grime and dirt off; you have to scrub really hardI am baffled that this product has so many positive reviews; maybe Turtle wax recently has changed the formula for this product, and I got the newest version."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Once a year seems pretty accurate. I'm sure it varies on where you live, how dirty your car gets, how often you wash it, how you wash it, what detergent you use, etc., etc. But it was highly rated by Consumer Reports so I figured I'd give it a shot. Goes on, wipes off easy - or about the same as other paste waxes I've used. Oh, and yes, this is a polish not a cleaner. If your paint is really dirty, faded, etc, then you need to use a cleaner first then a polish. Put it on thin, in the shade, keep it off plastic, use a microfiber cloth - in other words follow the directions and use it correctly and it works great. And, yes, if you have chips in your paint they will turn white - just like with any other polish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Meguiar's Quik is cheap, which is great as long as your interior is already pretty clean. It has no intrinsic cleaning power of it's own beyond that of water. In other words, it will clean exactly as well as a damp cloth. Any dirt that can't be lifted with a damp cloth will stay put. It does have a nice scent, which dissipates in a matter of hours. You'll probably want a more effective product if your car gets a lot of use and/or carries many passengers."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I really like this product. It is not shiny and doesn't smell chemically like some products. (names unmentioned) It dries to a flat finish and doesn't leave any greasy feel to it like (unmentioned again).Does not appear to build up like \"other\" products, but, I've only been using it for about 6 months but will definitely buy and use more when needed. It is great for navigation/audio/video screens too!!! I don't use it on leather as I have cleaners/moisturizers for that, but, otherwise I use this on all but the headliner.My interior is black all over and any spec of dust shows up and is very noticeable. This stuff cleans all of the dust and anything that may have stained w/out issue. Again, no film and no buildup. The non-greasy finish is the most appealing part of this product and the smell is an added plus."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "A few sprays and a wipe down with a microfiber cloth and the interior of my car looks like I just detailed it. Of course, you have to detail the car first. It's not a miracle worker. But when you want to get back to the detail look without major effort, this is the way to go. I keep the bottle and some clothes in my trunk on club rides.Compared to heavier interior cleaners, like Armorall, this stuff doesn't get oily residue on your windows. It doesn't wipe off glass completely clean but over spray comes off with just a little window cleaner."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been using diluted (10 to 1) Simple Green to clean the interior of my cars for many years. It works on nearly any surface except glass.  It's also cheap and smells pleasant (at least to my unrefined sniffer).  I decided to buy this Meguiars interior detailed just to compare it with Simple Green.  I love Meguiars Gold class exterior spray detailed - the stuff is just amazing.  I also use Meguiars cleaner wax on my cars.There is absolutely nothing wrong with this product.  It does exactly what it says it should do.  I give it 4 stars for function and quality.  My gripe is that is doesn't really work any better than something 1/5 it's price.  I'll probably stick with Simple Green and skip buying this again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to \"hold\" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have owned these for about 8 years now.  They have held up very well.  No bend or flex ever noticed.  I use them for any under-car work that doesn't require the wheels being removed.  They are light, and easy to store by hanging them off a screw using the hole they already have built in.To the reviews that say they slide a lot: you need to have a gentle foot on the gas pedal.  If you try to drive up the ramps fast, you may push the ramp.  Take your time, be smooth with the gas, and you'll get up ok.Note if you own a low-riding sports car, the angle of these might not be low enough for you.  The easy solution to that problem is to take something like a 1\"x10\" board and butt it against the ramp.  Drive up on the wood first then continue onto the ramp.For the price, these are an A+ purchase!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I don't know what the complaint from some buyers is about these ramps not functioning well. I purchased four of these Rhino 8000 and drove my 2 wheel drive Jeep Cherokee up on them with no problem whatsoever. My garage floor is smooth concrete and I had no problem with slippage. The only thing that I'll say is you cannot be timid when driving up onto these or any other ramp because you could cause wheel spin which would lead to a problem. My XJ has been sitting on these four ramps for two weeks while I do several underside upgrades and they are holding very well."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This, my second kit, came from Amazon. I bought the first kit locally when I walked into my garage and saw a flat tire on the Honda CRV. I took the tire off the car, used a water bottle to find the air bubbles escaping the hole, followed the directions and repaired the flat. It took a little muscle to enlarge the hole and insert the plug. I cut off the excess plug and used a jump box  with an air compressor (that I periodically keep in the car)  to inflate the tire.Good thing the hole was in the tread. These kits won't work if the hole is in the sidewall.These kits pay for themselves with one use in time, money and frustration. Flats can cost $10 -15 to fix. I keep one in both cars.The jump box prevented tire damage because I didn't have to drive it to a gas station to be inflated."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have an '08 Polaris Sportsman 800, which by itself is not a slow machine. Once I added this filter as a replacement for the original, however, it was a whole different ballgame. I immediately notice the boost to acceleration and pickup from the motor, and as someone who rides mostly off-road in the desert I'm sure I'm adding longevity to the bike as well. Simple install; fits directly in place of the stock filter. A very inexpensive way to grab a few more horses."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had used this product before and was looking to purchase more. It is not available where I live so I had to order it online. This wax is a paste and is easy to apply with a slightly damp cloth or applicator. I am currently using it on my boat and cars. I would suggest working a smaller area to avoid the wax drying and becoming harder to remove. If you stay in a 2x2 or so section it is easy to put on and take off. It leaves a very slick surface and a good shine. If you use a carwash soap for cleaning, the wax will remain for quite some time. I have noticed it seems to hold up well on the boat in saltwater as well. That says a lot for anything in the Florida sun."}

It's a really nice starters kit for a good wax layer that you can wait around 48h to have a second one applied.Collinite is not a very famous brand such as Meguiar's or 3M (actually the same since 2012) but they make awesome products. Don't be fooled by the advertisement, if you do a research you'll find this is a GREAT quality and really good price. Probably the liquid version is easier for most people.The 476 is perfect for any color car same quality as the 915 (higher in carnauba, better for dark cars). Really good product!GO FOR IT"}

I received the item it's thick and slow to pour in the transmission small diameter fill tube.But overall it improved the shifting characteristics immediately.

They worked well with my 22 foot travel trailer, but now we have a 30 foot travel trailer, and they don't offer as much rear viewing sight. I will have to go to the factory extended mirrors. Which I kinda of expected that. For the money they do well!If you will do a lot of towing, and in busy areas, I would recommend the factory extended mirrors. They cost more, but may be worth the extra, as compared to side swiping someone! I think for as much as they do extend, they could of been a little larger, just my two cents worth."}

It's been about a month and they still look great, plus I had at least half a can of paint leftover in case I need to touch them up in the future.  Easy to use, I would definitely use again in the future.  I didn't attempt to use the supplied brush, I bought some higher quality brushes instead after reading reviews of the brush falling apart.  It was a rather cheap, low quality brush.  But the paint and caliper cleaner are both top notch.  No regrets!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this because I was tired of using those 'stick-style' pressure gauges, I never felt those gave an accurate reading since over time it seems that it became easier for those sticks to shoot out.In any case, this is a good gauge. It's got a good ergonomic feel which may or may not be important to you since you're generally not using it that long anyways. Clear digital display and a mini light. You can also program the gauge to set a target pressure for your front and rear tires which is a nice feature. The packaging claims that the battery is lifetime, I somehow doubt this, but it appears there is a screw on the backside that should give you access to the battery. I've never had to replace it yet anyways. Overall, a very good digital gauge for measuring your tire pressure."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I haven't used the set point part of it, but just the fact you can put it on the valve stem and audibly hear when it's done taking the reading makes it far superior to all my other ones. With other ones I'm bending down, trying to see if it's taken the reading or not. I mean, isn't kneeling down far enough? Do I really need to put my head towards the ground further? With other gauges, I do. Not with this one though. Big backlit display that automatically comes on and automatically goes back off. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed with this."}

Moody to say the least, as in sometimes it can be way off (readings of 10 psi above or below what it really is), but most of the time its spot on.I still keep one of the pen style manual ones in my glovebox just as a backup, but this has proven to be useful enough when I need it.The O-Ring issue that you see other reviews complaining about must have been fixed by now, because mine has no issue sealing against the tire stem.The memory feature is nice for easily recalling the correct pressures for your tires (it remembers two numbers, front and rear)."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After reading several reviews on this product I have to agree with most comments in regards to the locking fuel cap being poorly made. The Cap fits fine for the application. However the key mechanism is flimsy at best. The quality of the plastic components are not what I remember a Stant Locking Fuel cap to be. They def cheapened out on their manufacturing process`s.I gave the Stant Locking Fuel cap a 3 star rating only bc it does fit and is doing what the intended use is for. I do feel that if someone wants to remove the cap by force, they absolutely can. I primarily purchased this product based on Stant`s reputation in the Auto market, but this one leaves myself a bit disappointed. This is being used as a deterrent to help prevent vandals from pouring anything foreign into the tank. It does operate correctly when following the unlocking/locking procedures."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "As you may know, one cause of the \"check engine light\" coming on your dash is lack of pressure in the fuel system due to a faulty gas cap.Normally, when the \"check engine light\" comes on, I go out and tighten the gas cap; if that's the cause, the light will go off in an hour or so.However, if the light stays on, a cheap option is to replace the gas cap - a lot cheaper than taking it to the shop and getting charged an hour of labor and the shop cost of a gas cap. In my state, a car with the \"check engine\" light on during the inspection period will fail the inspection.If you replace the cap, and the light still stays on, then take it to the shop.This is a good price on the cap."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Amazon never fails to amaze me of the various range of products that they have. I got lucky and was able to buy this pack in Amazon warehouse deals for the price lower than Pepboys and Autozone. I really can't feel its effect on the gas mileage in our Corolla but I have sensed its increase in power. I also checked the engine oil at least once a week and you can definitely see the difference compared to the oil placed by another shop who did my previous oil change.The oil is a little bit expensive but it is definitely worth if for the machine that carries me and my family."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I highly recommend Mobil synthetic 5w-30 and 10w-30.  I have been using it in all of my cars, ATV, home generator, and 10w-30 in my trucks since 1990 and all who have worked on my engines comment how clean they have been. All quick to start in Montana cold weather, always better MPG than manufacturer stated, never overheating, and no oil consumption with age.  I recommend starting from the beginning with your vehicle.  It is an excellent product, even recommended adding a little to your chain saw bar-oil for all season cutting, especially cold weather when bar oil can gum-up."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Noticed immediate difference. Idle is smoother, acceleration is quicker, and cruising on the highway feels assertive with much more power to be had. There was a $10 off coupon for a long time and with prime so I could not refuse. I cannot wait to drive my car again. I feel like Mobil 1 is a brand that does not need to heavily advertise because their product is so good already. It is a trusted brand and your engine is being protected without any second guesses! BMW, Benz, and the GTR use this so why can't yours?!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Bought it April 9th, rebate mailed April 14th.  Today August 20th received $24 for 2 6-pack rebate after numerous phone calls and email scan copies.  Mobil 1 0w-40 is a great product, however their rebate process is way sub par.  I would definitely think twice before such mail-in-rebate deals come up again.  It is just not worth the time and effort for tracking this rebate.  Do yourself a favor, go to your local Wmart to get them for less.  MIR, what a joke."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It is a mystery how such a thin towel can absorb so much water. I know it is the waffle weave that allows the towel to guzzle up so much water... but I can dry a section of my SUV and wring out the towel and then dry another section without having to wait.This towel is a tad expensive and there are other waffle weave towels available, but this makes the drying process for my vehicle take much less time. I simply use the water sheeting technique and this Supreme Guzzler. No blower or anything else!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I puchased this a while back, but I just now ran out of gas while out shopping.  Luckily the car parked next to me had a full tank of gas.  The gas cap wasn't locked so....Calm down, I'm kidding!  I used this for legal purposes and it worked great.  About 10 seconds of shaking and the gas was flowing.  After you get to the bottom of the tank, if you pull out the metal end without shaking or bumping it at all, you can maximize its effiency by not releasing any of the fuel in the siphon back into the tank you are draining.  This worked perfectly and I highly recommend this item."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This thing really does work excellent.  I used it to cycle out old gas in plastic cans into my car.  The new CARB compliant cans take forever to pour because they don't have a pressure hole.  I put the can on the trunk of the car, and put the siphon in each end.  A couple of shakes, and it started flowing until it was empty.  It took about 3 minutes for 5 gallons.What it didn't work for was trying to siphon gas out of my generator back into a gas can.  The gas tank was too shallow and there wasn't enough room to shake the siphon to get a good flow.  If you have a pump with deflate on it, you can still use this to get it started."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I'm a newbie RV person (though I'm 74 years old) so took advice of others on blogs and ordered a 25' and a 50' hose for my new travel trailer.  The threads on the female end are plastic so I'm hopeful they will hold up.  They do have a 10 year warranty.  I unrolled them today and had no kinking when I carefully stretched them out.  Since they were wrapped tightly for shipping I assuming under normal use they will serve their purpose well."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Bought this to use for a camper, It works as a hose, but the ends are plastic.  Initially, I didn't have a problem with this, but at one campground the end was fused to the spigot at my campsite.  I had to use a wrench to get it to release, this damaged the end and I had to buy a new hose.  Also, before this happened it was difficult to get the hose to not leak through the connection.  Defnitely, I recommend getting a hose with metal ends."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had to use quite a stack of wood blocks under my travel trailer (TT) jack because I've had the axles flipped on it.  It sits about 4 inches higher than when it was stock.  When I saw this recommended by Amazon I was all over it.  I still use a few blocks of wood along with this just to further minimize the amount of jack travel required.  I would have given it 5 stars if I didn't have to remove the foot from the jack in order to use it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this jack stand to replace the assortment of wood blocks that I used under the front tongue of our 20' camper, weight about 500lbs,  when parked at the storage lot or while out camping.  By the second season the base had fatigued and cracked in a circular manner and by the third season I had to remove it from service because I felt it would not safely hold the weight of the tongue.  I was pretty disappointed considering how much I spent and inconvenient is was to store away.  I've moved on to the &#34;Flip-foot&#34; jack extension."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If your RV has both the black tank and the gray tank valves emptying into one line then putting this valve in place doesn't work so well because if you try to empty just one tank they both will drain. For instance if your black tank valve is screwed up and you want to leave it open and just use the replacement valve instead of replacing the old one it will work but if you want to drain your gray tank without draining the black tank it won't work because both will drain at the same time. You won't be able to drain the gray tank without the back tank emptying to."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use this to equalize the grey tanks when camping for 4 days or more. In cold weather we take showers in the camper so the grey tank in the bedroom fills up in 4 days.  This lets us divide the grey water from the kitchen with the one in the bedroom.  It also ads a little capacity because it stores water in the pipes down to the valve.  When dumping just take the cap off of this valve, install hose, close both grey valves, open this valve to drain pipes, drain black tank, open both grey tanks again, rinse and done."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this for a small RV modification. My RV has a pretty clunky means of getting our freshwater hose into the water bay--essentially a removable floor pan that has a corner cut out for the hose.  So you remove the floor pan, route your hose, then replace the floor pan with the corner cut-out allowing the hose to pass through.  The trouble with that is that any bends or movement in the hose results in the floor pan lifting out of place.  I wanted something more secure to keep critters out of my water bay, so I'm using this.  I will mount it to a new floor and then screw that floor down permanently.  I have used these before for water hoses, and though it says &#34;electric cable hatch&#34; it will work fine for a standard RV freshwater hose too."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I read all the other companies material on how well their products worked on rust. I had planned on using the POR product but as with several other ones I was worried about how harsh and toxic they were. This product is  water based no harsh fumes and cleans up with water! So far I have used almost two bottles on a very rusty undercarriage. The product works fantastic, isn't scary to handle and the finished results are beautiful. You have to recoat in about twenty min. for the coverage to even out. In 24hours it dries to a hard satin black finish which you can top coat. This product  goes a long way for such a small bottle. A great buy!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Some hardware stores carry this in 8 oz. containers.  It is a buck or two cheaper to order it here and have it delivered.  It works better than naval jelly.  Not particularly recommended for show quality applications.I pour a little our on a 2&#34; paint brush to coat rusted ferrous metal.It stops rust and turns it black.Good for tools and equipment that have a tendency to rust.It is thicker that some of the phosphoric acid products and leaves a coating that can be painted over.I am using it on a rusty utility trailer and an old tractor.You don't have to paint it but you can.It kills the rust."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "used it on a surface on my BMW 328ic near the trunk area. I had 2 little spots approx. 1x2&#34; on the left and right that had rust forming UNDER the rubber gasket... I brushed of the rust with a dremel type tool and metal wheel brush to clear all rust and paint and used this on top. let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat. It does not seem to penetrate the little rust remaining as other products. I used &#34;Rost-Egal&#34; from Germany many many years I lived there and that has been the best product so far. You use it once and just know it works. With this very liquid product I am not so sure... It did not even seem to &#34;stick&#34; very well to vertical surfaces. For the next job I will look for a &#34;thicker&#34; product that will cling more to the treated area."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Purchased this aerosol can when I was about to renovate a couple of corroding, outdoor light fixtures.  After completely taking the light fixtures apart, and using a bit of elbow grease with a wire brush, cleaned the parts, we applied the Permatex Rust Treatment.  Lo and behold, the rust disappeared and a black coating emerged.  Afterwards, we applied a coat of U-POL ACID #8 Etch Primer and two finishing coats of Rust-Oleum, turning the aging light fixtures in brand new ones."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I researched a ton of portable air compressors before coming to the conclusion that the Q Industries, a veritable no-name brand, compressor was the best value - without spending a fortune.  While I think it is obvious your best option for portable air compressors is a Viar, they are also very expensive.  This Q Industries compressor provides me with a relatively quick air-up without a huge expense.  Reviews elsewhere have me convinced it will last a while too.The few times I've used it thus far has me convinced I made a good choice.  I can recommend this one too."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This little compressor has far exceeded my expectations. I have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig. They run forever and have never gave me a problem. The only thing I would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor. This will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools/hoses in a pinch. The one that comes with it is an odd ball size. Don't get me wrong...you can't run air tools directly from this compressor. But using two into a tank makes it possible. I would buy another one in a heart beat. A little noisy but what compressor isn't?! It pushed a decent amount of air for the money. You need one for your vehicle so just buy it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "these look GREAT when mounted, and have been mounted for 6 months with stuff occasionally bumping them without falling off the side of my truck. the glow in the dark nub is removable thankfully, as the orange color is enough to find them in the dark. I tested these at the junkyard to see if they would \"actually\" work (i was skeptical) and my hand fell through the window after it, it took so little pressure. my girlfriend didnt even know I had broken it myself, since she was looking away and only saw the aftermath. I feel very re=assured with these next to me in my truck, and will buy them for any other vehicle I ever own, without a doubt."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Got one of these mounted in my vehicle. Seems to have a quality build and a ok mount. Makes install a little easier, just remember that you'll have to get to this ASAP is something does happen so mount it somewhere you'll be able to get to even if you're upside down. ( Hopefully never ) This is just another one of those \"just incase\" tools that you carry and hope you never need. But better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost."}

I also have the key chain versions (ResQme)as a back-up in case the trapped person cannot reach the one in the door, etc.I have only had to use this device once when a Blazer flipped over on the Interstate in front of me.  The first person on the scene tried several times to break the rear window with a crowbar, but was unsuccessful.

{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff is amazing.  I bought it when RP was running a special; buy the oil, get the RP filter for free.  I was very surprised at how much difference it made over regular oil.  My engine runs a lot smoother and quieter.  I will be buying again.  Next time I think I will buy the high mileage version.  I just hope RP has another special so I don't have to pay for the matching RP filter $$.Update:  After a little over 4 months and 5,000 miles I changed my RP oil.  It looked almost as good as new oil; just a little browner.  When I had tried to do the same with house oil from the parts store it was shockingly dark; almost black.  RP has earned a life-long convert and RP evangelist."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have been using RP products for years.  You can debate oils for days and everyone has an opinion but for me I'm sold on the synerlink stuff they use in their products.  Check out all the youtube videos and you will see what I'm talking about.  I ran my 02 Mustang Cobra hard and never once had any issues with the motor.  I now run this in my Jeep JK because of the extreme cold starts we have here in minnesota.  Yes it costs a lot more to use RP products but from an investment standpoint it's cheaper then major repairs.  I've never rebuilt anything yet that I've ran royal purple in.  Honest."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wanted to love this, but it was pretty expensive for only a few months worth of calendar pages.  I ended up buying a regular weekly planner - 55% OFF! - The Planner - that is 8 1/2 x 11 and has all seven days on the right page and the left page has room to write a To Do List and Goals.  I found this to be more helpful because I could mark each day's eating and sleeping blocks, then also see them side by side - I could see her patterns more easily with a weekly view.  This planner was cute, just not what I wanted."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've been using the baby tracker since the day my daughter came home from the hospital.  We're on the third one now.  It's useful for when the doctor asks how often she's feeding and urinating, but even better for looking at and realizing, &#34;Oh, she hasn't slept in x number of hours.  She's probably crying because she's tired.&#34;  But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule.  I flipped through a couple weeks and looked at when she seemed to be sleeping during the day and looked for a pattern, then started putting her down for naps around those same times each day.  It helps a lot."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've been using this since the day my baby was born (1 month ago) and it is a life saver!  It is a great way to track when I breastfeed, what breast he ate from, how long, etc.  Plus when pee diapers are changed and poopy diapers.  Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day...so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all.  I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate, slept, or pottied.  I plan on ordering 3 more so I have enough to track this entire first year of his life!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have used this tracker for all 3 of my children and swear by it! It is super easy to leave by the baby's changing table or crib and jot down things throughout the day (feedings, dirty diapers, nap times, etc). I also used it to jot down other important &#34;mile stone&#34; things that I would have quickly forgotten&#8230;like outings, temperature readings, visits from friends to meet him, calls to make, when we stopped swaddling him, etc. I was able to use it as a resource when (many months later!) I went back to formally fill out his baby album since I would have forgotten so many of those valuable little tidbits of information & memories."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the \"Notes\" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps \"Dad\" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Love this book! Just finished our first one and am starting a second one.  It makes life much easier knowing my child's meal and nap times. Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well. I recommend this to all new moms! Especially during those first few weeks/months when growth spurts are common and you can't remember anything because you haven't slept much!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old. I was having problems remembering how much she was eating, whether she was sleeping better or not. This helped me keep track of those things and more. I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she's older. I kept notes about her moods, what she did during the day. It even became a good tool to use with my nanny once I went back to work."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I loved this tracker so much, I bought several more and used for the entire first year. It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab.  The bright colourful colours really held her attention.  When she was sitting we played the &quot;Mummy stack them, Baby knock them down&quot; game and &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; with the smaller colours under the bigger cars.  They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on (especially the small green one) when she was teething.  At 2, she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over.  She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game!  Great for learning big and small, colours and numbers.  Good value!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had a homemade quiet book when I was a kid and saw some on pinterest.  Since I don't know how to sew, I visited Etsy to see if I could buy one from that site.  I couldn't believe the prices!  I found this and ordered it for my three kids (9 mos, 2 years, and 3 years), and they all love it.  It's pricey, but it's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others.  Great book, and I love that all the pieces are attached!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is one of my twin sons favorite teethers, but they are only six months old and right now it is too heavy for them to hold by themselves, so we have to sit and hold it in their mouths for them.  This is not a huge deal, and I'm sure in another month or so they will be able to manage, but I just wanted to let other parents know that this is not something you can just hand your baby.  Having said that, when we do hold it for them, they love it and want to gnaw on it for at least 15 minutes or so.  Also, it is different from other teethers in that when they are done using it, they don't seem like they are still in pain and need to go gnaw on something else.  They actually seem like they feel better, so we are able to give them less ibuprofen which I feel is really a good thing."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this as a spare for my original Co-Sleeper. There really aren't a ton of places you can buy these, so I wasn't too concerned about the price. All told, Baby Bungalow did offer it for the best price, including shipping.While the sheet is a perfect fit, I was perplexed by the 'button' holes on the under side of each corner. Can't imagine what those are for. That or my Co-Sleeper is on the older side and there have been design changes since.Overall, quality product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The shipping was quick. The colors are pretty but the sheets themselves are not soft. That was disappointing to my daughter who I bought the sheets for and of course to me. They are not inexpensive so I expected more. I purchased five sheets to go with the co-sleeper I bought her for their first baby. We have not assembled the co-sleeper yet but when I received it the box was all torn and dented. Looking at it the contents looks okay, but we will see when the my son in law puts it together."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a fantastic product. It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this product...  My sister in law has a baby 4 months older than my daughter, and she has a diaper genie.  She is stuck having to buy the special cartridges.  So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.  Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper. With the Diaper Genie, you have to twist the darn thing and it's hard to operate.  My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house... she ends up cutting the bags.  When she's at my house, she can't go wrong, just flip the handle! The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner!!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It makes so much more sense to just use regular kitchen trash bags, more cost effective. It is easier to use. There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well \"hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers\". Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so \"diaper genieized\" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable. I highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I truly believe this is the best diaper pail on the market...  It's simple to use, can take any garbage bag, and does a fantastic job of containing odors.  BUT, my complaint is -- why couldn't they make it bigger?I've heard it's the biggest one you can buy, but I find it frustrating that my regular kitchen-sized garbage bags are only 2/3 full when the Diaper Champ requires us to remove the bag.  It's wasteful!  (I know the simple solution is to buy smaller bags, but I feel the product should accomodate the most common household garbage bag -- the \"tall kitchen bags\" -- and do it efficiently.  The whole point of getting the Diaper Champ was so that we wouldn't have to buy separate bags for it!)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).  I love this diaper pail! My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).  My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.  The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.  Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have three children.  For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky. I would not recommend buying that one.  My second child I didn't get any.  Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.  I have to say that I am very happy with it so far. I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it. I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.  It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.  I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have no doubt that my wife and I will be happy with the Diaper Champ (our first baby is due in two weeks).  But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works.  The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a  piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down).  The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily.  It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn.  This is not one handed operation as the box states.  After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.  And you do not even need to ask.  Yes, it was made in China."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink. of course you have to clean the whole thing out from time to time (which should be expected considering the toxic waste it stores!), but i never had any issues with smell, unless it was so full it had to be emptied anyway. what sold me on this diaper pail vs. the others, is that this one takes ANY plastic bag you want to put in it, meaning grocery bags, trash bags... nothing fancy. as a new mom (or new parent) you have enough things to worry about and spend your money on; last thing you need is to head to the store for diaper pail bags. no complaints from me on this diaper pail."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "ALL DIAPERS SMELL, no matter what you put them in, especially once your kid starts solid foods. Get over it. This pail is fantastic.  We use it for our dogs' poop bags, and line it with Ruffies scented trash bags (we use vanilla, they also have lavender, and they are cheap). There is no smell, except in the summer when it is hot (and that's only because the pail is outside on the back porch, the one we buy for the nursery will be inside in the air conditioning)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this diaper pail...you can use any trash bags...I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch! It's so easy to use. I didn't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months. Once she started eating more \"real\" foods, her diapers became much smellier. She's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ. We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers, but I think it's a great product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This diaper pail is excellent. No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months.  I am very pleased with it.  I do have one word of caution: Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder.  They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside.  Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out. I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why).  Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.  Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag. The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are. I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is another great baby purchase.  When I brought it home, my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a \"gadgety\" baby thing that we didn't need.  He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked!First, it really keeps the odor in.  I'm pretty sensitive to smells, but this one does a good job of containing odors.  Just to play it safe though, I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so (you could probaby go longer), and I spray it with Lysol as well.  Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.  Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain---I definitely recommend this product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Someone told me not to get the Diaper Genie, but invest my money in the Champ.  What sold me on it is that the Champ uses ordinary garbage bags, nothing proprietary.  As my baby gets older and the poops get stinkier, we do have some odor problems, but we tend to cram the diaper bags as full as possible.  If we changed it every couple of days, there would probably not be an issue.  When we smell something, we change the bag; problem solved.  My only *real* problem with it is that, now that my son is walking, he likes to put things into the hole and turn the handle to watch them disappear.  I keep waiting for the day when he throws away something important and I don't catch it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it's sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This one is the best and a must have! Don't waste your time or money on the other ones.  The Diaper Genie is way too complicated.  It's a trash can so it should be simple.  I shouldn't have to read directions on how to use it!  This one is great because it is so easy to use, I never smell any odor, and it uses normal trash bags!  Why spend money on special trash bags?  I like the cheap roll of scented trash bags for like $2.00.  They work great and they are small so you can keep them in the nursery for quick and easy trash changes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We like it that this diaper pail uses regular garbage bags instead of specialty diaper pail inserts/liners.  The mechanism works well to dispose of the diapers and attempt to keep the smell isolated, but at a certain level of the room (usually nose-height when you're sitting on the floor) you can still smell poo.  It works well to bundle the diapers into compact little bundles and use the velcro to seal the bundles before you put it in the diaper hole.  Overall, we are very satisfied."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.  When it came down to it, I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills. Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let's face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!  I think it is great!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills. Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of? I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula. I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, \"Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?\"The Champ works great. We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags. We've never experienced odor from the pail. It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion. I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...Highly recommended!!! Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Diaper Champ came easy to assemble- only took 2 minutes to put together!  The design is simple, yet brilliant, and the odors are sealed inside the Diaper Champ until the bag needs to be changed.  Our baby's room never smells!  We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.  We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!  I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.  It was such a pain to use.  We all hated it.  The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.  And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.  It takes regular trash bags.  I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.  And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!  If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love the Diaper Champ!  Everyone I knew had the Diaper Genie but had to buy expensive refills and did not like all the twisting involved.  After reading reviews of the Diaper Champ, I put it on my baby registry and I am glad I did.  It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.  Also, be sure the tabs on soiled diapers are secured to the diaper or they will get stuck up under the cylinder on the way down."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper.  (Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Unlike the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers. We have two of them since we mostly use cloth, but occasionally need to use a disposable. It's great, and very easy to use, but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers. It's so easy to use, my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun. She's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Love the Diaper Champ.  I had planned to get the Diaper Genie, but after I read the reviews, the Diaper Champ won out!  I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don't have to purchase specific bags.  That's way too much of a headache and expense that I don't need.  It's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven't had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn't want to do without."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib...bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn't fit the crib very well. It is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though. It just has problems fitting around the big 4 corner crib rails so I am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat.Today I just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this. My son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off! AH!  So I improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail, it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on.  It would have cost about the same price to buy an actual[...] rail cover so it works out.  He usually only teethes on 1 side too!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this based on good reviews in the Baby Bargains book, so I had high expectations. It does make it somewhat easier to change sheets in the middle of the night, but you still have to unsnap it from about 10 places on the crib to do so; I've also found the snaps a little difficult to engage. If you're not using crib bumpers, the look of all the elastic pieces on the crib slats isn't too attractive. I'm glad to have one of these, but it isn't the miracle sheet I hoped for."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Here's what I like about this product: it's easy to change, and it provides a leak-proof barrier between the baby and the mattress. Here's what I don't like: the snaps are not a great fit for my crib and sometimes come undone; one snap stopped working altogether; and the sheet wrinkles and is difficult to smooth out.All in all, the good outweighs the bad. The sheet is particularly handy for newborns who might leak during the night, requiring sheet changes when you're half asleep. I only use it now when I know he is prone to leaking, such as when he is between diaper sizes. Otherwise, I use regular sheets. Put it on your registry."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth. Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort: it's made of  lightweight foam. As a result, changing her sheets is also super easy. I just have to lift the mattress, and it takes two seconds. On the other hand, snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus, the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash, which means snap on crib, unsnap, snap again before wash, unsnap, snap on crib...) So, if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room, I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners. If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room, then by all means, try the ultimate crib sheet..."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My mom said to get enough crib sheets because it was something you had to change constantly.... I now have a drawer full of crib sheets that have never been used!  This is the best thing ever!  we put one on, and have the other one for an emergency.  It is soft, the cotton is excellent quality and the work of crib changing at 3 in the morning it just went from 10 minutes to 1 minute! nothing can bit 9 minutes of extra sleep in the middle of the night"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The baby isn't here yet.  But we've bought a couple of these.  I'm a tad hesitant because they don't fit very well on our convertable crib.  They do give instuctions, saying to just use a slate next to the thickers corner one(for convertable cribs), but I find it fits very awkwardly.  However taking the whole crib apart(with the bumper being a huge deal, also to get on, considering the thick corner posts), it makes me want to cry to think I'd have to do this very often.  So, we'll give these a shot.  I may end up doing the zip on sheet set, which would work with any crib, and seems like a dream.  I've also heard great things about those.  I just didn't want to invest in that, if I could get away with these.  Will let you all know, if these turn out to be a disaster."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I thoroughly enjoy this product. It covers the full top surface of the crib, give or take an inch. My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months. The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture. I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet, another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet (since the playpen pad can't be easily washed), and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently. I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it. The snaps work well on small crib rails. They may not fit around larger crib posts. I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib. At 3am, I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "UPDATE: After washing them only a few times, the snaps have been falling off so this sheet is not very sturdy. I now call it a \"disposable sheet\" and would rate it only 3 stars if I was allowed to change the rating.My previous review:This sheet is a fantastic idea. Imagine waking up to feed your baby only to have them spit up and/or poop/pee on the bed sheet. Instead of taken apart the bumper to remove the mattress to change the sheet, all that is required is to unsnap the corners that secure sheet in place. Then you put another one on...the whole process will take you less than 5 minutes. I have three, one for the hamper, one on the crib, and one waiting to be used in case of a bed wetting!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven't used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for the Ultimate Crib Sheet after reading reviews in books and online.  All the praise is accurate!!!  It's better than the standard sheet savers because it covers the entire top of the matress - not just one part.  It snaps securely in place and can be changed in seconds!  I keep the regular crib sheet on the mattress for looks only (matches bumper and skirt) - baby never actually comes in contact with it.  Get two or three Ultimate Crib Sheets for easy changes - SO much easier to change than the regular sheets...removing and replacing the bumper for those sheet changes is a huge pain and time consuming.  This product makes cleaning up so easy!  The only drawback is that it only comes in white, but since it can only be seen looking INTO the crib, it not a big issue for me."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib. I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress, and I've never taken it off. I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets. I have three; I would recommend that number. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets...this is just SO EASY snap, snap, snap and you're done!I never dry mine in the dryer. I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours. I want mine to last, and using the dryer tends to wear them out. I've never not had one on hand, with 3 total."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I thought this looked wonderful in the store so I registered for a couple.  Afterwards I attempted to put a cute sheet and mattress pad in the crib... such a chore!  I started using these and haven't had to change the cute sheet since.  It's so easy to just snap on and not fuss with anything else.  It's a soft sheet on top, an absorbent layer in the middle, and a waterproof vinyl back so nothing leaks through.  I've changed it in the middle of the night in a couple minutes tops... it washes up great with my baby's normal laundry too!  I highly recommend these sheets."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this sheet!  I have 4 of them (2 for each child). It is super absorbent and stays in place! They are great for potty training accidents and for one unfortunate night with the stomach flu.  I used to wrestle with matress when changing the sheets but not anymore.  I have the pretty sheet that matches the bedding on the bottom and the crib sheet on top.  Now if there is a middle-of-the-night accident I just unsnap the cirb sheet, pull it off, and put a clean one in its place.  This is one a the gifts that I give at all baby showers because I think no Mom should be without at least 2 of these (you need a spare!)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The first time I went to change the crib sheet on my baby's crib I understood the importance of the Ultimate Crib Sheet!  It was given as a gift & I put one more on my registry after realizing I had to take the whole crib ensemble apart to change the sheet!  Now I change the sheet only occasionally & it is more for asthetics.  The Ultimate Cribe sheet snaps off & I put a clean one on - so easy & practical!  Save money on sheets & just get one or two decorative sheets & get at least 2 of these!!!Update at 7 mos (July04): I have survived VERY WELL with 2 of the Ultimate Crib Sheets - and boy when they start slithering around the crib & wetting through diapers & spitting up solids - you will be SO thankful to have this little dandy item!  Don't go without!!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought three of these before my son was born and it was money well spent - we bought one cute sheet that goes with his bedding that we leave on and change the ultimate crib sheet as needed. Believe me, when your little one spits up in the middle of the night and you need to change the sheet, you will be so thankfull you just have to unsnap and put a fresh one on. Changing crib sheets with a bumber in place is a major pain! These are super soft, hold up to repeated washing, stay in place and absorb the mess away from your baby. Return all those cute sheets you bought and invest in a bunch of these - you won't regret it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Reality is...you don't have to have this, but it really helps simplify your life if you do.  You don't have to take off the crib bumper and lift the mattress to take off this crib sheet.  Instead, you just unsnap and place a clean one on top of the mattress.  I have a regular crib sheet under the Ultimate Crib Sheet for decorative purposes and in case he needs to be placed on it if my spare is dirty.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's annoying to have to snap all of the straps prior to washing it and also because there is some shrinking that occurs after it's washed (Make sure you put it on the low setting in your dryer).  Also, they are expensive.  I have two of them and it's worked out just fine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had bought this sheet on the recommendation of others from Babies R Us.  The snaps make it a breeze to change, I'm so glad I don't have to take the mattress out of the crib all the time!  The waterproof backing is great not just for the diaper leaks but also for the spit-ups.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the snaps don't fit exactly around my crib rungs so it's a little wrinkled and off center, but my baby doesn't seem to mind."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have never changed the sheet on my daughter's crib.  Instead, I have 2 ultimate crib sheets that I alternate between.  I can't tell you how awesome it's been.  In general, they're easier to change than regular crib sheets.  In a pinch (ie, diaper explosion or sick baby in the middle of the night), they make life SO much easier.  Just fold the sheet up to contain the mess, take it to the laundry room, snap the new one on, and you're good to go.I've read reviews that said they didn't like this sheet, but I love it.  You don't need any other mattress pad with it, either."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I played the game of frustration everytime I had to change a crib sheet......which became much more often after more blow outs and spitting up began!  I knew I wanted to keep the bumper and searched the internet to find a solution.  This was the first recommendation to pop up with rave reviews!  I tried one out and absolutely loved it! Changing sheets is a breeze!  They stay one very well too.  I liked it so much I ordered another to have as back up.  Highly recommended if you are done lifting that dang mattress up!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet is a very useful product.  It protects the sheet, eliminating the need to change the crib sheet if there is diaper leakage or spitting up.  It goes on and off in seconds - so helpful to a Mom, especially in the middle of the night. It is large enough to cover the whole crib surface.  It seems to be waterproof and yet doesn't make the baby sweaty.My only concern would be that since it attaches to the crib rails, there is an outside chance a baby could loosen/undo a strap.I think it would be handy to have two of these to rotate them out.  I like it and would recommend it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When my newborn was in her Co-Sleeper, changing wet bedding every morning was no big deal -- but a move to the crib meant a HUGE daily struggle to disassemble the bumper, manhandle the mattress and strip the sheet and mattress pad, then reverse the whole process after washing and drying. The Ultimate Crib Sheet is truly that: just undo a few snaps and toss it in the wash. It's soft and durable, and your expensive bedding and mattress pad stay fresh and dry. In hindsight, wish I'd had several of these on my registry."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This pad has worked well for my son. He is 3.5 years old and we are trying to potty train him through the night. It's nice not to have to wash an entire sheet and mattress pad every time he has a small accident. It has never leaked and it's been washed many times and still retains its waterproof quality. The only reason I took off one star is because it's a little stiff and he was resistant to having it on his bed at first. He got used to it and now it is working fine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The method that I used for potty training had me completely throw away the diapers and didn't allow for pull ups.  (It worked well!)  About a month after we started my daughter had a string of accidents at night out of the blue.  I was constantly changing sheets and was tired of it, that is when I found this.  Turns out my daughter was sick at the time, but once I got two of these it was so easy to just move her and take this pad off to wash it instead of stripping and remaking the bed.  I wish I had known about this when I first started potty training (for nap time and bedtime).  It is also relatively small to pack if you are traveling somewhere and you are afraid of your child wetting the bed this is great for that too.  I now have this off of her bed again, but I can't say enough good stuff about this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags. That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail. The springs have been popping off since about the first month. My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke, which completely gets rid of the supposed &quot;odor-free&quot; feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either).  Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Yes, my spring broke as well... but looking on the brighter side: when my son is old enough to walk he won't be able to accidently press the spring button to release the pail cover... it's kind of an unexpected safety feature! And yes, you can still open it with one hand... your fingers are not glued to one another. Really, diapers will stink no matter what pail you use.... The covered pail is cheap and doesn't require buying refill bags (especially since we use cloth diapers)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Bought this to keep my toddler from unplugging some important plugs (ie: tv, chest freezer, etc) It works very well and is extremely secure. I actually have a very tough time getting into this. The narrowness makes this not work for adapters or thick cords. And the two small openings at the bottom of the unit are for thinner or normal sized cords only. I had a hard time getting my thicker cords through (the surge protector and chest freezer cord). I actually broke the bottom section that separates for two cords off so the larger cords would go in more easily. When I did this I was actually only able to put one cord per cover. Recommend this just for thin plugs, no adapters. Good buy for the price."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My little guy is very active and loves to get into trouble. We only have a couple items plugged into an outlet that isn't covered by furniture so I purchased these to make sure he couldn't pull the plug out of the wall and get shocked. They are wonderful and I feel much safer letting my little guy explore the house. Even though I am never too far away our let him out of sight he still manages to get into things. He is so fast and just a little distraction could be fatal. But I don't have to worry about the plugs anymore! One less worry and just the little bit of stress relief that makes this purchase very easy for me to recommend it to all parents."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This things install quickly and easily if you're running standard cords (for lamps, etc.) though the holes.  If you want to run something thicker (like the wire on one of my power strips) I found I had to do a bit of modification to make it fit.  I ended up trimming the gap so it was larger on the backside plate and that did the trick.I think the ones I got are more than difficult enough to keep my son from opening them.  I'd consider them on the fence for an outlet that I'd want access to all the time, and someone with arthritis would probably want to stay away."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover.#1: The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover. They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me, I need to go purchase a handful of screws.#2: Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic, small, two-prong plugs. So what won't fit? Our laptops, our phone charger (Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall), iPod chargers, computer charger, power strip plug, light dimming plug attached to lamp, DSLR charger, baby sound machine, Verizon Fios plugs. Well crap... what appliance plugs DID fit, you ask? A lamp. Just one lamp. Oh, and the electric toothbrushes.Useless, sending them back. The Safety 1st units are square (not pyramid shaped) and hold various plugs."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them.  My mom and I each held a side and pulled, but nothing.  I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart.  Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off, I had to leave the latches pushed in, defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off.  Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture.  It's too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in.  I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought and returned the other popular brand of power strip cover because it doesn't fit iPhone/iMac chargers.  This one does.  And it adjusts lengthwise so you can make it pretty long if you need it to.  Some other reviews mention the size of the opening on the top - it's true, it's surprisingly wide, I can usually reach in enough to pull out a plug when I need to, rather than opening the whole thing.  So could your kid conceivably pull one of your plugs out when you don't want him/her to?  Sure, but the cover is also tall enough that it would be pretty darn hard for them to stick their fingers down into the open sockets.  Bottom line: treat this as a deterrent and not a substitute for knowing when your kid's playing with power cords."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "There is no perfect solution to window blind cords, but I think these do well. I actually used this kind years ago for pets. I do usually have to open and close them to unwind, but that is okay. What is important is that they put the cord high above a child's reach. I just ordered many more for the rest of the windows. However, for the kid's room we have the kind that is screwed into to the wall and wraps the cord around, so there is no chance of these plastic parts falling."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have busy almost-two year old twins who are fascinated with the many window blinds in our house. I didn't want to spend a fortune, but needed a quick fix. These did the trick, easy to install, and keep the cords just out of their reach. They do pop off from time to time, but are easily replaced. I've purchased several different brands, and they are all about the same. I wouldn't spend extra money on ones that claim to do better than this type."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "After many years of fighting traditional cheap plastic child safety locks (we have a cat that likes to get into things too) and seeing our son still manage to pinch his fingers in doors (better than getting at chemicals or whatever, but still!), our pediatrician recommended these to us.  They were easy to install, and he can't get the doors open at all, so no pinched fingers or getting at something he shouldn't.  They also have a mechanism to keep the lock in the open position, like if you need to get in a cabinet a lot, or the kids are older and you don't need them anymore.  I would however recommend keeping an extra key around in case one gets lost, or locked in a cabinet by accident."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is simply a great product.  It is installed inside the cabinet so there is nothing to see from the front.  The newer models work even easier than the original ones we purchased years ago.  They open easily when the magnet is put near (don't even need to touch the cabinet door).  We use these in several places over the house and love the convenience, but piece of mind it gives.  They are also pretty strong - our 3 1/2 year old pulls and tries to open sometimes and has not broken or pulled open any drawer.NOTE - The old version needed a drill to make a small hole on the lock which sits inside the door, but the newer ones like this no longer require that hole to be made. These work better and are easier to install - just need a screwdriver and a few minutes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really love this set of clippers. After trying many different brands and styles - this is the one that we love. The blades are dull enough that they do not clip skin but sharp enough to cut sharp little nails. My baby's grow quickly so these clippers are used often. I like that the grip it small enough to fit in my hand easily but not too big to make me clumsy.I love the grip, that it moves with me and keeps me stable so that I only clip nails. It will not work for big people nails, which is nice - it means I can always find it when I need!I highly recommend these clippers to caregivers of infants and toddlers. Hands down my favorite clippers - perfect on the pocketbook too!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I received a different nail clipper as a baby shower gift. It had a plastic cover over the top of the cutting end of the clipper, similar to this one, but with a plain white handle instead of the cute bumble bee:Sassy: Bumble Bee Nail Clippers. It was terrible. I couldn't see my baby's finger nails at all and it wasn't sharp enough.Then I used this Safety 1st Nail Clipper at my mother's house. It was so much easier to use than the other one. The size is perfect for her little fingers. I could easily see my baby's nails and clip them without fear of cutting her. The handle fits nicely in my hand. And the blade is sharp enough to cut the nail off in one clip. I bought one for myself and it's the only one I'll use now."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We had the Summer Infant clippers first.  They came in a two-pack, with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper.  Neither one worked well.  The larger of the two didn't work at all.  These Safety First clippers cut every time.  For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby's nails, you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut.  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!These work every time."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago.  I tried to trim my 3 month old son's nails, granted he is the fidgeting type.  Just as I was about to clip one of his nails, he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger.  His finger bled, my son cried and I panicked.  Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage.  But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company.  They are VERY safe.  I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents.  I shudder to think of using nail clippers again, especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I know that every doctor says an oral temperature doesn't count, you have to take a rectal one.  But seriously, I hate taking my sons rectal temperature.  It is gross, he is squirming around.  Yuck.  This is so much easier. You pop it in their mouth, couple of seconds later, you have your temperature.  I have found it to be really accurate, unlike the ear one, which reads completely different on each ear.  Plus it is so small I bought a second one for our diaper bag.  Super convenient!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When I bought this item, I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby's temperature.  I use this thermometer only on occasion.  It's convenient, but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached.  It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long.  It's getting harder for my baby to accept this \"pacifier\", now that she is on the larger, 6-month-plus sized pacifiers.  Also, check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings: our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My Grandmother got this tub for my 3 month old son to use while visiting. It isn't as spacious as the tub we use at home, which is a little smaller than most tubs, but it folds up nicely, and it feels very safe and sturdy-not flimsy at all. I use both tubs in the big bathtub, so leaking isn't a problem for me. My son seems comfortable, but he prefers to have more water to splash in than this one holds. This tub is great for grandma's house, or if space is tight."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This tub has proven very handy.  My son got his first bath in it at only 3 days old.  I admit, that was a little tricky.  However, in no time we had it down and I was able to bathe him easily anywhere.  Usually we take the bath on his bedroom floor.  I like the portability and the fact that it can fold up and fit under the bathroom counter, since his bathroom is also the guest bathroom.  I also like the little section in the front.  That's where I put the soapy water.  It's easy to rinse him off with a little watering can.  The tub has been great, but now that my son is 17 lbs. it's getting small.  I will be looking for another bath aid soon, but I'll miss this handy tub."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been using this tub since my sons very first bath. At first he hated to take a bath and now he loves it. I love the fact that it folds up very easily and will fit into a closet when folded. I have never had a problem with it growing mold or smelling musty. After the bath I wipe it dry with a towel fold it up and put it in the closet. I also have a newborn to toddler tub, which is very large and I have nowhere to store it.I have never had a problem with it leaking. As long as you don't overfill it, it works just fine. I find this tub to be better than the more expensive ones. The only problem I have is that my six month old son is too big for this tub, but at $12.99, is that really such a big deal? I feel I got my moneys worth out of it. If you are looking for a tub that is safe and easy to store I recommend this one."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you... except that you'll only use it for 3 months  because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space.  As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that.  And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at.  Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this tub after borrowing from a friend because our Four Stage Bath System was so bad it was cutting up my baby's legs.  This was okay - soft all over, no problems like we had with the four stage, however because it folds the hinges tend to leak.  Also, you can't fill it to the level you would want because of the way its reclined.  The back is still very slippery despite the nonslip matt.  We only used for a few weeks before just bringing her in the tub with Mom and washing her that way."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born.  We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she's 4 months old.  I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily.  It does leak at the hinges.  My daughter is very comfortable in it.  Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm.  It does fit in the kitchen sink though.  I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub.  It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher.  She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room. It is a great tub, and a great price!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this as a shower gift. The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub. She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again. I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption. I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here. I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone. Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year....."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm shocked by all of the other reviews on this particular product.  Many complain that it's too small for their sink...hello!!!  It wasn't made for a SINK.  Anyway,...I love this tub.  I wouldn't want any other one.  It was the most convenient when my son needed to be on the sling =perfect=, and now that he's sitting up,... it's even more convenient.  Please ignore the negative reviews and I highly consider buying this product.  It may be the only tub you will buy in you child' early stages."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old. I have not had any problems with the tub leaking. But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times. I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies. The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body. It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help. It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub. I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open! I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want! Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child. And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly. Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day....got another brand...."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Unfortunately, I am not able to find this bathtub anywhere (( My son used to have it 6-7 years ago). It is great! It is the only one bathtub where a baby does not slip forward and doesn't go under water. This blue gear is awesome. I do not understand why it is discontinued. I do not care if it is leaking. I did not notice that because it was used in adult bathtub. IF SOMEBODY HAS IT, PLEASE, I WILL BUY FROM YOU."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It's been 5 months aleady and we've had no troubles at all.  It leaked the first time we used it because I didn't snap the locks into place all the way. My boys are quite big for their age, and they love to kick their legs and splash around. There is plenty of room for that.  In the beginning I put the tub on my bathroom counter, but when they started splashing water all over the place, I put this tub in our regular bath. I don't use the sling anymore, but it wasn't a problem when we did."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks. This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week. I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water. So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks. Really, who wants a tub that leaks???? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub....so we are in an awkward transition phase. a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with. I wouldn't buy this tub."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It leaks every time I use it. It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.  I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.  I love the sling, but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.  If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside, it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.  I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using, I should have.  I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.  Buy at your own risk."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that's what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle \"locking\" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it's worth!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i was surprised to read all those negative reviews regarding this tub.  i had two different tubs before, and i got this one when my daughter was 5 months old, she's now one year old and still uses it.  granted, i never tried to fold it since those few inches don't seem to make much of a difference storagewise, so i don't know if its difficult to do.  i've had absolutetly no leaks with this tub, and the suction cups still work great.  the bathring works great, and can be moved out of the way when baby is old enough to sit alone.  although i still use the bathring so my daughter cant stand up all the time.  it's been 7  months with this tub, and nothing ever broke, or got worn.  i think this tub is great!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "this is the worst bath tub i've bought. i returned this item right away. it leaks. once i pulled it out to be longer but, no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together, it just wouldn't click. when i pressed it to lock the extension, i couldn't tell whether it locked or not, so then i put water to test the lock system. the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.now, i bought the Euro bath. it does a good job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We bought 2 of these, and used them to block off the computer desk from the rest of the family room, and to block off the 7' wide archway between the kitchen and the rest of the house. We soon found that while these are very sturdy and adaptable, they are tall enough that they are a hassle to step over. At least once a week, my husband or I will catch a toe or scrape a shin stepping over. So if you intend to use this fence as a corral, either indoors or out, this is a Great Buy. If you are planning to use it as a fence to block off a wide opening, pay the extra money for the metal version with the gate. you (and your toes) will be much happier."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was initially given this product as a gift for my 9 pound chihuahua. It's great in the sense that it contains him very well. He is very active and likes to jump very high, but he can not jump over the gate. He tries to push the gate in attempt to escape but the gate does not move. The gate is high enough so that he can not jump over. It contains his crate, wee-wee pad and food bowl with plenty of room for him to play around in. I bought a second one to use as a gate to keep him from going up our stairs. Very sturdy product and we plan on using this also when we have kids. One drawback is the gate is a little difficult to open at times in case you want to just walk in. But I guess that is the good thing also so who ever you have inside can't get out."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I recommend getting the extension that goes with this gate to make it big enough.  Our baby never liked to be penned in anywhere, but we use it to gate off the \"band area\" of the basement.  It doesn't need to be connected to itself to function well.  If you do plan to connect it in an enclosable shape, it takes a little getting used to the connection mechanism.  My husband has no problem with it at all.  It's very versatile, and I recommend it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was great for helping me keep an eye on my little one while I worked. I was working from home, and most days I was upstairs and on the computer. Once she could crawl, she started crawling toward everything dangerous. The litter box, the stairs, plugs, you name it, she found a way to get to it. I bought this and it was great! We even purchased the extension kit, so she basically had the whole room, yet was contained. My oldest son even liked to get in with her to play so she was never &quot;lonely&quot;.I also used this outdoors a lot during summer months. My family is big on campfires and cookouts and this was a great way to ensure her safety, yet not have her confined to a play pen!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Initially, I thought this was a great toy. My 5 month old didn't seem to love it, but would sort of press the buttons and screw around with it. Unfortunately, at 6 months, she can now sit up, but has little control over her body. Today, she flailed herself towards the cube and banged her eye socket against one of the corners. She has no injury to her actual eye, but she has a bruise below her eye now, and has been crying all night.I am done with hard plastic. I think I am switching to all soft toys and cubes until she is 1."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My 15 month old still enjoys this toy after getting it for Christmas when she was near 9 months. She didn't quite get it at first since she was so young, but through the months she's enjoyed pushing the buttons, watching the lights go on and off, hearing the music, and now at 15 months knowing that the different buttons do different things. My only complain is that there are a couple of songs that get old quickly, but I guess that comes with every music making toy! I like that it's colorful and the education it provides with the instruments (mommy and daddy are crazy music lovers) as well as the simplicity of the toy. Hopefully she'll enjoy it for a few more months!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new \"upgraded\" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The \"music\" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My 6 month old LOVES this toy!I was thrilled when he went for it immediately in his playpen and was tap, tap, tapping the buttons - he knew the music should come from this tapping, but I had turned it off!  I do think the on-off switch is a blessing for the parents.  But the music is really pleasant, unlike so many toys.Of course the music is electronic, and I think that would be my only complaint.  I'm a very amateur violinist and would like the violin button to truly sound like strings but instead it's very electronic.However, the piano and French horn are quite good facsimiles.Research tells us that early introduction of classical music to children aids in their developing cognitive abilities.  This is a great way to make music fun for kids and I think all would enjoy this toy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My 4-5 month old baby loves this toy.  It is very easy to press the buttons and activate the sounds, so even very young, uncoordinated babies can get this toy to make noise.  As she gets older, she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors.  For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.  Eventually, we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy, where they still are (and we hope they stay there).  There seems to be no way to remove them entirely."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This item has been a life saver for me!  Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great toy.  My 7 month old daughter loves it and so do many of my musician friends.  There is one significant flaw in its design; this is that the volume is not adjustable and it is too loud.  If it were 1/2 this loud, I'd let me daughter play with it all the time.  As it is, I usually limit her to playing with it with me, so I can hold it away from her head/ears.Due to the too loud volume, I'm giving it a 4 star review, instead of 5.  Otherwise, it is a great, great product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "After looking for a musical toy that was not annoying, off-key or obnoxious, we discovered this.  Plays several songs by Mozart; baby can play a song with all instruments at once by pressing \"orchestra\" or one at a time.  Baby can also turn off instruments one at a time. The instruments are clearly synthesized, but still, the quality is not bad and I could listen to it for long periods of time.  I have yet to be annoyed by this toy.  In fact, I may have to buy two - my twins fight over it constantly!  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a little bit loud.  I wish there was a volume control."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This toy keeps my 4-month old's attention for a while - she really seems to like the flashing lights as the music plays.I only wish there was a volume button on it - it seems a bit loud to me (and if it seems loud to me wouldn't it seem loud to the baby as well?), and I wish it weren't quite so heavy.  It will be a long time before my baby will be able to turn the cube or pick it up, for now it just sits on the floor between her legs and she's able to hit the buttons that are facing up/out."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My 4 year old son spotted this toy while we were out shopping for my 4 month old daughter. He couldn't help but play with this in the store and I thought that since my baby loves music so much she would probably enjoy this. I was a little put off by the price. (I paid a bit more than it is here) but it was worth it! My daughter was totally fascinated by the flashing lights and music and I even found myself and my son playing with it together! I'm sure as she gets older, she will really enjoy how interactive it is. Such a cool toy. And the best part? Unlike many other toys that make noise, this one is not annoying at all! The instruments sound so realistic that it's enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this and will probably give as a baby gift in the future."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got it for my 1 year old son.  He likes to push the buttons and listen to the music.  It's sturdy.  He's thrown it a few times already, and it bounced off the hardwood and still works fine.My only qualm with it is that it sounds like the batteries are dying.  Some of the music just isn't the greatest sounding.  Now, he doesn't care, but as a parent who gets to listen to this for seemingly hours when it's his toy of interest, it becomes grating.  I changed out the batteries and it sounded the same.  :-/Given that I know this, I also know that he loves playing with it, and that outweighs my feelings.  I'd get it again in a heartbeat if we ever lost this!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months. He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him. He now plays it himself (13 months). I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery. It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had high hopes for this item based on other reviews, but it was a huge letdown.  It plays one tune with different instruments, and it is too loud for a baby.  With a music background, I really want to expose my son to beautiful, classical music.  This is not the item to do that with.  I will keep looking for other musical toys with more variety and sophistication.Update:  This is still my least favorite toy, mainly due to the volume.  I wish I could turn it down.  Thanks to a helpful comment, I did manage to play all the tunes and felt fairly silly not reading the directions beforehand.  I sill stick with my original rating, though.  There are just so many better toys out there."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I always read reviews on this website and the Babies R Us site before buying a product. This product got great reviews so I bought it - I was not disappointed.I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old. The music and flashing lights immediately captured his attention and, as he grew, he played with it more and more. I keep it in his playpen and it's easily his favorite toy (besides his exersaucer and jumperoo). It keeps him entertained longer than other toys.I like that it's easily washable and has soft rubber-like corners (so, if baby falls on it, no sharp or hard corners to scratch himself on).I also think the music is nice - nothing too annoying like a lot of toys out there. And, with the click of the \"Orchestra\" side, the song changes.So glad I bought this!Update 6/10: My son will be 12 months old this weekend and he STILL loves his Mozart Cube!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones!  If your kid is like mine, however, and likes to sit on the potty \"unproductively\" you might want to consider something a little more comfortable.  The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside.  While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic.  Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting.  Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around.  I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it wouldn't fall into the toilet with a toddler's wiggling around.  You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This does fit on an elongated toilet seat, but it slides around. It wouldn't dump my kid in or anything, but the slipping might startle a child. I may see if I can find some sort of anti-slip stickers. I did not bother with the splash guard, I just threw it out. It looked flimsy and unnecessary. My daughter loves the SpongeBob theme. I'm not so fond of the vinyl seat, as my daughter's hiney sticks to it and is a little uncomfortable when she gets up. But, it's cheap enough and serves its purpose - allowing my daughter to sit on the big potty without falling in."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "this is a good toilet ring, but ONLY if you have the smallest, round toilet seats.  the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit, but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps.  my home has a mix of elongated/round seats, and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls.  we use that for our elongated seats, and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway.  otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The toilet set is nice.  Other reviewers had complained that it did not fit on their toilet seats but I have three different toilets and it works on all three.  It is a nice design and my son love that Thomas, Percy, & James are all on his potty seat.  The one problem is that it does not have a splash guard.  The packaging says it was supposed to have a splash guard and handle to hang on the toilet handle.  It did not come with either of these and when I contacted the seller she claimed they were not supposed to come with the seat.  According to the packaging and description they were!  My son was attached as soon as it saw it so I couldn't return it.  Check when you buy one of these.  If you have a boy you may not want to buy this unless it has the splash guard."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I just started potty training my two year old son and I found the Thomas potty seat to be a great incentive. The seat is cushioned so it's nice and comfortable and it fits nicely on most seats. It's also compact enough to fit in the diaper bag if you want to take it on the go. For boys, it does come with a splash guard. The padded part of the seat lifts up and it gets inserted between the plastic and padding. It stays in place most of the time, but it is easy to misplace. I would have preferred it to be permanently attached, but aside from that I am happy with this purchase."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this product because it was advertised to have a built-in splash shield, which many don't. I specifically researched and looked for one with that for my little girl. It says it has one and the picture shows it. However, the actual product does not have one. I opened the package, thinking it might be inside the wrapping,but no, it wasn't. Now, I'm out $15 and still have to look for another one.Two days later: I am adding this note on and raising my rating from one star to four stars. After I wrote the above review, amazon contacted me within 24 hours and offered me a refund, even if I wanted to keep the item. I was so surprised by the generosity of that offer. Amazon once again has proved itself excellent in customer satisfaction and really checked the reviews to see if they could make the situation better. I really appreciate that and love amazon all the more for it. Thank you, amazon."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Our house is a front to back split. We have a lot of stairs. 5 openings to stairs! These gates have been great for my sanity. At first we bought a big playard gate that we opened up to cover two sets of stairs. I had to climb over that at least 100 times a day! Now we have these walk-through stair gates which are easy to use when holding the baby. Before we also had a gate that just expanded to fit the door way and was attached to walls. I was always concerned my daughter would fall down the steps if the gate gave way because she would pull herself up on it. These gates I know they are locked and they are much sturdier. I like that they slide back and forth; it's easier to get through entries.We used wood that matched our stair case so that we didn't have to drill into the post of our railing. I highly recommend this gate."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this set for my 4 year old and he loves it. The dinosaurs are colorful and there are a lot of them to arrange on the little background. I am happy with the number and look of the dionos, trees and volcanoes. However I give it only 3 stars because the background is small and very flimsy, and the set really smells bad. Every time we open the box there is a very strong unpleasant plastic smell coming from inside the box. Not sure if it's the box it's-self or the contents.  I thought I would air it out a bit so I left the lid off over night, but when I entered the room in the morning the whole room smelled terrible from it. I really don't like the idea of my kid inhaling the fumes of some unknown plastic chemicals each time he opens the set so it now stays open and stored in the garage.  We play with them outside and they work fine for that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "So the container they come in is a little hard to open and close for small children but no less the fact that it comes in it's own organizational container is very pleasing.  The bottom of each of the dinosaurs states what dinosaur it is a model of. I use a set of flash cards with information about the dinosaurs in combination with these dinosaurs to teach my son while we play. These are nothing more than dinosaur figures but they are very accurate with no odd color combinations like purple with pink spots or something silly like that. They are made of hard durable plastic. I think they are slightly expensive for what they are you can buy similar products at the dollar store but those products like the educational value of these ones.  Overall, I would recommend these my son finds them fun to play with and they stimulate his imagination.  I only give them 4 stars because they are slightly expensive."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Comes with 20 dinosaurs, 12 small rocks, a large volcano, a medium sized volcano, 6 trees, and a play mat. This set is great. I would prefer more dinosaurs and less rocks, but oh well. It is still great. My three and a half year old loves playing with this set. The play mat is actually pretty cheap, but my son doesn't seem to care. It is made of really thin plastic and doesn't stay open all the way since it has been folded. Once you put all the dinosaurs on it, though, it stays down just fine. All the rest of the stuff is high quality and the tub is great for keeping everything together. Just for size reference, the brachiosaurus is 6 1/2 inches tall, and this is the biggest dinosaur in the set. I'm really happy with the size of all the dinosaurs. I was worried that they were going to be kind of small, but they are a perfect size."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "As I am wtitng this review my 5 year old son just re-discovered this set, since I had it at the top of the closet. He can play hours with this great quality dinosaurs he got for his b-day. He had a few more, big and small ones that he just added to this set, so it is pretty amazing what he does when he's playing with all of them. The quality of the mat is awful, but you really don't need the mat for this set."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This walker is great for tall babies like my son and the toys are enough to keep him busy.  The only issue I have with it is that the legs don't have a very strong system for holding the walker up on it's different levels.  It is made like an exersaucer rather than having \"x\" bars to go up and down, and one of the back legs won't stay in position.  While it could be an isolated issue, the plastic seems more flimsy than it should be.  Also, only the front wheels swivel which I didn't think was a big deal, but it does seem to hinder my son from going in any direction he wants at a given time."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I recieved a similar model to this walker, one without the electronic tray, for my daughter.  My only complaint is the rear wheels are difficult to roll.  Unlike the front wheels, the rear wheels are fixed and therefore can only roll straight forward or backward, not side to side.  This sometimes made for difficult maneuvering for my daughter. Overall, it is not a bad walker and I do plan on using it for my next baby due in January only because I do not want to purchase another one.  I would not recommend it though.  There are better walkers out there."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "How FUN and AWESOME!!! Got this for my grandson and still can't get over how bright and playful this is. Even I want to get in it and play! The built in activities on the side are the best. The squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby...but the other toys are super! It was so so so simple to put up!!! Love the bigger size, while not being overwhelming...those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most..."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I give this a 5 start plus.My 6 month old Grandbaby  was put in this playpen yesterday for his first time.  It was obvious he really liked it by the big smiles and how his mind was preoccupied with the play items on the sides and bottom. It was a difficult first baby shots day and he was hurting on both legs. The graphics and sides toys kept him more focused on fun & he was able to get some temporary relief.  I know as he feels better he is going to enjoy his new & safe play space even more.Thank you Amazon for this colorful playpen choice at the lowest price and your excellent service. I'll positively be back."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have this playpen for about a month now but is still never used by my 6 month old baby. He cries whenever I put him in. I like it because it is huge and cute. What I do not like is that it lacks cushion. It is hard, not soft that I'm afraid when my baby rolls over, e would hurt himself. I am waiting for my baby to grow up a little more, may be he'll like it when he is already able to stand. I hope he would."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this for our 4 month old son and when it arrived I opened it up myself and didnt read the directions at first I got frustrated since I couldnt get it together then read them and voila it took me and a freind about 3 minutes to set it up! Our son is past the stage where he will stay put in a floor bouncy chair so he loves the freedom of lying in this stretching out,and kicking. We loved it so much we ordered one for my mother in law so she can have in her house when he comes to visit. He also takes naps in it, we are hoping to travel with a smaller version of this pack and play soon...will let you know how that works out."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Just got this playpen a few days ago. It is awesome! Set it up without instructions in under 2 minutes, and I'm 6 months pregnant which makes some things a challenge. It's a very nice size and fits a good deal of toys, though if the room is small it does take up a lot of space. Baby loves the bug toys on the sides. She's just learning to sit on her own and I was very pleased to see when she fell back she did not cry - the floor pad is thick and soft so it cushioned her head. I like that because she did fall backwards once in her gym (placed on the carpet) and was very upset. With this I know if she falls back she won't get hurt. It's very colorful and she really seems to enjoy her time in it. Great purchase!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Still using this... its big and he doesn't mind going in it for me to shower. We also have used it to help him calm down, if he throws a fit we just sit him in with a toy and tell him when he is ready we will get out. Works well, just walk away and he calms down without an audience. Then we get back out, also when I tell him I want him to go in so I can take a shower he goes to it and waits to be put in. So he definately doesn't mind. He likes the toys in it too, wheres the baby (the mirror) was a favorite."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have used it only once to travel, it was easy to asemble, the parts seem to be of really good quality, the colors and decoration are nice. Our baby slept and played in it during our 3 day trip, I was able to move it around the house were we stayed with no problem. The mat seems to be a little thin but a couple of blankets wrapped around it made it seem much more comfortable to sleep in it. Because is larger than the average our baby was very comfortable and had plenty of room to move around, the downside is that it makes it a little heavy, not a big deal unless you're planning to hike mount Everest with it. Fits well in any SUV trunk leaving plenty of space for luggage. Disassembling it was a breeze and packing it was pretty straight forward. I'll recommend this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think this playpen is great; it's spacious, sturdy, and colorful. My 10 month old thinks it's a prison. She will tolerate it for about 10-15 minutes at a time, which is fine because it buys me some time where I don't have to worry about her safety. I first introduced her to the playpen when she was about 7 months old. I think she found all of the characters at the bottom to be frightening, but she was fine after I put the sheet on. I'd hoped she'd grow to spend more time in the playpen, but tolerates it less and less as she becomes more mobile."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the  type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child. There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco, so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits (in the owner's manual) as the regular pack-n-play. Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered, the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily, Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back, but we are quite disappointed."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been looking for the play yard that I had for my children. The other pack and plays are too small. I don't understand why they don't sell these in stores all the time. I live in Hawaii and have been trying to buy one of these for three years. No one would ship to Hawaii. When, I saw it on Amazon. I was amazed and decided to try to order it. I was really shocked as I was going through checkout. And, amazingly they were letting me order it. The shipping was really cheap. And, I ordered it on Sunday and received it on Wednesday. How, wonderful. My grandson was put in there immediately to see his reaction. He is only 6 months old and loved it. Thank You Amazon for having this wonderful product. And, of course shipping it to me. I am going to order one more. Just totally LOVE it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "As soon as I opened the box, I could tell by the VOC's that this playard was treated with chemicals.  I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants.  In addition, some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl...like the entire face of the sun is PVC.  Why would you let your child play, let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew.  I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard.  It's the same size but quite a bit more expensive. The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants.  Definitely worth it to pay the extra $, knowing my children won't be exposed to harmful chemicals."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Buy this Pack N Play!!  All pros and no cons on this.  It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags. Only three parts, just the frame, the folding padded floor, and the carrying bag.  It is roomy, has plenty of padding, and has 9 legs for a strong and even base.  It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Our family loves this product! We used it from infancy to over age one year. It was very easy to set up and assemble the first time. Directions very easy to follow and took only minutes to assemble. It has very easy to clean fabric. Just wipe it down. Baby loved the toys on each side of the play pen and also the colorful block pattern on the mat. The size and height of this product is just perfect. Large play area inside. This product has held up to alot of use for over a year and still looks new! It came with a reusable bag to store it in and make for easy carry in car. Also, we found no safety issues w/this product. I did alot of research before choosing this product and this one meets our high standards. I highly recommend it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Overall I adore this playpen. It is bright, well made and sturdy but the reason I gave it 3 stars is that it has a terrible slope toward the center. Our baby tries to roll over and always rolls back into the center where it is low.  One time she rolled to the center placing her head lower than her feet.  This scared me so I feel we can only use it when we are sitting right beside the playpen watching her. January 2013.  We are still using this playpen and it has held up well.  Our daughter who is 16 months now still loves this and it has no damage after a full year of daily use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can't express how much I love this play yard. My son has been using and playing in this since he was 5 months old and he is 15 months old now. The bright colors, designs, and toys caught his attention right away. When I put him in other play yards we have, he won't stay in it long and wants to come out right away, but when we put him in this play yard he is completely distracted and has fun playing in it with his other toys. There is a lot of space for him to move around and it is very sturdy. I also love how easy it is to set up and take down plus the carry bag makes it easier to bring when traveling back and forth to his grandma's house. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love the size and sturdiness of it! Gives kids more play room than the average playpen. It also holds up well to our large baby playing wildly in it. She loves the various objects on the sides and the different noises and such they have to offer. We haven't traveled with it so can't comment on the transportability. The pad that comes with is not waterproof and even with a thick quilted cover under the sheet tinkle still leaks through to the pad so I suggest getting a plastic cover for under the sheet. Overall a great buy!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm an older mom (40+) who did a lot of babysitting as a teen and remembers what big, square playpens used to be like...not the cramped, rectangular things everyone has now. This spacious pack and play is wonderful! Our 10-month-old daughter loves it - we have it in our kitchen so we can set her in it for a few minutes while we use the stove or chop up food (cases where, for obvious reasons, we wouldn't want her underfoot). She can see us, we can talk with her, and she has plenty of room to practice pulling herself up and walking along the edges (and falling on her bum on the padded floor). When she was younger, she loved playing with the attached toys (especially the butterfly with the crinkly wings).It's sturdy, easy to set up and take down, and packs away neatly into its carrying case. An all-around great product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This playyard is amazing! It's such a good deal for the money. It makes the other playyards look like a joke! Most other playyards are dark and the mesh is dark so your baby can't see out and therefore wants to get out asap. This playyard is really bright and gorgeous, and the mesh is clear so baby can see out. It looks inviting and fun to be in there! Also, other playyards are uncomfortable- no wonder your baby screams to get out- the floors aren't thick enough and the support bars can be felt through the floor. This playyard has a really thick, high-quality floor that is comfortable and baby could sleep on. Also, this playyard is really big- huge!- which makes it way nicer for baby. I am so glad I found this playyard online!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have had this pack n' play for a few weeks now and my son seems to enjoy it.  We use it for quick corralling, not prolonged play time.  He likes the toys on the sides, and I like that it is larger than most of the play yards I've seen, granting that my experience is limited.-It goes up and down VERY easily and quickly.-It is not very heavy for the size and sturdiness.  My parents have a Cosco playyard that they borrowed from a friend for when we visit.  Theirs is about half the size and seems almost as heavy.-The square shape on the TotBloc is nice, too because he can move around a bit in there and actually get somewhere instead of just rolling over once and hitting the end.-There is no listed weight limit on this, only a height limit.  That was a major deciding factor for my big boy!Overall I think it's a great product for the price."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this play yard to put my 8 month old in when I need to keep her contained and safe while I am cooking. It is perfect. The size is ideal as she is able to roll and move around it and play with her toys but does not take up all of the room in our small living area. The pad seems comfy and she will be able to nap in it. The toys on the sides are great, she loves to play with the butterfly. I am very happy with this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We bought it last week and it was so easy to set up - I only looked at the help on the back of the mat once when I could not figure out why the fourth rail would not lock - turned out they do not lock if the floor is all the way back. Pulling the center up just an inch allowed to lock it and the babe went in. He instantly loved it - he can see everyone through the mesh, he loves playing with wings of two butterflies (rattle and crinkle) and  tries to pick the smiley faces from the mat or kiss them. At 7,5 months old, he enjoys up to an hour  in it playing there on his own (he is not really crawling yet but learned to sit up on his own and can roll around it to reach toys and wings on the side panels. I read some reviews that the floor is not too even, but I did not notice it with mine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great play space for our son! We have a sizable great room, which is child-proofed and gated off from the rest of the house. But once our son started crawling, we needed a safe place to put him while working in the kitchen. We had a regular pack-n-play, but it seemed cramped. This is perfect! It's roomy enough for him to spread out with a few books or toys, and entertain himself for long enough that we can put away groceries, cook a meal, or do a load of dishes. Everyone's happy!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this pack n play!  The other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us (and they were twice the price).... It was the one with a changing table and bassinet.  I finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger, boxier and roomier. My son hates restraints and being boxed in, but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play, and is willing to stay in it for 20-30 minutes at a time (a record!).  And he is 2.5 now, so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere...."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have this one and love it. My son typically doesn't like a pack and play or even to be in the crib too long. But, it is great for those days when they are small and you want to be outside at an outing and don't want to have to sit and hold your child all day. When my son was a little baby, we pulled out the mat and hooked up the toy dangler and he was amazed for hours. My son is now 14 months old and we recently took a 3 day vacation and took it along. We set it up in the hotel room and it worked perfectly. It also saved us the money of having to rent a crib at the hotel. He likes all the animals on the sides. Not to mention, what a dream to put up and take down. We have an older model pack and play and it is very hard to get the sides up and down. This one is so easy! Highly recommend."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I rated this 3 stars because while it has many good parts, I was highly disappointed to \"realize\" when my baby was 4 months old that this set does *not* include any medium flow nipples. We used the slow flow for several months, so those were useful, but the Fast flow were way too fast and we needed something in-between.  Low & behold I walk down the aisle in Target looking for an entirely new bottle system and I see medium nipples that work perfectly for my daughter.  For trying to offer a variety of nipple options, Playtex missed the mark in omitting the medium flow nipple."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm so glad I chose the Playtex drop-ins system. It is so easy to use. I pump directly into the liners using the playtex storage set and freeze. Then I can just thaw and pop the liner onto the bottle holder and screw on the nipple. The selection of nipples was nice to have, though my guys would take any of them-he isn't picky. I haven't used the tall liners yet though, maybe that is more useful if you are formula feeding? For breastfeeding I recommend the pump and store set and you will be all ready to go!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Great set, but you'll need more nipples. At least 2 out of the 5 are Fast Flow, which I didn't use until my baby was 8-9 months old. The nipples are like $4 for a 2pk, so add that to the cost when comparison shopping.Other than that, I love these bottles! I don't have a single complaint about them. I do not use a bottle warmer. They do leak in the diaper bag when not kept upright, but I store mine upright, so that's a non-issue."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter wasn't drinking out of the bottle. The laytex nipple was the only one shes takes. Its soft and is the most like a breast. But  I  didn't know why she wouldn't drink the bottle until I smelled the milk.  It had gone bad. So I learned that if you heat the milk ( not boil it) right after you pump then store it in good bags the milk stays fresh, and baby eats while i'm at work.  There is no better feeling for you (and grandma whos watching her)  when you know that shes happy while you are at work."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I only used these with my first child, now 7 years old.  I am pregnant with my 2nd and with certainty, will use these again.  Why they are amazing:1.  The liners are so convenient.  You use them then throw them away.  No bottles to clean (build up of disgusting old milk, especially on those long trips outside in the spring/summer), and you don't need a lot of bottles, I had two of each (2 x 4 oz and 2 x 8 oz bottles).2.  After mixing the formula or using expressed breast milk, simply squeeze the liner from the bottom of the open-ended bottle and all the air is out!  This lessens the gas and projectile vomiting.3.  Many options of nipples and they are the only thing you need to wash/rinse/sterilize.A lot of my friends use Dr. Brown and they rave about it, but after I talk about the Platex system, they are sold."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought these as burp cloths for my two boys.As burp cloths they are great - nothing fancy, just good at absorbing the spit up.  The fancy burp cloths are usually too flimsy (won't lay flat on your shoulder) and too thin to be helpful.  These stay in place without having to touch/fix it.I have tried them for cloth diapering but it seems they don't hold very well and leak more than the other diaper inserts I've used. I usually don't cloth diaper so I can't say too much on this - this is just from the few times I have used it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are by far the BEST burp cloths around.  I got several different kinds at my baby shower.  I ordered these after reading the reviews because the ones I received at the shower were paper thin.  These are fabulous.  I buy them for every baby shower I go to now.  The middle panel is very thick and helps with a newborn that spits up a lot and those breastfeeding blunders that happen to a new mom.  I highly recommend them.  They are worth the money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got 2 of these at my baby shower (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) and I absolutely love them! They steam pretty quick and I like how you can keep pre-measured water on it. When baby's hungry I just grab the bottle from the fridge, grab the little flask of water that's attached, pour it in, and press the button. I've had to warm bottles twice sometimes but it's still faster than warming water on the stove or running the bottle under the faucet. Oh, I only do 2 oz. bottles for now."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been using this product for almost 7 months and yes, its true the little cups DO NOT WORK for warming bottles, I tried them for 1 week until I started using my own cup and I just pour the water in and now I know about how long it will take to warm, works great for me. I never had a problem with scalding my baby's mouth because I always check the milk temperature on my hand BEFORE giving it to the baby. Overall, I live in a two-story house and this warmer is a lifesaver for those early am feedings, I definitely don't want to go downstairs to warm a bottle, the product works consistently if you figure out how much water you need."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is an awesome product!  Once you get used to using this product, it is a huge timesaver.  It took us three tries to get the amount of water right so the bottle would be the right temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  Before going to bed every night, we put two bottles and the ice pack in the cooler section.  When the baby woke up, we transferred one bottle to the warmer.  It was usually done warming before we finished changing a diaper!  You may want to order an additional ice pack so you'll always have one ready in the freezer.  This bottle cooler/warmer makes it easier at night when you want to get back to sleep as soon as possible!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "A dedicated steam warmer is definitely better than any other option such as a pan of water on the stove (takes too long) or the microwave (danger of uneven heating;  robs contents of nutrients).We have ours in a second-story nursery and have been pleased with it.  The only problem is that the results can be unpredictable - sometimes one capful of water will do the trick just fine, sometimes the bottle feels hot but the milk inside still cold, and sometimes it just goes to town and overheats the contents.  Nonetheless, I figure any heating process will be unpredictable, so I can't fault this model.The unit comes with adapters to hold any standard 4- or 9-oz. bottle;  we've used Avent with no problems."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can't speak highly enough about this chiller/warmer.  Every night I know I will not have to go downstairs to get a bottle, warm it, and bring it back up while baby is crying.Now, all I do is take the bottle from the chill compartment (complete with ice pack), and place it, with a capful of premeasured water, in the warming compartment and hit a button.While I change baby's diaper, the bottle is warming, and I am ready to go.  This equipment has been a godsend.  Actually, I can't think of any equipment that I could live without less.No complaints whatsoever about this great bottle warmer."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Ehh, I bought this product to avoid my MIL using the microwave to heat bottles. The thing is that it really depends on the amount of milk and size of bottle. The warmer starts right away and creates a lot of steam. What i found is that a cold bottle from fridge would heat up a lot on the outside but a couple shakes and it would still be cold. I didnt find it evenly heated it through.Its still best to just sit it in hot water for a couple mins. :)But we will use this to keep cool bottles in the freezer pack in the back (remember to freeze the ice pack)-Overall, save your money and use the traditional method."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If you are pumping breast milk or formula feeding this thing is a lifesaver.  We've used this warmer for 2 of our babies and love it.  It's super convenient to have 2 bottles nice and chilled.  If you read the instructions the warming is pretty much fool-proof but on occasion I've been sleepy and overwarmed a bottle.  As I rule I always test the temperature anyway so it's never been a real problem.  Make sure your lids are off or loosened when you warm the bottles (especially Dr. Brown's) or the milk will come out of the top and make breast milk caramel all over the heating element.  :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The design is convenient, except for the water holding tubes which can be annoying to clip to the sides.  Otherwise, having a cooler right there is nice.  Note that it keeps the bottle COOL, and NOT COLD.  You can order replacement/extra ice pack on Tomy website - we keep 2 extras in the freezer as we constantly were forgetting to refreeze the one we had in preparation for a new night (they were $2 each).  Heating is a bit inconsistent and seems to be slower than the quick pro model by the first years.  Overall, good purchase and the price is great on amazon (you'll pay $30 at BRU)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can honestly say I love this bottle warmer because it is very convenient for those in a 2-story house.  We loved being able to keep the bottle cool and save the trip downstairs in the middle of the night.  Even when my son was sleeping through the night we still kept his morning bottle in his room and used this warmer to keep it cool.  But...I was very disappointed that my Dr. Brown's bottles were too wide for the warmer.  The taller Dr. Brown's bottle fit in the warmer but were too tall to fit in the cooler.  I ended up still using the cooler but storing the Dr. Brown's bottles in there without the nipple and cap on so they would fit.  My only suggestion would be to make the warmer wider so all bottles can fit."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I loved this product from the moment I got it. It works wonders with drop ins, And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely.... Sometimes that is. We have been using this with ourDr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile. Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate.... Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently. We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day, four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over. Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish. The instructions are basically nonexistent. All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Our bed rooms are upstairs and I needed to have a second warmer and one which had a cooler.This is the best buy for the same reason.I simply love it and couldnt live without it.I have used it every single day so far .My son is now 5months and it works great I never timed how much time the bottle is in the warmer not I measured the water. I used to do it when I intially bought it but with a screaming infant in hands during night I stopped bothering about the measurements . even with such a rough use it still works great .never had a little problem with itBut I do make sure that I clean it throughly every week.The cooler part is awesome,saved me trips downstairs in the middle of the night.Being a working mom I am all about making things easy for me.This is what I recommend highly"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this pump for occasional use since I am a sahm.  As recommended by our lactation consultants, I pump once a day.  I sit in bed with my daughter nursing on one side and me pumping the other.  I am able to get 6-8oz in one sitting.  When I pump w/o nursing at the same time, I am still able to get 4oz in 15-20 mins. Being a sahm, I cannot justify spending the $200 for a double pump when I just don't need that much help.I highly recommend this if you are a sahm and can pump whenever for however long.  I pump once a day and after a week of that I have 2 weeks worth of feedings(if giving once a day)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It does the job, but does it make the loudest noise doing it.  My husband said it sounded like I was milking a cow.  I would have opted using a double breast pump, but it was much more pricier.  After two months I found that it was harder to express breast milk using the same suction as before.  I don't know why.  The pump was fine and working the same, even at the highest level, my breast would not fully be expressed.  I had to just ditch this item in the end."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I received this pump as a gift.  I like it because it is electric.  I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading.  For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis.  However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump.  This works great.  It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples.  Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples.  It is a pretty good buy.  It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it.  :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have the larger, double Pump In Style but I wanted to leave that at work and still have something at home.  I used this to pump in the morning before going to work or if I was unusually full.  It's small and light and perfect for travel.  I'm now onto baby #2 and use this occasionally since I'm now home full time, but this works so well when I need it.  It's efficient and has lasted through 2 babies - Medela is a really great brand!  I wouldn't recommend this if you're pumping often from both sides - get a double pump, but it was a perfect supplemental pump for me."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got *seven* extensions for this and put a fence across our den, marking off a one-hundred-square-foot area for the lil'guy to crawl around in. I was worried that the length would make it insecure, but it doesn't: Just be sure not to have the fence completely straight; use the nifty connection corners to alternate turns, using either angles back and forth or a serpentine pattern. Then hang stuff like toys, instruments, and mobiles from it. Our lil'guy loves it! :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We bought this gate for a opening between our foyer and kitchen. We ended up buying one extension and are very pleased!!! We put it together in about 30 minutes. It's great because you can bend it into whatever configuration you need. For us, we were hesitant to drill into our walls but didn't have another solution. Now that it's installed, we definitely feel like the safety and convenience factors far outway the problem of drilling into our walls.  I definitely recommend this gate!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this gate!  We have a spiral staircase that continues for 3 floors and it was almost impossible to block off on the second level.  This gate has solved all our problems.The door does not swing closed behind you, which I like.  The bar across the bottom of the door is very low compared to other gates, about an inch.  When the door is closed it is secure, much more so than our gate that swings shut behind you.  The entire system spans 72\" and is very stable, even when my 1 year old shakes it.This gate is a great solution for difficult areas and is well worth the money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have this gate set up in two different parts of my house... one part as-is, and one part with two extensions. The gate that that has no extensions is very durable, and easy to open, however there is a bar that goes across the bottom of the \"door\", and myself and my guests are always bumping bare toes on it...ouch!In the other part of my house, I have this gate with two extensions. It's such a LONG gate, that there is no stability... the whole thing kind of sways, and my toddler finally was able to pull it out of the wall. There aren't many gates out there that will let you cover such a wide room, though, and for that it was nice while it lasted."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have used several other gates to block off the stairs in our home and have been frustrated with them all. My husband and I wish that we had ordered this gate a year ago! It was easy and quick for my handy husband to install at the base of the stairs. The gait opens easily with one hand (the trick is to pull the latch and then LIFT the gate just a bit, which we didn't know to do and initially caused us to think the gate was defective until reading the directions. This feature is nice as our toddler can pull at the latch but can't lift the gate to open it by herself). The gate is also fairly wide, allowing us to pass through it easily, even when carrying things. The gate automatically swings shut, which is convenient, but will also stay open if opened to 90 degrees. Would highly, highly recommend this gate!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I run an in-home daycare in a townhouse in addition to having my own young children.This gate is by FAR the sturdiest gate I've used and it is my absolute favorite.  I have 4 different baby gates.  We used it in a previous home to surround the fireplace but have it in use for keeping children in the playroom across a large doorway now.The gate is attractive, too!  I don't feel like I'm keeping the children \"trapped\" like with other gates.My only issue is that my oldest daughter figured out how to open the gate at the age of 2.  However, by then she understood and obeyed when I told her WHY she couldn't go through the gate.This gate is also taller than the average baby gate, which I love for my 12 month old climber.  She stacked pillows and climbed over the first gate I installed in that doorway."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have used this gate since our oldest started moving around. Now 3 years and another child later it is still functioning great! It still looks and works as well as on day 1.We picked this for the top of our stairs so we could have a \"landing\" at the top. We did not like other gates where you have to balance on the top stair, with a baby in your arms, to open or close the gate.It is easy to open, but not for little ones. My 3.5 year old still cannot open this on his own.I would buy this same gate in a heartbeat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have been using this system for about two months now.  We have 2.5 walls in what was once our dining room (now play room).  We used 4-5 extensions as well.  We bought this new, and it was easy to set up.  Be sure you install it into the studs - infants will pull up on the railing.  Kidco is pretty easy to work with.  They sent me free \"templates\" for the wall and I bought some screws (for another gate).I LOVE this system.  The quality is great.  I recommend it and would purchase another if needed."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have really enjoyed having this since my son was born.  We do not use the heartbeat or music setting, but he seems to like the other two settings which are more 'nature oriented.'  I love the automatic shut-off and the voice-activated modes.We have gone through one set of batteries already, but it took seven weeks to do so.  (That includes a few nights/naps that I forgot to press the automatic shut-off)  Overall this is a great product and very useful."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was a little woried about buying a metal crib, but because it was mutch cheeper than the wooden moddles I baught this one. I love it and so does my son. We have had it for over a year. It hs traveled with us, Surved as play pin, and iven was used as the main crib for 3 monthes while we have no room for a big crib. I do wish it were a little easier to fold and ajust, although the litle buttons are stuck in mine it still works and is very safe. Should offer maybe 1 mor hight? I like that the bottom of the ligs are removeable, the description doesn't say that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!) My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal! I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib. And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have had this from the day my daughter came home from the hospital and it has held up in the wash. No major accidents on it but the few there were are due to my not folding up the stinky diapers all the way or her spitting up. Washes well and never shrunk for me. If you are washing it on warm your water temp may be too high(hot water heater) so that may be causing it to shrink. I love mine and it is softer now then first use and it is secure so she does not slide like when we tried a towel on the changing pad.Have had the same 2 since February and look like new. Would have given this 5 stars but this is not as soft as I had hoped...maybe expecting alot from terry cloth."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).  They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket. There was nothing &#34;UltraSoft&#34; or &#34;UltraThick&#34; about this mattress pad, if you could call it that. It's probably the first amazon purchase, after a couple hundred, that really left me disappointed. You're better off putting a thick, soft blanket under your baby's crib sheet if padding is what you're going for. As a mattress protector, it might be good. As a quilted pad to make it softer- it's useless. The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to. My 7 month old wouldn't have even noticed a difference. He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he's older. Guess I'll have to keep looking."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  We didn't have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  The crib sheet alone wasn't enough to keep him from sweating.  This pad is also not too bulky so it doesn't cause a safety concern.  Just make sure the pad fits TIGHTLY on YOUR crib mattress for safety's sake.  We have a Sealy Crown Jewel Mattress and it fits great on it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles.  I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable.  Well, they are.  They also have more nipple selections, depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle. I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz. cup holder, these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these, couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts (have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchsed these bottles on a recommendation from a friend who was breast feeding as well.  The fact that the nipples were to more mimic the breast than others was great and the fact that you could use the bottles as storage containers when pumping was even better.  When I first had my daughter, we had to put her on a bottle a week after she was here to help me have time to heal.  She was getting one bottle a day and was having no problem going back and forth from breast to bottle regularly.  The nipples are great because they force the baby to suck on them as if they were the breast.  The nipples are not supposed to be shaped as the breast but force the baby to latch the way they do on the breast.  I swear by these bottles ans will not change to any other bottles for her!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "HI, I HAD THESE BOTTLES BACK IN 2002 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL GAVE THEM TO US TO USE TO FEED THE BABY. I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT MORE WHEN I GOT HOME, I HAD NOTHING BUT LEAKY PROBLEMS!!! I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO \"TALK ABOUT IT\" I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING. THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY. THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN. I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED!!! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CANNOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET!!! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT, NOT, NOT, BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i have zero complaints about these bottles. wish i had bought them in the first place (i started out with the playtex nurser system). they may be pricy compared to other bottles, but, you don't have to buy liners for these bottles. my daughter found these bottles much easier to hold herself than the playtex ones and these have a bigger selection of nipple flow to choose from (besides slow and fast, where fast for playtex really just means not so slow), so i put them away and got more of these, and my daugher was a much happier baby.what i found with the leaking some people complain about: if there is any liquid in the seal it will leak. this problem can easily be solved by wiping the inside of the ring that holds the nipple and the outside rim of the bottle with a dry rag, and if it squeaks when you screw the lid on, you're not going to have any leaks.hope this helps!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "In my opinion the Avent bottle system is superior to any other product on the market. The disposable system works great for storing and freezing milk and it's convenient for Mom's on the go. My only mistake was not buying enough bottles in the beginning when my son ate eight times a day. The bottles are designed to reduce gas, and seem to do the job. The one slight annoyance with the system, you have to place the ring on the lids directly on top of the nipples; otherwise the bottle has a tendency to leak.F.Y.I. - I purchased the adjustable flow nipples when my son turned three months old as recommended, but nowhere in the product information does it tell you that you are supposed to line-up the Roman numerals of the nipples directly in line with your baby's nose to adjust the flow. This makes sense of course, but I had to call the 1-800 number to discover this 'little' detail."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I decided to use these because I wanted the Avent Breast Pump and would use these with it.  Well, my newborn had a hard time latching onto the nipples and when he did they were way too fast with the flow.  He would choke and gasp almost everytime.  I now use the Playtex Ventaire bottles and he doesn't have as much of a problem.  Every baby is different, though, but if you have a baby that tends to want to eat quickly, these won't work so well."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter was born 3 & 1/2 weeks early and had to stay at the hospital for a week, she was lazy at the breast but did great with these bottles which came highly recommended by a friend.  I only have an ocassional problem with leakage when you twist it shut it seems that every 1 in 10 times it leaks.  I don't mind the leaking except that it takes several tries to re-twist it before it stops leaking.  I hate losing precious breastmilk to leaks, thats why I gave it only 4 stars."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've only tried the 9oz bottles and they leak for me alot. It's really annoying since I spent so much money thinking that they were quality. They also make alot of noise when my son eats. And he doesn't like the nipple, it's too thick for him to get a good suction. One thing that is good is these bottles don't give him gas which I've tried cheap bottles and he gets gassy with them. After trying alot of bottles the only brand I have absolutely no problem with is the Dr.Brown bottles. They are just the best. But they have extra parts to clean which is a pain."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time.  We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved! No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings.  The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings.  So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants.  Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples. well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window. my daughter had  very bad gas. when i switched bottles the gas stopped. Plus the bottles are  expensive......you  have to keep buying new  nipples there are sooo many different sizes. a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I admit it: I am impressed with Avent bottles! They are easily one of the baby products capable of handling extremes without a blink. Example: microwave sterilize them and after a couple of minutes, pour a stream of recently boiled water; mix with formula and put next to the ice bin in the freezer for five minutes. Do this with your average bottle a few times and be ready to say bye-bye to them, but Avent bottles hold on strong and in the process also happen to offer the best bibs in the market (the ones that best mimic the nipple, thus giving your baby the least gas, if you feed the bottle perpendicular to his/her mouth). No wonder they've been voted among the best baby products for several years in a row!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I understand that some people might have a problem with this bottle type. If you screw the top on crooked at all or too tightly - you may have issues. But if you take a second and make sure that you are screwing on the top properly - you might have a leaking bottle once every 30 or 40 tries. I have used 4 of the other top brands and am very pleased with Avent. The Brownies are really good too - but just too hard to clean on a regular basis. If you only use a bottle once in a while - use browns - but if you use them a lot - get Avent. Only way to go."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This brand of bottles was recommended to me by a certified lactation specialist when I was having trouble with low breastmilk supply and was forced to supplement.  It was extremely important to me to be able to still feed my baby by breast and I was afraid that introducing a bottle to my daughter would cause her to lose interest in me.  I was told that this brand of bottles was created to closely imitate the breast and this is the only brand that you can easily switch baby back and forth from breast to bottle.  And it has worked wonderfully--my baby girl will feed from both without any problem.  I love the shape of the bottles--very comfortable to hold--and they are extremely easy to clean.  Out of the four 4 oz size bottles I own, one of them has a leaking problem, but I can usually solve it by loosening or tightening the cap.  My daughter has no problem sucking from the nipple, as one person reported.  These bottles are great!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them. I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line. After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him..... I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used these bottles with my son and loved them!This bottle system was excellent and my son almost never had any gas with them like he did with some others I tried out.  He took right to them as a newborn and I didn't have to encourage him like I had to with others.The wide mouth is so nice and makes them so much easier to wash.  The nipples and bottles are extremely durable and held up for a very long time.  As my son got older, I had other bottles I would use for him, but he always preferred the Avent ones.I never had problems with leaking like I had read about, so I don't know much about that.  But there was absolutely no leaking here!There is a great range of accessories that go with this bottle as well, including sterilizers and breast pumps.  Everything was compatible with my Avent breast pump and it made it a dream to use.I am pregnant with my second and Avent is all I am going to buy for her."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love these bottles.  My Amelia is hardly every gassy with them.  As for the leaking issue, it is Not the bottle, it's the user!Bottle use de-mystified: you MUST  make sure that the top of the bottle and its threads are DRY and the flange of the nipple on the inside is dry as well.....then when you tightly screw on the cap it should make a soft squeak sound that perfects the seal. If either are wet or have milk on them (like when you open it to re-fill a partially full bottle) you must re-dry the threads and nipple before screwing closed. Motto: \"IF you don't hear a squeak, it's gonna leak\".  Good luck."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.  Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.  The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.  We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.  The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.  Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck.  I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow.  You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer!Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle.  So, if you've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste!  The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find!  Good Luck!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Avent brand of bottles is an outstanding product.  For those experiencing leaks, it is simply because the bottles are an interlocking system and must be screwed on properly.  I have had no problems using these bottles, and yes I have experienced an occasional leak which I notice while I'm shaking the bottle because I have not screwed the cap on properly.  These are well worth the price paid.  I have tried both Dr. Brown's and Playtex VentAire and find the Avent products to be superior to both of these.  Highly recommended by this mom!Update March 06:  one more great feature about the Avent bottles -- they sell a sippy cap that can replace the nipple, so your investment goes into toddlerhood with no need to buy additional sippy cups!  They are leakproof, and come in a 2 pack just as the replacement nipples do.  I have found them in Toys R Us, since my local Babies R Us does not carry them.  Still a great product in my book!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have to agree with reviewers, the nipple of the Avent bottles is great. It's obvious watching my baby that he latches on similar to the way he does on the breast.The problem is that the bottles leak like crazy. My little guy ends up wearing as much milk as he drinks. I've tried all of the suggestions, but have had no success in making the bottle leak proof. I've had to go out and buy different bottles with nipples I don't like as much just so that I don't have the mess."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Avent bottles are one of the best out there. Handy and easy to clean. They protect your baby from getting gas while he eats. But if your baby is really gasy and has colic, I recomend you the Dr brown bottles. I suggest you buy or register for both (avent and dr brown)so if your baby does ok with gas and colic you use avent, and if not, you use dr brown (at least for a while). You will notice the difference in a few weeks. But I most tell you avent work very well with gasy babies, so if you dont want to invest too much  money in bottles, avent will do great."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great. He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast. We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you. So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "A lactation consultant recommended these bottles to me. I bought one to make sure my baby liked it before buying more. I didn't want to hassle with the disposable liners. I feel my baby doesn't swallow as much air. A lot of babies are gassy and I wouldn't blame it on the bottle.  I also like the idea of the different sized nipples to adjust the flow.  I have only used size 1 because we need her to slow down; she eats to fast and gets a tummy ache.These bottles also fit perfectly in my bottle warmer (the first years) excellent choice!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really like this pump.  Works great sort of a pain to clean but easier than having to clean tubing on an electric.  The bottles however are junk.  After one use they leaked from under the plastic disk.  EVERY bottle I have leaks.  In order to stop it is a pain.  I pull up on the nipple and roll it around clockwise to make sure it's in there right, then I use a rubber gripper and tighten the crap out of it so it won't leak.  What a PAIN!  I sold my lot on ebay and replaced them w/ the Playtex vent air.  I did save one bottle so I could pump into it though."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter was in the NICU the first day of her life, and then the special care nursery the next few days, so I had to use the hospitals electric medela dual breast pump to express milk. i returned home and rented the medela for a month and hated it. It HURTS my nipples. My friend got me this Isis breast pump kit and I tried it. I LOVE it! I used it since my daughter was about 2 weeks old. I doesnt hurt my nipples like the electric breast pump does as I can control it with every squeeze. It doesnt hurt my wrist (as one might think.) I only supplement my daughter with one bottle of EBM at night. It takes me 10-15 minutes and I can express 5 ounces with this pump! I LOVE IT!Oh, and it is virtually silent so I can pump one breast as I breast feed my daughter on the other!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It's a great manual pump, but it's just a manual pump after all. Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk. It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day. However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies (like the time I forgot my other pump at home) or for out-of-office meetings (because it's small and discrete). It's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my \"let down\" and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "After trying a dual electric pump that was very uncomfortable for me I tried the Isis berast pump and never looked back. I could not control the suction with the electric pump and,  however with the Isis I was able to control the pressure and was able to completely empty both breasts in less than 20 minutes total. The cushioning made the pump very comfortable. And my hand never got tired from manually pumping. I used this product years ago with my daughter and I am adding it to my registry for my second child. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to continue breast feeding.Follow-up: My youngest daughter is now six weeks old and I still love this pump. Its a moust-have for breastfeeding mothers."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I would have been okay with just the table corners. I have a glass table and I was worried about my 1-year-old niece visiting.The corners helped a lot as did putting a tablecloth over my table. There was no way the table guard was going to work around my glass table even with the tape included though. It's for a much thicker table and my glass table was too thin.Also, my niece is still crawling so the guard wasn't necessary. Even when she stood up, she couldn't reach the table and she was safe as houses in her booster seat and high chair."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The title says it all...the edges of the bumpers were very tempting for my daughter to peel every chance she got. You'd think her ability to remove the ends of the bumpers would indicate the bumpers would be easy to remove.They were a nightmare and have ruined our beautiful coffee table. I've tried goo gone to no avail. If anyone has any tips how to get the tape off, which is coated with random pieces of foam from the old bumpers, I'd love to hear them. I can't believe how awful my table looks."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I needed a solution for a sharp tile step down into my living room- every time I stepped down I envisioned my baby cracking her skull on that :( I was hesitant to buy this, though,  because I was skeptical that it would stick and chocolate seemed like the wrong color to match my tile. It sticks really well- we'll see how it holds up over time- and the color looks great against my taupe tile. It really doesn't look cheesy at all. We're going to use the corner pieces on a table of mine and I've already checked the color there too. Not great against some sort of reddish brown wood, but miles ahead of the hideous Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper. This stuff gives a perfect fit since it's cut to fit. The expandable thing doesn't fit the sizes listed (no way it will work on a 90 inch table) and it looks like a pair of hand-me-down training pants from the 1970s."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this for the breakfast nook around my marbel countertop.  Since I don't have kids yet (we are adopting) I can't really comment about the durability.  However, they seemed to stay on tight when I applied the tape to the top and bottom on the inside of the foam.  If not I will do what some of the other posters suggested.It wasn't difficult to cut the foam to length.  I just started with one corner edge, measured the long foam piece, and then cut the foam with scissors (just alittle bit longer then what I though I needed.  It cut slightly jagged, but since I cut on the long side adjusting it wasn't a problem.  The finish product doesn't look funny or leave any gaps at all."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this table edge and corner guard to edge a window in my son's playroom. The window was level with the daybed he often played on, and I had visions of him cracking his head. I lined the edges of the windowsill. This works well. My son is a pretty good listener, and I kept telling him not to touch or pull the foam off, it was there for a reason, and it is still there two months later. It will come off very easily if pulled, just a forewarning. But I like this product and would use it again."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought a Safety First Foam Edge Bumper from Wal-Mart for the SAME price as this that was only about 5ft and didn't have corners, and it was already cut into strips. That was a HUGE mistake. Comparing this set to the one I bought, it wins in every category. It contains more than twice as much foam - PLUS corners, you can cut it to whatever size you need, it bends around curves, and It's MUCH softer than the Safety First bumper!I love it, and it's perfect. It STICKS! It's 3m brand double-sided tape and it didn't budge! I suspect people who said it doesn't stick did not clean/dry the surface properly, touched the tape too much, or maybe had a textured surface. I couldn't pull mine off, so I know my 9 month old can't."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "You know when you're child free and buy great furniture? You can't fathom the day when you'll have to apply foam to your beautiful wood table so your child doesn't go head first into the sharp corner?  Those days are now a distant memory and you bite the bullet and apply a foam guard.  Then you go to take it off because your child has spilled parmesan cheese and... what...the? The wood came off.  The WOOD came off.  I expected to have to use some Goo-Be-Gone to get off the adhesive but this actually destroyed the table.  Not like a dent that could be sanded.  I piece of wood literally splintered off.  So, while this product will protect your kid's noggin, don't put it on a piece of furniture you like."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable \"chucks\" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am so pleased that the Contoured Changing Table Pad has so many choices in color for its cover! I purchased the lilac, and a white cover and they both go well with my nursery decor. I only wish I got more that two!These terrycloth covers are thick, absorbant and easy on my newborn's skin. The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a little when you wash them. So, when you go to put them back on the pad the fit is a bit tight, but I find they pull out pretty quickly to thier normal size. When they do finally get to small to fit the pad I will go out and buy some more! I mean it's terrycloth, what do ya expect? Besides, the darn things get all kinds of yuck on them all day. They are going to take a beating being washed all the time as it is. They are totally worth the money to replace! I would buy them again!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great booster and is effective for it's job--but there are a few things that could make it an even better seat.  I can't use this booster in my home because it is made out of a rubber substance that my kids LOVE to pull apart!! My young toddler likes to bite and take chunks out of the booster seat.  If you have an aggressive chewer in the house, you may want to think about this--this material is highly attractive to chewers!  Also, the seat does not come equipped with straps.  I had to switch to another booster with straps due to some safety issues associated with this also."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is the best booster seat. It \"grips\" easily to chairs and does not slide. We use it in our captains chairs and our son is great in it! It is the most durable seat too. My nephew has had one for two years or more now and it is still in EXCELLENT condition. It is soft and comfy. It may seem pricey for a booster but it is definitely worth it. It travels easy and wipes clean in a heartbeat. Grandma even bought one to keep at her house for all the kids! Definitely a must have!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We love this booster. My 3 year is still using it and I think he started using it around 18 months or so. We have solid oak chairs and didn't have the problem of other reviewers. It sits in the same chair almost all the time and there's no residue. Maybe it has more to do with the chair finishing. Your chair does need to be made of something to \"grip\" this chair, such as a wooden chair. I tried to take it to my dad's house and he has cooshy leather chairs, and it didn't work. It cleans extremely easily, holds him securely, and works better than I could have expected."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I considered this when it was full price, 50 bucks.  When I saw it for 25, I just had to get it.  I took it back the next day because the latches that keep the buttons away from Baby broke and the buttons wouldn't work.This second try has been better.  I found it for 12.50 and decided that it would make a gift for someone else if it didn't work for me (man, I can be cruel :)  This time, it seems to work pretty well.  All the buttons work.I did have a little trouble with the light because when the light is on, the button is pressed in.  I have fingernails, so the button can be a bit tricky until you get the hang of it.I am glad I decided to try this product again, but I wouldn't have paid the 50 bucks for it.  If you can't find it on sale, get a regular CD player: they plug in and are cheaper."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This item is not top quality.  I don't have too many of this company's other products, so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will.  First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached, the batteries only lasted through two cd's, the volume doesn't get very high, and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib.  Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same.  You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I thought this would be a great idea. So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them. We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit. I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back. When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped. We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've tried several different potty seats and this is the best by far:1)  Fairly easy to clean, integrated design.  Love that it wipes clean if it gets messy2)  Built in pee guard for boys...  We had another seat with a snap on attachment, and of course it got lost while our daughter was using it.3)  very sturdy and stable on toilet.  This seat positively sits on the toilet, and my son is comfortable on it for even long periods of timeWe tried the soft plastic ones, and ironically he complained a lot more about those being uncomfortable than this one.  Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "After some little potty chair fails, I decided to try out a seat that fits on the big toilet. This one came up first as it has the most reviews, and it does for a reason. This seat works, period. I do have a girl though so I cant vouch if it works for the little guys.It has a device underneath that tightens it onto the big toilet seat. My toilet seat is the flat plastic kind so it went on with little problem. I have to finagle it a little, but it fits and is very secure so thats a win in my book.SIDE NOTE: Grandma owns the Fischer Price froggy potty which works perfectly, so if you are also thinking about getting a little chair, I highly recommend it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I definitely, wholeheartedly recommend the Baby Bjorn toilet seat reducer.This seat is contoured in a way that makes it comfortable to sit on and boy's pee goes into the toilet.There is a kind-of dial thing at the back that you turn to make the seat fit snugly and securely onto your toilet so it does not shift when your little one is on it.The handle at the back means you can hang it on a little hook if you wanted to stick one of those removable 3M hooks to your wall.I also give bonus points for the colour- white without a licensed TV character in sight :-)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've tried a few different brands of potty seats, and this is by far our favorite. It stays in place when kids climb on and off instead of slipping or tipping like some other seats. Unfortunately we changed our toilet seat/lid combo to one of those slow close plastic ones that has the removable hinges for easy cleaning, and the Baby Bjorn training seat doesn't fit it. Also, after about three years (and a couple of kids) the black rubber handle on the back started to break, but I consider that minor wear and tear. Overall, I'd recommend this seat above others on the market. It safe and looks nice."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not. It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat. The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling. we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old, and we've reduced the number of diapers significantly, with very rare #2 diapers, woohoo!!! of course i had to hold the baby, but at 11 months, holding is discouraged. there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip, but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets, though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly. (but then if your kid isn't too young, you probably won't need a trainer for a small toilet.) i even take this to other people's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training, and this product enabled me to accomplish that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I just got done potty training my boy/girl twins using the small potty chairs that sit on the floor but we are planning a vacation in a few weeks and they were terrified of using the big potty but we really had to get them using one.  I bought a cheap-o potty seat and it slid around all over the place and they were scared to use it so we went back and paid twice as much and got the Bjorn and so glad we did.  We have a TOTO brand toilet and the seat is very deep and contoured so the lock on the Bjorn didn't work at all on our toilet seat, but because it also has a grippy bottom and is quite large, it fits great anyway.  My toddlers were fine using it and began using the big potty the same day we bought it.  Definately worth the extra money, great design!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter was scared of falling in the toilet when she first started potty training.  She was so scared that she would wait until the very last second to go and she would have accidents because of it.  With this training seat she fit perfectly and her fear was over.  We ended up purchasing 3 of these because they worked so well.I am only giving it four starts though because we did find that she would hurt her booty and &#34;parts&#34; some times when she would try to slide up on it.  I understand why the bump in the front is there (to stop kids from peeing out the front of it) but if it could be made with a softer material (at least on the front) it might make it easier and less painful for kids to get on and off of."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have a very large (and very precocious) 18 month boy who is doing GREAT with this! I just came back to order another one for upstairs after carrying one back and forth for 1.5 weeks. Super portable (but easier to have one on each floor!), I've already followed another reviewer's advice to pop it in a tote bag for when we're out and about- that way, he's not afraid of using the sometimes huge potties in stores! I can't compare this to any other seats (well, we also got an actual potty chair just in case, but he's not interested), but this has worked great so far. Very comfy, and no spraying or damaged boy parts- spray guard works great."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When we were potty training our daughter, my friend told me that the toilet trainer that goes on toilet might be better to use over the one that sits on the ground because if they get too used to the one on the ground, they may be scared to go on the toilet since it's higher up.  So we bought this one and even if they are still too small, you don't have to worry about them falling into the toilet because of the way it's made.  My son is 11 months and he can sit on the toilet on this and we don't worry about him falling in.  He may try to get off but we just sit there too and bring toys or things for him to do while he sits there and then he doesn't try to climb off."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Haven't had the opportunity to need this yet as we are still utilizing the baby potty seated on the floor as our guy is too little to get on the regular potty yet.  However, wanted to get everything together and ready when we will need it.  This seat is very well made and really like that it is all one piece so there is no need to worry about bacteria collecting around a \"snap on\" deflector (for boys).  Purchased 2 of these, one for myself at my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law at theirs, as they are in the process of potty training our grandson.  It was easy to adjust to fit our regular seats, and I now have it on a hook next to the regular potty when the time comes that we are ready to use it.  I also purchased the stool and potty book...and am ready whenever my kiddies are.  Highly recommend this seat as it very well made."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My son is 3 years old and I potty trained him in 1 day. I purchased this toilet seat along with a potty book for boys (and no potty). He learned to go on this by itself, I was amazed at how fast he learned. All I had to do was get rid of the diapers and buy him big boy underwear to start the potty journey. It took a day of \"accidents\", but it was well worth it. This toilet seat is versatile and you can take it along anywhere you go! I highly recommend it -- no need for a potty either :)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have a standard size and shape toilet seat. Yet, this potty seat fits the seat in an awkward manner, causing pee to leak both on top and under the front of the toilet seat. Granted, I have little boys, so maybe this isn't so much of a problem with girls.We had MUCH better luck with the Mommy's Helper Cushie Tushie potty seat (the one with the ducks on it), which is, incidentally, much cheaper and easier to clean. The same unfortunate pee situation never happens with that seat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me.  My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it.  The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his \"equipment\" being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "my son loves it!i bought 4 different brands for him to try out and this is the best one!perfect shape, perfect comfort, perfect size for a 4 yr old. (potty trained now)sometimes, he sits on this for a long time....so i know it's very comfortable....LOLthe handle helps germophobic mommies. and it easy to wash too.the pee cover should be higher though as he has to hold down his thing so as not to pee all over the toilet floor.even with that, it is still a 5 star rating!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this potty after reading the reviews and trying to decide on the little or big potty.  I didn't think the small one would be a problem, since  my 18-month old son is on the small side.  However, after receiving it, I would only recommend this potty to those who are doing EC or for travel. My son seems to like it, but he looks huge on it and it will not last for long.  It also slides all over the tile floor like someone mentioned.  I really wish I would have bought the Bjorn big potty."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This potty is great. As the previous reviewer mentioned, it's one piece so nowhere for the pee to go except inside. I think the only fault is that it's incredibly low to the ground, so although that is great for new learners, once they master the potty training and you just need an extra around the house, it doesn't encourage them to go because it's too short. If you can spend a bit more, the newer model with the inside that comes out ($24.95) is much better in my opinion. HIgher for sure, and actually easier to dump since it has an insert. Make sure never to use bleach in these, though, I ruined the bottom of one of these by letting it sit in a 50% bleach solution, it ate away the smooth bottom."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We take this little potty with us everywhere.  I actually purchased online from Amazon specifically to find the one piece BabyBjorn Little Potty (BBLP) after my friends raved about it.It now lives permanently in the back of my car, so that my toddler can have easy access to a potty when we're on the go.  I've also taken this on planes and trips in our carry-on, so that we would have access to a potty ...even if there was not a bathroom available.  With little ones it is so hard for them to wait, and this helps keep them potty-independent.Also, if you do infant pottying or elimination communication, this is one of the &#34;must-have&#34; pottys.  The seat is a little on the smaller side compared to the standard little pottys you'll find at Toys R Us or wherever ...which makes it ideal for little ones (I am talking 1 year or younger)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got two of these after starting EC with my 9 month old.  The potty is a perfect size for a young child/baby who is beginning to use the potty.  My son can't get on it by himself, but can get off...his feet touch the floor when he is seated and he is low enough to reach for toys.  The one piece design is great for cleaning.  Other reviews said that they wished Bjorn would make a clear potty like this which is why I got white (next best thing for seeing when he's done).  If you are considering trying EC...don't hesitate you will be shocked how readily young children will indicate they need to potty and will use the potty consistently.  Great quality product for price!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a no frills, easy to clean, comfortable potty...just as a potty is supposed to be. I wanted something that would be comfortable for her little bumbum but nothing that would distract her from the job at hand. The price was definitely a plus as well. She is 2 1/2 years old, at 29 lbs and 34 inches and is on her way to becoming fully potty trained. Cleaning is pretty easy, I wipe with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes 4-Pack: 1 Fresh Scent, 2 Lemon Fresh, 1 Orange (78 Wipes Per Canister - 312 Wet Wipes Total), wash with hot water and spray withClorox Anywhere Daily Sanitizing Spray, 22-Fluid Ounce Bottles (Case of 9)and let dry or wipe dry."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I own two of these potties.  We're practicing elimination communication and these potties are the perfect size for infants!  I love that there aren't any extra bells and whistles to get in the way of easy clean up.We have one in blue and one in yellow.  My only complaint is that the yellow one came with huge black scuff marks and scratches all over it.  Even with extensive scrubbing, I can't get all the black off.  Obviously, this doesn't affect useability, but I feel robbed paying full-price for something that looks like it's been thrown under a bus.  I'm sure Amazon would have accepted it as a return, but what new parent has the time for that?  Big disappointment!  Especially since the yellow color was sooooo cute!  Way cuter than the blue - which, in comparison, seems a bit dull."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "So we have been using this potty seat for several months now trying to get our daughter used to going on the potty.  I bought this one because it had great reviews and was simple and easy to clean.  But every time we put her on it, after only a few minutes she starts complaining that her feet hurt.  What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep.  Then she doesn't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared.  She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her.  Also, every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it.  It also leaves her with a red ring around her butt.  I am going to look for a cushioned potty chair next and hopefully we have more success."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I understand that boys need a splash guard, but there's little chance that this bright-pink potty will be purchased for a boy.  And at least our little girl finds the splash guard uncomfortable, because she has to straddle it.  She has difficulty sitting down with her legs apart and often pulls the bucket out and turns it around to sit more comfortably.  I wish that baby bjorn made an insert for girls, but they don't.  Other than that (or if your girl doesn't mind this issue), it's a great potty.  It's the right size, the right distance off the ground for a two-year-old, and the back is high enough to be supportive."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great potty.  The biggest issue to me was cleaning.  This chair has no seems or corners to trap things.  The inner liner lifts off and is easy to wipe clean with a disinfectant cloth.  The boy shield is not too high and is rounded nicely so they won't hurt themselves while getting on.  The base is very solid and sturdy and doesn't move at all.  It also looks comfortable with the arm rests.  My son isn't potty trained yet but we purchased it so he could get used to sitting in it.  He seems very happy and will even sit in it to read a book.  Does what it should and doesn't distract from what they are supposed to be doing with alot of toys and noise."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This potty is just great.  My baby has been using this since she was 9.5 months old.  I love the fact that it has a chair-back so she doesn't need me to physically support her when she's on it.  All I have to do is watch her nearby.  It's really well made and very sturdy.  Also, the basin is big enough that it holds everything without spills and mess.  She doesn't mind sitting on it for 10 monutes in the mornings to do her thing...and she does pretty much without fail.  We haven't had to change a poop diaper for weeks now.  One of the most useful items I bought for the baby!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We owned our last blue babybjorn potty for over 10 years. It survived 4 children.  Unfortunately, it was accidentally cleaned with a substance that ruined the coating.We decided to go with a bjorn again and we are please with this one.  It is a large potty seat so this will fit a large child.  The white part removes easily so that it can be given a quick rinse.A child can lean back and not fall off the potty. The seat is big enough so a child can sit easily without hurting themselves.Overall, I am please with the purchase."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We were using a Bjorn Little Potty (which they don't make anymore) for a long time. But as my son grew, he kept overshooting and it was becoming a problem. At Grandma and Grandpa's house they had the Bjorn Smart Potty, which seemed to work better for him. I figured the Bjorn potties have been working well for us, lets try the top of the line Potty Chair!And its working great, the bowl rinses easily. Sometimes a little pee dribbles over the side, but its easy to rinse the whole chair in the tub. I keep it on a little rug to catch the dribbles and just throw that in the wash as needed. Any potty (with boys using it) is going to have occasional dribbles.And my son was pretty excited when it arrived!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My little two year old daughter is...well...LITTLE.  I bought this potty based on the excellent reviews here and for the most part, it delivered.1. It was relatively inexpensive.2. No bells and whistles to distract.3. Easy to clean.But, being that my kiddo is a shrimp AND a girl, the molded splash guard thing kept poking her in a highly uncomfortable way when she'd try to sit on this thing and it got to the point where when she'd see this potty she'd scream.  As a test, we got the pink girly version of the Summer 3 stage potty trainer and the screaming stopped.I'd recommend taking a look at this thing at a local store before buying.  It's a pretty good product, it just didn't work for us."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can't say enough good about this potty chair.  It's inexpensive (but very well made), SUPER easy to clean, has a very comfortable splash guard for boys and is comfortable (I'm assuming).  I originally bought the Safety 1st Potty Chair/stool.  Don't like it at all.  Tough to clean (lots of spaces for urine to get) and I don't think it's very comfortable as my son refused to sit on it.  Within 20 seconds of sitting on the Baby Bjorn he peed.  Refused for weeks to do that with the Safety 1st.  Great product.  Can't say enough good about it.From a parent's stand point, it's the best b/c it's soooo easy to clean.  I'm not clean freak, but this is a huge benefit with anything in the bathroom.Kudos to Baby Bjorn for a simple product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles.  There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed.  $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up.  In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase.  The simple design is easy to clean.  My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over.  The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits.  Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds.  My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes.  So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this potty chair after looking at several other brands/styles because of the high back and arm support. It has a great \"wrap-around\" design that is perfect for my 4-month-old who is just getting familiar with the potty. For those working on infant potty training, I highly recommend this chair. My little one has no problem sitting up in this chair by herself (of course I'm holding onto her for security). She has already made many, many poops and pees in the Baby Bjorn Potty Chair! It's also very easy to clean. Just dump out contents, rinse, and wipe with a disposable disinfecting wipe. Definitely easier than changing a diaper!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We bought this because my youngest daughter won't train on a potty seat on the toilet, so we thought this might help her transition from diapers.  It's just plastic.  I had hoped there'd be a way to put a plastic liner in the hole part so we could just take the liner off instead of having to clean the plastic bowl, but unless we want her to sit on the liner, that's not an option.  Oh well, it's a big overpriced piece of plastic."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to \"keep it all in\" if you know what I mean! =) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore! We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all. This one is truly THE BEST. Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up. It's also a really good size \"bowl\", some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in. AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We used this potty chair for both of our daughters, who potty trained at about 2.5 years old.  Its simple design is absolutely ideal for use and cleaning.  It's comfortable for toddlers to sit in, as well as easy for them to lift out the bowl and empty into the toilet themselves.  The splash guard molded as part of the bowl is excellent, providing protection as well as not being an impediment to the child sitting down.  (I can't speak for how much protection it offers for little boys, however.)  The smooth plastic without any real corners or edges makes cleaning effortless.  Plus, the rubber bottom really does keep the seat from slipping across the floor.  Plus, as an added bonus, it resembles the potty seat depicted in the \"Once Upon A Potty\" video, so the kids can easily connect the concept to real life.  I highly recommend it, and can't imagine using any other seat!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38\" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have found that Baby Bjorn potty products are the best on the market and doesn't break the pocket book! It's oblong vs round so urine and poop stays in the pot. The built in splash guard is great! It's easy to clean and light weight, but built tough. Variety of colors. My triplets are all different shapes and sizes. We have a very large boy and has plenty of room for him. Our other son is a bit small for his age and because the pot is oval there is no leg stretching and no \"falling in\". Our daughter is long and very thin. She has no problems what so ever on this! Her tiny behind doesn't fall in or slip or anything. The splash guard never gets in her way! It's just the best! Other moms who see this ask where they can get one! Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Got this for my daughter (shes 2).  I like it real well.  She is a smaller child and it fits pretty good.  She can sit on it and on feel like she's going to fall in.  I would recommend this to others.  I also got the step stool. She likes to run over to the sink and wash her hands when she's done....The step is nice too.BabyBjorn Safe Step - White(I got the pink one to match her seat)It stays put and is sturdy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This potty works very well for us.  My son likes that it is his size (we also have a potty seat for the toilet which he isn't so into).  It is light enough that he can move it himself, but the rubber grip on the bottom keeps it from slipping when he sits.  I can see how other children may have problems bumping themselves on the splash guard, which you can't remove, but this hasn't been a problem for him.  Also, we have had no problems whatsoever with pee going everywhere as other reviewers have.Pros:Easy to cleanGrips to the floorSturdyGood colorsRounded edgesCons:Can't remove the splash guardInside bowl can be removed easily by the child"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have this potty in green.  I was lucky enough to find it on clearance at a local store by me for $12!!  If I would have known how much I would love this potty, I would have spent the money on it two years prior when we were potty training our first child.  I love the simple design of this potty and that it only has two parts.  It makes cleaning much easier.  No one enjoys cleaning out a potty, but it's so much easier when you only have two pieces to clean.  Our other potty had several pieces with it and a lot of cracks and crevices.  I just wipe this potty up with a lysol or clorax wipe and I'm done!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "fit as expected,,my baby love it .This potty chair doesn't come with all the whistles and bells like other potties. But is the best. When i was shopping for a potty, i read the reviews and then went to the store to &#34;explore&#34; for myself. i wasn't convinced of any other potty. why? 'cause all the others either didn't sit sturdily on the floor (and this is w/o a child sitting on it)or were difficult to clean. This potty is simple and sturdy, gets the job done, comfy (my picky daughter never complained, she likes the teddy bear logo on it), and so easy to clean. Never had a spill too. Besides, potty training should be as simple and natural as possible, so choose a simple potty. i have 2 of this item (1 downstairs and 1 upstairs, now thinking of using 1 at home and 1 for the car).there's plenty of space to stick stickers as a reward everytime she goes potty too"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Everything I read said to keep the potty as basic as possible.You can't get more basic than this potty and the winning factor for me is that it is so easy to clean.There aren't any cracks or crevices you need to worry about.I bought it long before I knew my child was ready to use it and placed it in the bathroom as someplace she can hang out while Mommy was in the potty.  If your child was like mine, she wanted to follow you everywhere, even the bathroom.She started sitting on her potty to emulate me.After a bit, she asked to take her pants off and that's how we started potty learning.Since the basin is one wrap around tub, I just life it off to clean and put it back.  No need to snap things or worry about cleaning crevices.I also like that it is the right size.  The back helped stabilize her when she was really small and now as an older toddler, it still fits her just fine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Easy to clean.The &#34;lip&#34; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty, but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the &#34;bowl&#34; off to pour the contents in the toilet.  Even my 2 (almost 3) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides. Makes it comfortable for the child, especially when we initially began using the potty."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've had several potty chairs and I'd say I like this one best. It has a high back and armrests, making it comfortable for my daughter to sit. There aren't a whole lot of cracks and crevices, which makes it easy to clean. The chair is sturdy and doesn't tip over. It is larger than some of the other chairs, which were a little too small as my daughter grew. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this chair first._________________UPDATE:  This chair eventually went to my niece and nephew.  It had been a good potty chair and I was happy to share my good find with my sister-in-law.  She agreed it is a good chair."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My son and I love this potty. I never had a hard time training him to use it. In fact, I only told him once what to do, and he was using it since then. He seems to be very comfortable with it that he seems to actually enjoy sitting on it while making poo and playing his toy ramp & cars at the same time. He also likes using it without doing something else so I know its not about the toy. He loves that he can be independent & his potty makes him feel that. My son is 2 years old and weighs 32 lbs. Cleaning is also very easy, even without a liner. This happens when my son would use the potty on his own without a liner. I only have good words to say about this potty. I have no complaints at all."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I just finished potty training my oldest child and really loved this potty chair.  When we first started potty training, it was a little too big for her- so if you have a small child, it might be hard for him/her to easily get on and off of it alone.  By the time she was 2.5, she had no issues getting on and off.  The splash guard is great and makes it easy to lift out while still keeping your hands clean.  The potty part is also deep enough to hold anything in it if your child decides to bring you the potty to show you their work :)Great little potty!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this potty seat. There is no foam seat for the pee to seep into. Just two simple pieces that are so easy to clean. This was the best thing I could have bought for all of our potty training kids. The lip in front looked too high at first. But actually it is perfect. Perfect for girls potty training and for little boys. I would recommend this seat to anyone who has a little one potty training. I just might keep this seat forever....I will have visiting grandchildren someday. :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We actually started with the potty inserts that go right on top of the regular toilet (built in type, portable type, and a cushioned type).  My son was refusing to use that to potty train, and we decided to try this one instead.  It took awhile, but now he's using this exclusively.He likes it because it is just his size, doesn't require help from us, and can be put right in front of the tv (we'll have to change this last one soon!).  He will even wait to pee when we are out so he can use his &#34;small potty&#34; at home instead of public toilets.We like it because he uses it, it is easy to clean with the white part coming right out of the chair, and the splash guard is great for the boys.  There's a smaller version of this chair without the back that we take with us when we are out or on vacation too."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a very nice potty chair.  It is a sleek, simple design, easy to clean, no annoying sounds or other bells/whistles.  I ordered it to get my child used to sitting on the potty (not starting training yet).  I have a small (18 pound) 1 year old and this seat was just a little bit too tall.  I ended up ordering the Baby Bjorn Smart Potty, which is a very similar design without the high back/sides, and it seems to be a much better size for my needs.  It appears that the bowls are interchangeable. I posted side-by-side photo of both of the potties for comparison purposes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I just received my son's potty chair two days ago and he absolutely loves it.  He sat it in it like a chair for an entire day the first day but when he took a pee in the potty chair, it went all over the floor instead of into the bowl.  The downfall of this chair is that, the front piece that's suppose to block the pee from spilling out, is not high enough.  My son is a 2 year old and he's rather tall for his age but height has nothing to do with the front piece.  It's just not made high enough to block the pee from spilling out.  However, it is easy to clean because the bowl just pulls out easily."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a child sized toilet.  It is attractive looking.  We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house.  Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it.  I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse.  My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that.  I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet.  We are big fans of this."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We love that this seat makes it comfortable for our little boy compared with the wider conversion style potty chairs (the ones that turn into step stools) because the back is higher and it has arm rests.  Another great perk is that it takes up significantly less space.  Makes it easier to keep it conveniently located for your toddler.  Also, despite its 'lack' of bell and whistles it is easy to clean and safe.  The no skid rubber bottom is an excellent feature!  Highly recommend this potty chair!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Having selected this chair based on the reviews here I felt I should give my own. This was for my first child, now 3 and we bought this over a year ago. He is fully potty trained now and still uses this seat and I think he'll be using it for a while to come. It cleans and disinfects very easily and still looks brand new. He's very comfortable in it and its a very very good fit. It was a year ago, and it still is. For the novice parent of boys, it doesn't matter how high they make the splash guard, boys need to point it down. That took some learning on my part. We have the Bjorn that fits over the potty too, but we've hardly used it. He and we love this one way too much and its so much easier for him to use the potty on his own."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Our son just turned two and we have begun introducing him to his own potty.  This chair is great.Pros:1- Sturdy.  He leans forward to get a wayward car or his stuffed teddy and it does not tip forward with him2- Catches all of the day's product, nothing has escaped yet- the guard is tall enough.3- Easy to take the pot out and dump into the toilet but because he is sitting on it, no chance for him to pull it out and dump while he is sitting.4- Easy to clean (the most important?)Con:1- Once he has stuck to the pot and when he stood up quickly, it stuck to him and dumped.  A minor problem in the grand scheme of things and it has not happened since.We bought one for grandma's house and would recommend highly"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased these in the hopes they would work for our newborn.  Unfortunately, I haven't even given birth yet and I already know they're not going to hold up to the demands of a newborn wetting even once in them.The pros: inexpensive.The cons: These diapers are horribly rough, even after a washing.  The fabric is fraying and even triple folded, these things do not hold liquid.  Since I'd already washed them I figured I could at least use them for dish towels, but they merely move the water around on whatever surface you're trying to dry, they don't absorb.Save your money and skip these...and buy a higher quality cloth diaper."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Love these! Absorbent, soft, inexpensive, held up well after many MANY washes, no stains, ect.  My only complaint is that they shrink quite a bit.My daughter has always hated wearing disposable diapers.  When she was a newborn, she'd holler whenever we tried to put one on her.  As she got older, she'd arch her back, scream, and try to get away as we were putting the diaper on her.  So when she was a newborn, I used these flat folds wrapped oragami style (no plastic cover, although you could use one) to give her a break from her disposable diaper.  We've actually made the switch to cloth diapering full time.  Now I use these as a cloth insert for the gdiaper (fold in fourths, then half) and Thirsties (fold in thirds, then half).  You could also easily use these to stuff pocket diapers."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I just want to start of saying that I had purchased these with the intent of cloth diapering my baby.  I had used Gerber flatfolds and prefolds on my first two children back in 2000 and 2002.  They were amazingly awesome back in the day, so I'm wondering what on earth happened.These are very thin . . . I mean see through thin.  I couldn't even use them as a changing, shoulder or lap pad in a pinch. Any baby \"mishap\" would immediately seep through.  Not only that, they feel very rough - not something you'd want to rub on a newborn baby's skin to clean spit-up or drool.I feel bad for giving such a poor review because I'm normally a huge fan of Gerber products.  I just think that these are pointless and a waste of money.  You can find better flatfolds for nearly the same price as these.  As far as burp cloths, the Gerber prefold diapers work awesome for those."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are the only bottles I use and they work well.  They are very durable & dishwasher safe. I have a medela pump also. My daughter is breastfed and feeds from these well, except for with the slow flow nipples - I recommend a fast flow nipple unless you want to take over a half hour to feed your baby while he/she struggles to get the milk out.  I should mention that she is not picky (becasue some babies are)about what type/brand of nipple she uses as long as the flow is not too slow."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I use the pump-in-style advanced breastpump, and I really like that these bottles screw right into the pump assembly.  I like having many bottles on hand so that I don't need to wash them every day.  I don't freeze my milk in these (I use Gerber bags), but they're great for temporary storage until pouring into the feeding bottles.  I use Avent bottles as my baby seems to like the shape and flow of the newborn nipples (these nipples seem too fast-flowing)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "First, these really do protect bedding against leaks and spills. Get the bed sized ones as an under layer (which adds cushioning from the plasticky mattresses that are made today), layer on the pretty sheets, then use a smaller pad under the diaper area. This protects the sheets but the very bottom pad protects your mattress in case a true accident occurs. I must admit that after washing, these pads did pill but this did not deteriorate their effectiveness. I'd go to Target for the softer, thinner, prettier, and just as effective smaller size. It's the difference between wearing a hospital pad versus a brand name pad. Both work just as well but one is more confortable on the go."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i got these to put on my bed for my son's morning massage-cuz by now it's no secret what little boys do once those nappies come off! the first time i used it i seriously used the expression \"let's see how good these really are\"...only to be terribly disappointed: upon turning him over (yes he did let out a dose)i found i had really let my child lay in a puddle!! this o so absorbent pad really did nothing but allow for a greater area of redistribution. i even ventured to put my hand into it to see how much was absorbed n literally had stuff dripping from my fingers!!this was a waste of my money. i am back to using a regular sheet folded over."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love these pads! After reviewing many reviewers I decide to buy one and try it. It is so soft and absorbent! Mine has not pilled and has gone through many washings. I ended using it in my diaper bag since the changing places in public restrooms don't always appear clean. It fits so much better in my diaper bag than a bulky changing pad and my daughter likes better since not cold. I bought more of these and left one in her cosleeper for leaks and as a changing pad at night so no trips to nursery. Another was placed downstairs with wipes and diapers in a basket for quick changes on the couch and everyone loved using them.Great price and you will get your moneys worth out of them. They go anywhere and we left one at grandmas and one in the car for changing on the seat when not convenient to change elsewhere. Will use for next bundle of joy!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have 2 packs in different sizes. On the package it's advertized as a burp cloth. I've used it over a pillow on my lap, but it's too stiff to use over your shoulder. It's good at trapping moisture and keeping the surface beneath from getting wet or damp. It stayed strong after several washes. I used to lay my daughter on it to protect her mattress or sheets, but I find that it doesn\"t breathe well enough and when she had baby acne it made the break-outs much worse."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought two of these and I just love them.  I use both of them at the same time--one for his head, the other for his butt. They do the trick of catching spit-up, vomit, and leaking diaper problems.  These pads save me a lot of time beacuse I don't have to worry about doing the sheets all the time. They're getting a little fuzzy now that they've been through the wash a few times, but for $7, I think these pads are a great buy!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My child at a year old can sip out of them but a lot does come out.  He is getting better now after a few months of having them.  He throws this on our hard floors and nothing comes out!  It's a great cup that way, totally spillproof!  Playtex does make insulated ones which in my opinion are a lot better for two reasons.The first reason is that my childs hands do not get cold while sipping from cup and second the drink stays a lot colder a lot longer.  The valves are easy to put in and take out, my child only has water and milk still so I am not sure how well they will work for juice."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are fantastic for freezing/storing/reheating breast milk.  Unlike some of the reviews I read, I have experienced no leaking thusfar.  I use a Medela pump and transfer my milk into these containers because they have proven to be so wonderful (and they are acrylic, so reheating is much easier).  My only complaint is that they are slightly too small.  I usually pump more than 4 but less than 8 oz. and so I am forced to either use two containers or sacrifice my milk (which is too precious!).  However, I can deal with the smaller size because overall it is such a great product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had previously purchased another tub because it was a few dollars cheaper but soon regretted it once received. The tub had two pouches to but the soap and shampoo. But the one thing i needed was a drain. The dirty water built up and the only way to get it out is to tilt it up so it can pour out. Such a hassle while washing a 9month old. Not with this one though. I can fill the tub up for him to play and splash and allow it to drain out when its time to wash. Great, so my son don't soak in dirty water which he does pee in."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This inflatable tub was perfect! A good size, no frills, and a suction cup that worked well for mounting it to the shower wall when we were finished using it. It worked great, until we started noticing slow leaks. We'd super glue one, only to find another a few weeks later. Time to buy a new tub.*Update - all the other tubs have the same negative reviews about splitting seams over time. Since this tub worked so well for us until it split and we love the suction cup, we just bought another one. Ah well."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was worried about this purchase reading all the reviews.  So far so good.  My 9 month old son loves the water we use this in the tub for bath time where he splashes and has fun. I bought the Safety 1st Splash Infant Bath Cushion, Blue to go in it.  I use that sometimes as I don't find the bottom of the tub that slippery, my son stands up in it and doesn't slip.But I was worried about safety so I purchased the cushion.We also use it for a swimming pool, sort of.  We have had some very hot days so I take it out side on my deck putting a old blanket underneath & he just sits in it and plays.I like it also when he has diaper rash as I can put the baking soda in the water to help dry it up and the height of the tub allows me to get it high enough over his butt."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I couldn't find anywhere--not on amazon nor on the product or its packaging--what this tub is made of, but I suspect it might be made of PVC. It has a strong new-shower-curtain/new-pool-toy smell when you first open it, and I let it air out for a few days before using it. The smell is gone now, but I would have loved it if this tub were made of a less smelly (and probably more eco-friendly) material.Also, the tub doesn't fit directly under the faucet--half the water goes in the inflatable tub, and half of it goes between the inflatable tub and the side of the bathtub. I fill a large plastic bowl with water and dump it into the tub to fill the tub.Other than these issues, the tub is ok. The size is good and it does the job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My son outgrew his infant tub so I tried to bath him in a regular tub - wasn't having it!  So I needed something fast that could act as a transition tub.  This fit the bill.  I would recommend buying a hand pump to fill it (just be very careful).  I tried to blow it myself and nearly passed out!  I used the pump from my exercise ball and it was inflated and ready to go in minutes.  Just place the plug in the hole and fill!  I am not sure why people have complained about it being slipper - my son stands up just fan when I have to wash his bottom.  He loves it!  My only complaint is that the bottom leaves...um...rear end stains so make sure you keep it clean or at least pre-clean your babies bottom before putting them in.  I always do so I don't know how it stains but it does!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got this for our 7 month old twins who have just started sitting up alone but are still a bit wobbly.  The tub is really cute but the bottom panel on the one we got had a leak and would not stay inflated, which completely defeats the purpose of creating a soft surface for them.  We ended up putting the infant bath sponge that we used when they were newborns in the bottom and sitting them on that.  They had a great time splashing and playing.  It's a great tub if you get one that holds air."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm very satisfied with this affordable blow up tub.  The bottom part under the baby's butt blows up separately than the sides, which is nice because my 6 month old was unstable sitting on the blown up bottom at first.  She loves the ability to play in the water in here, I just have a hard time keeping her sitting in the tub, she keeps wanting to stand up and climb the bathtub walls. I think that's more an issue with my very active daughter than the tub though :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think we bought this for $8. I was in the market for a snoogie but couldn't bring myself to pay $60 for a pillow I would only use for a few months. I am 7 months along and I didn't realize that I needed to 'lift' my belly a bit. Works great. A lot more sturdy than I thought. I'm glad it's not memory foam because I need a 'lift' not to sink in. I gave it 4 stars only because I have 2-3 more months to go in my pregnancy.A great buy! A great little size that does the job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this pillow and when it arrived I was disappointed. I purchased it intending to use it to prop my torso up at night during my 2 trimester. It was much smaller than I realized and tossed it aside. A few weeks later I started using it between my knees while I slept on my side. I also used it under my growing belly so It wouldn't hang. I found myself using it behind my back during TV time and also in the car. I used it all the time. Right now, I am letting a friend borrow it for her back at work since she is in her third trimester. I would recommend this pillow to anyone so has back issues or is pregnant. The case comes off so you can clean it too."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This pillow is smaller than a standard sized bed pillow.  It is just enough to wedge under my hip & keep me off of my vena cava (now 7 months along.)  It does not solve all of my comfort issues, but it gives me peace of mind that I'm not laying flat while I sleep (which I find myself doing without it.)  It seems like it will fit perfectly in my bassinet after the baby is here to elevate her head.  And when I'm done using it for that, it will make a perfect knee-separator pillow.  I have already gotten my $10 worth & forsee using it for a long time to come."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help.  However, this didn't really help me sleep better at all, if anything it made it worse.  It was very uncomfortable.  Maybe I'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger.***UPDATE***  Now that I am 33 weeks, I use this support pillow every night.  Once my tummy got bigger, the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much.  Now I can't sleep without it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not for car seats.  However, it doesn't have to do with crash testing issues.  The technician who installed my car seat told me to never ATTACH anything to my car seat (including toys) that didn't come with the seat, and the way these headrests fit, that is considered to be attached.  The reason had to do with how your baby will fit in the seat.  It's the same reason you are not supposed to put your baby in a car seat when he or she is extremely bundled up- you end up securing the clothing more than the baby.  The technician did recommend the rolled blanket idea- the blankets will not cause harm to your baby in a crash, and they do not interfere with how the baby fits in the seat at all.I am using mine in the stroller and his swing.  It works well for these items.  I give it three stars because it is not totally useless."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This headrest is perfect.  Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this.  When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward.  Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy.  At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this.  I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible.  It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car.  For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower.  I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest.  Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat.  Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury.  The product may be a fine one, but I found an &quot;extra&quot; one to be unnecessary."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This item seems like a good idea, but after purchasing two I feel that we've fallen victim to \"new parent baby marketing\". Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it. She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved. I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?) She would just shake it around, bang it, or throw it. Also, it's a total pain to clean it. The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.Save your money on this one."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "What a great way to introduce baby to fresh fruit &amp; veggies. No choking! I admit the older style bags were hard to clean (Oxy clean and an overnight soak in hot water in a cup before a top-rack dishwasher run did get it clean, but was messy and took extra time).Now, new easy-clean/disposable bags are here! Look for them out there--our BRU had them recently. Pitch them if they're really bad, but just unscrew bag from ring, scrub or soak both and voila, put back together and re-use. Then throw them away as the bags age, tear or stain.Alex has used ours since 4 months of age and our original bags plus newer replacements are still going strong at 10 months, with repeated dishwasher-ing."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We started using this feeder when my son was just 3 months old.  He loved the flavor of melon, but we were uncomfortable with letting him bite on a piece of melon for fear he might choke.  The baby feeder was the perfect answer.You can cut up just about anything and place it in the feeder bag.  We even put lightly frozen grapes in it when my son was teething.  We used it mostly for fruit, especially melon, grapes, pears, and strawberries.  I will admit that it can be messy to use this feeder, but it was totally worth it to us to give our son a chance to learn to love fresh fruits.  Enjoy!!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams. I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think this is a great idea. I only used it a couple times for foods. At that time she was having trouble mastering how to hold the handle and soon after that she was able to pick up foods on her own and was pretty good at chewing. I LOVE this product for when she is teething. I put a couple ice cubes in it and wet it under the faucet so it doesn't stick to her lips. She gets upset when the ice is gone. My daughter is 11 months and has been teething almost none stop since 3 months...Currently she is cutting her first molars and this helps for her to suck on it and get the cold water back farther than a teething ring would."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion.  I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me.  Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them.  These were just about the worst!!  My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding.  I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped.  I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.  I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them.  If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up.  Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean.  Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often.  What a waste!!  The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective.  You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent.  In additon to this, the cost is ridiculous.  The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof.  They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart. These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design. Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this sheet because I believed everything should be &quot;form fitting&quot; if my son was to be in it - to prevent possible suffocation, choking....This sheet was so rough I could not lay my baby on it.  After washing 3-4 times with loads of fabric softener - no difference.I used it once and it's been in the closet ever since.I ended up putting a thin blanket in the packnplay and tucking it into the sides instead.  It was soft, and when my child was sleeping he didn't pull it out.If and when I use the pack and play as a playpen, I may pull the sheet out and try again.  For the basinett - don't bother."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this item (in a different color) two years ago for my son.It is NOT waterproof- but what SHEET is?!  I recommend purchasing a 27\" size BRU Especially for Baby Brand waterproof pad to go under the sheet (Just like you would buy a waterproof cover for your crib mattress!).  The sheet will hold the pad in place and fit perfectly over top both the pad and mattress.This sheet is durable and launders easily.I was so pleased with this product, I would purchase it again!  In fact, I did!  I am expecting TWINS, so I purchased another sheet in this color and also TWO of the smaller size for my two Graco Travel Lite Cribs/PNP's.Good job, Graco for coming up with yet another GREAT product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I also almost didn't buy these sheets because of the reviews on this site, but I couldn't find another brand either, so I picked up two of these in navy.The sheets are a bit on the thin side (they are the thinnest sheets we own for him), but since our son has been sleeping in the bassinet in our room since day one, they are the only sheets he's ever slept on. They are okay sheets that are holding up very well, even through numerous washings. Oh, and they aren't elasticized, but it is so tricky to get them on the bassinet, I have no worries that they will come up (we haven't used the play yard feature yet).By the way, we've been using them all through a hot Colorado summer; if this were winter I would definitly be looking for something softer and cozier."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet.  Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality??Also, keep in mind your wash loads.  I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels.  Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry.  Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been through 4 brands of disposables and also have several pairs of these. At first when I was sore and using nipple cream, I used the disposables. The yellow cream stains, so I didn't want to mess up my good pads. After I no longer needed cream, I moved on to the washable ones. I think they are so much softer and more comfortable than the disposables. I forget that I even have them on. I agree with other posters that they may not be as discreet as some of the disposables, but I don't really care. I don't wear too many tight clothes these days and if I did I could use disposables (to me the J&J and Avent disposables are the most discreet). I don't leak much anymore, so these are plenty sufficient to collect leakage. I have four pair. I generally do laundry once a week, with one load at some point mid-week. I'm able to always have some on hand."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they've worked great. They're easy to wash and dry, I just throw them in with my regular clothes. I didn't give it 5 stars because you can't wear these with thin clothes or they show. I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way, but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show. I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use. I bought two packs and might get another one so that I don't have to wash them during the week. Why buy disposables? Seems pretty wasteful to me."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was hoping to find a more eco way of dealing with leakage than using disposables. These work in terms of absorption for me (I should qualify that to mean I leak but generally during feedings or at night and not profusely, but enough to soak 50% of the surface of my bra at a time).Unfortunately, they are so thick they show through my more tailored clothes (flowy, patterned tops seem to remedy much of this problem). The stitching is rough and itchy. Once the pad is washed it's very ripply and won't sit flat (which is the biggest annoyance for me). They're great if you plan on being a slovenly hermit at home, but I wouldn't want to wear them in public."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Can't say enough good things about this stool. I used one at my lactation consultant's office and found it really helpful. It gets your body in the right position and makes nursing so much more comfortable. It's well made and easy to assemble. I am not too tall - 5'3\" with legs on the shorter side. Maybe if you have longer legs you don't need a stool, but I would recommend it to any new mom planning to breast feed. In my experience, anything to make those first few weeks easier - while you and your baby are learning to breast feed - is worth it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been having horrible back problems since the third trimester of my pregnancy. And things got worse when my son was born. I simply could not get comfortable while breastfeeding, and was having trouble maintaining good posture, so my back was getting worse and worse. I ordered this stool thinking it would help me get comfortable and sit straight. Unfortunately, it has not helped me at all.I think one main problem is that I am very short: 5'1\" and change. When I sit on my couch, my feet don't reach the stool. So it doesn't help me there. While I sit on the miniature recliner in my baby's room, my feet do reach, but the sticky pads on the feet of the stool are not sticky enough. So if I put any weight on the stool at all, it slides away from me in seconds.This is a nice product, and well made. I just wish it worked for me. :("}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This stool is a miracle worker for tired legs and backs.  I love to use it when nursing my son upstairs.  The slanted top means your feet are positioned perfectly for holding a baby.  It's very sturdy and doesn't slide around on the floor like my daughter's plastic stools do.I did not get this until baby #2, and I wish I had had it with the first one!  Believe me, there is no comparison between rocking/nursing/holding a baby with this stool, or just resting your feet on the floor.Definitely in my \"top ten\" list of must-haves for breastfeeding."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for this stool when pregnant, thinking it would be a nice position-helper while breast feeding, and it is, with one drawback: it tips easily if you put any weight on the edges (top edge or either side). So far, this hasn't been a huge problem, except for making a loud THUMP every time I do it, which sometimes startles the baby. I would just suggest that you avoid ever using it as an actual stool and never step or stand on it, and keep any little kiddos away from it too.Other than the potentially dangerous tipping thing, it is a nice wood piece and went together very easily. As stated before, I would not use it in place of a safer flat stool, but it would be absolutely great under a desk to prop up your feet while working."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have a white crib and the last set of these I bought (years ago) were discolored. These are clear, and look and fit great on our crib. You should definitely measure the width and thickness of the area you want to protect though. I know some people did not, and wrote poor reviews about it when it was clearly buyer error. Our son figured out how to remove the other ones we had, but not these. So far, our nice crib is saved, hopefully for baby #2."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I liked this product because it's a good rubbery material to chew on, but it only fit on the sides of our crib as the front bar is much wider. I had actually gotten these & put them on when my daughter was in the crib, but after being on a few months, they almost looked kind of liquidy underneath and when I went to remove them, they removed some of the wood varnish as well, so I left them on to look better. My daughter actually never did bite on the crib railings but my son does (3yrs later) and prefers chewing on the front bar best, of course. At least the side bars they fit on will not be used when it's converted to a full size bed, but there will still be those teeth marks on the bed footer. Oh well, it's kind of cute. I plan to use one of those wood color markers to cover the teeth marks if it really bothers me."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is challenging to get open and closed for the adult in the equation. There are a series of little pegs that must fit into little holes to get it to latch. But they are quite challenging to get to line up correctly and heaven forbid you need to get it back open. Now you would think that that's the point of the power strip cover, right? Except the hole that allows the cords to come out the top is so wide that my 9 month old just sticks his hand right inside and can put a finger in the socket. It does come w a couple outlet plugs for the extra slots in your power strip, I was just hoping this would work a wee bit better. If all you really need is to prevent your child from unplugging things from your power strip, than this will work for you."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have a basic single row power strip, and i couldn't shut the smaller side door or it would depress the power switch... therefore making this completely useless to me.The snap buttons are hard to open and close, so it would be good to keep little fingers out, but i just couldnt use it for my power strip.The stip i have is SIMILAR to this one,&lt;...>but not exactly the same. Mine is dark color and newer looking with spots labeled \"adapter\" so you can plug in large plugs and not lose any outlet space."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We are fortunate in the design of our computer desk.  A baby safety gate did the trick for us. Instead of installing a power strip safety cover, I purchased an inexpensive tension safety gate (ten bucks) and pushed it way back under the desk against the wall with all the cords and boxes (routers etc.) behind it.  Keeps his little hands out of everything and I still have room for my chair & feet.  Still trying to find the best solution for protection for 2 other strips in our home. Seems like nothing is perfect."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Great Idea. Doesnt work on plugs that are bulky and go sideways. But will work for most plugs even some large ones. The reason i gave it a 3 stars is because two reasons.One the wires come out the top making it hard to put them in a cord hider. Two bc they do come out of the top by daughter can still grab and chew on them. Would be better if they had the wires group together out the side. I saw a more expensive version of this that did that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is one of the worst products created for child safety. It didn't fit our standard power cord, the front section opened really easily (actually had a hard time getting it to stay closed) and once we opened the back section to plug things in, couldn't get the back section closed again. Also, the opening at the top is huge! Definitely big enough for my 9-month old to stick her fingers in, which is kind of the opposite of its purpose. I sent it back and moved around furniture to hide our power cords instead."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got this for the power strip in our livingroom by our tv.  It does a great job of hiding the strip and the plugs and I like that you can open the part of the on/off switch separate from the section where the plugs are.  But there also lies the problem with this.  The clips on the side are not easy to reattach.  So as long as you don't plan on opening and closing this a lot then it works great.... but if you need a cover over a strip that you need to access a lot, then this one will most likely frustrate you quickly!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was going to get the \"spindle\" changing table from POttery Barn Kids but found this one, at about 1/3rd of the price. This one is even better b/c of the rail that goes around the actual changing area.. i do recommend a contoured changing pad with a comfy cover. i have attached a crib mobile to this table to keep katie happy during diaper time. this changing table looks good in her room, i also bought the Jenny Lind crib. i did get the baskets from PBK to store stuff neatly on the shelves. The only complaint that i have is that the shelves are basically hard cardboard, but dont let that discourage you b/c they really are sturdy and as i mentioned i've got baskets on the shelves so you really dont notice."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it.  The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric.  The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel.  I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though.  Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad.  You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one.  I never used covers with DD and never had a problem."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These drop-ins are okay - they are not an improvement over an ordinary bottle. Yes, I can simply throw these liners away after using them, but since I still have to wash the bottle's nipple, this system does not save me any time. I use these liners in conjunction with my bottle warmer and they don't melt, which is good. I bought the Playtex Drop-In system to try to reduce the amount (frequency and quantity) that my baby spits up. However, the amount of spit-up is the same - not better, but also not worse."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have some Dr. B brand bottles. They are awesome. But when I was a first time mom, I hated washing bottles and parts. It didn't take much time, but still it took time. So I switched to Playtex Drop-Ins bottles. Yay! I rinsed tons of nipples and washed them all at once later on the day. Now I have my 2nd child. Playtex Drop-ins is the only one I use.The liners are expendable. It designed for the bottle. It's durable and doesn't have plastic smell like other generic brand I used once.Please note: If you want to use generic brand liners, you fill water to the water lines ON THE LINER instead of the marks on the bottle itself. The water level/volumn is different."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Couldn't find this in stores around my area. But I've used this before and they're great. It's convenient and it minimizes the need for a lot of bottles and best part is they're disposables. I never had problems with this drop-in liners before although I did read another review that there's another liner that can be used with the drop-in nurser bottles, just as good if not more effective, cheaper and more count. Regardless, this has my stamp of approval and I would recommend this for new parents."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I tried Avent and Dr. Browns before switching to Playtex Drop Ins.  I liked all three but Playtex drop ins are so easy!  And, the way the nipple is, for my daughter, seems to be the most natural and closest to breastfeeding.  if you feel the nip, sounds weird!, it has a texture to it that other bottles don't.  most bottles nips are pretty \"hard\" unless you go latex...which scared me because I didn't want to find out the hard way that my baby had a latex allergy!  Anyway, the silicone nip on the playtex nursers is much softer and pliable so the baby can kind of pull on it as she wants to.  It's great!  I highly recommend.  Hopefully this review is not too strange :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I measured 8 ounces in a measuring cup, then poured it in the liner, and it was a little below the 8 ounces mark on the liner. I tried it again with a different measuring cup and received the same result. You can not put the liner in the bottle first to fill it up, because the measurements on the bottle do not match up with the measurements on the liners, My husband always has a hard time filling up the liners because it is hard to hold it and add water since they expand. Also, the numbers on the liner are very hard to read."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I started the first month of motherhood washing and sterilizing bottles multiple times a day. Then I came upon these Playtex nursers with disposable liners, and now I only use a regular bottle if I have to.  Valuable time has been saved, now that I'm using these things instead!The only caution I have for others out there is to be very aware of the measurements. Because the liners can accommodate 8-10oz of fluid, don't trust the measurements on this. I noticed the difference when I poured 5oz of pre-measured milk that had been stored in a milk storage bag, and when it was in the Playtex bottle, the bottle indicated only 4oz of fluid.Aside from needing to be more conscious of the measurements, this bottle liner system has been a life changing discovery for my household."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have used disposable drop-in liners from multiple stores (Wally-World, the bullseye store, & various drugstores) and find that they all work just as fine as these Playtex ones do, but at half the price.  I like that the Playtex liners are thinner feeling, meaning the liner collapses better inside the bottle when baby is drinking...but even with the others feeling like a thicker plastic, they work as well.  Playtex, come down in price and you'll get 5 stars instead of only 4."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These liners are a great idea in theory. I only use them because my baby like the latex nipples and not many other bottle brands have latex nipples anymore. The measurements are a nightmare, I have to guess how much breastmilk I am pouring in the bottle. The only thing that helps is that I pour it in from a lansinoh storage bag and that gives me a better idea of how much I am putting in.With regards to leaks and the liner lip pulling free and falling out, I only experienced that with the 4oz liners but that was because I was overfilling them. However I am always worried about this happening so I screw the nipple on very carefully. It would be great if the nipple ring was clear so you could see if the liner is on the verge of pulling free or not."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The playtex with drop-ins system works great. Makes cleaning super easy - since you don't need to sterilize the bottle every time you use it. The liner and the nipple are the only things that come in contact with milk - the liner is disposed off after one use, and the nipple can be easily sterilized.This system works particularly well when traveling. I introduced these to my son when he was 2.5 months old and we were on a flight for 16 hours. I simply took 2 nurser bottles, lots of liners, and many nipples. Made cleaning super easy on the flight - and gave me the piece of mind that everything was sterilized. The biggest advantage was that my luggage was a lot less bulky (as opposed to traveling with 8 glass bottles).The only downside: The 1 oz, 2 oz, 3 oz etc markings on the nurser are not correct. You should use another system of measurement to figure out how much milk/water you want to pour in the nurser."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This product works directly with our Medela breastpump with the use of adapters that come with the breastpumping kit.  It is nice not to have to transfer the breast milk from one container to another.  I cannot comment on the freezing aspect since I did not make enough milk to be able to freeze.  The only downfall to the liners that we found is measuring out the quantity is not accurate if the liner isn't fully expanded.  We measure in a different container and pour into the liner.  The best part about this system is that we are sure that the container holding the milk is clean- we just don't trust a regular plastic bottle to come completely clean.  Our other bottles are the good old fashioned Evenflo glass bottles.  All in all, we recommend this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This warmer costs more than it's worth.  We have to stand there while it's &quot;warming&quot; a bottle until the light turns off and then when we check the bottle it's still cold.  Having to stand hawk eyed over a bottle warmer with a crying, hungry baby isn't fun...especially when it doesn't warm the first time around.  On the other hand, if the bottle stays in a minute too long, the milk gets so hot that we have to set it in cold water.  There has to be something better out there!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I thought the idea of a bottle warmer was a rediculous waste of money before I had my daughter. I breastfeed, but have a hard time functioning in the middle of the night, so I pump during the day and warm a bottle for the baby in the middle of the night. For three weeks I boiled water in a pot and held the bottle with metal tongs...not ideal for someone half asleep. Once we coughed up the money for this warmer I was a much happier, half-asleep mom. It only takes about 8 minutes to heat a 5 oz. bottle. Since the heating elements are on the bottom of the product, I would suggest swirling the bottle and testing the temperature before giving it to the baby, better safe than sorry. Cleaning of the product is ultra-easy as well, vinegar, water and some soak time and it's good as new."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My mom got me this for a present because it used to be that you had to heat your bottles for formula.  Now you can feed the infants room temp, warmed, or cold.  I make the bottles as I feed so I feed room temp. and actually, this is what my baby likes most.  Sometimes I buy the ready to feed and store the bottles in the fridge so I warm them, but honestly, it takes a lot longer to do that than to just make the bottles.I think that this warmer actually takes longer to warm the bottles than to just put the bottle under hot water.  Just my opinion."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I like this bottle warmer.  It warms up the bottles quickly and that means alot at 3AM with a screaming, hungry baby.  I use the Dr. Brown's bottles with it and they fit fine.  I haven't had any problems with uneven heating or anything like that.  I have even taken the warmer with me when we go to friends houses so I can heat up the bottles quickly.  I strongly suggest that you do not put the nipples on the bottles while they are in the warmer.  It causes the formula to overflow from the nipple.  Found that out the hard way.  Other than that, I haven't had any problems or issues with the product. I would suggest this to parents looking for a small warmer."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My sister-in-law told us not to register for this because she couldn't get it to work.  Well, I wanted it and I registered for it anyway.  We got it and I decided to give it a try just to make sure it worked.  I used it the next time my friend came over with her newborn and it worked great.  Just add a little water, throw in the bottle, and in minutes it was perfect.  My only suggestions would be to add an on/off switch and a timer.  But other than that, it's another great product by Avent."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I first purchased another bottle warmer which I promptly returned because it did not work.  I received this bottle warmer as a gift from a friend who has three children, two of which are twins.  So, I figured she knew what was good and what was not.  And she was right, this works well.  I read some of the other reviews of this product but can only say I've had no problems with this.  It's easy to use and always warms the bottle just right...not too hot, not too cold.  I'm very pleased with this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this product as a combo with the Avent Sterilizer.  ((Side note: the Sterilizer is a MUST HAVE item!!))It's nice to have a place to warm the bottle, and it does cut down on wasting water (vs the other method of a bowl of warm water).  The biggest plus is it's faster to prepare.  The problem that I had with the bowl of water method is that I would over heat the water then have to do a cool down process.  I thought this product would help with that but it doesn't.  You can get the water to almost boiling.  You have to time it, but again, it's fast and ready to go in 6-7 minutes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this for a short time. It was more of a pain for us.I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there. A timer would have been nice (and cheap enough to add).I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it.Yes, it may be the best there is out there, but that doesn't mean too much. It still has many flaws.Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on. There is so much they could have done with this that they didn't. Oh well."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We started off sterilizing using the old-fashioned, boiling water in a pot...what a mess and waste of time! Standing over the boiling pot and risking steam burns ran out of fun very quickly. After I got over the sticker shock for the sterilizer and got it home, I couldn't see how we survived before! It's quick, easy and efficient. New moms have enough to mess with, don't spend you few, precious moments each day waiting for a pot of water to boil, splurge on this item and you won't regret it!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This sterilizer is GREAT!  My girlfriend boiled her bottles and I can't believe how much easier (and safer) this is!  This only takes minutes and no risk of steam burns!I also sterilized the Avent breast pump and all of its parts in this sterilizer.  It worked great!Another plus:  the two racks with the tiny holes (not the one that the bottles rest on) can be snapped together to form a \"basket\" if you wanted to throw stuff into your dishwasher.  I've never done that...I'd rather sterilize the bottles and nipples and stuff using the steam from the water and not use detergents from a dishwasher...my baby's not even a month old yet...maybe after he's older, I'll use that feature as well.  For now, this sterilizer is EXCELLENT!  Definitely worth the money!  We're very pleased with it.  We also have the Avent food warmer...another great buy!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this a few months ago and after reading a little about it, I thought that I wouldn't use it.  Boy, was I wrong.  I use it for all sorts of things.My niece dropped a sippy cup of juice in my car that wasn't discovered for a week.  I washed the cup.  When I removed the valve...NASTY.  I don't think it's ever been taken apart and washed.  After a second washing, I put all of the parts in this and let the microwave work it's magic.I love the lift out tray because whatever's in there that I'm sterilizing isn't sitting in the water.  It can also hold the Avent Isis breast pump.  The sterilizer is actually a great place to store your pump when it's just been cleaned and not in use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ama clean freak and ws parnoid from day one about germs and my first child. I live in an area with hard water and boiling things was not reassuring because the water left deposits on our nonstick cookware. I would wash her bottles and things , pop them in here and in the time it took me to finish cleaning the kitchen or toss some clothes in the dryer this would be done. I could leave the bottles in there or take them out and prepare for use while sterilizing pacifiers and other items. I use the Avent system and love this!Now that she is about 7 months I only sterilize once a week but this s so simple I do not regret my choice. Being a nurse I worried about my daughter catching something....this was just reassuring.Great as a gift...."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had an electric steraliser (which died) before buying this one.  I wish I had had this steraliser all along.  It's so easy to load up, everything fits snuggly and has it's place (I had trouble with bottles falling over in my electric steraliser), and extremely easy to wash and keep clean (the electric steraliser was a pain to clean - especially the element).As we use Avent bottles - 4 fit perfectly and are steralised in 8 minutes (our microwave isn't very powerful).  From the instructions it looks like other bottles fit easily as well.I use this daily and haven't had a problem with it - easy to use, easy to secure the lid and I use it for my bottles and dummies.Recommended if you are using bottles and especially the Avent brand."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This sterilizer is absolutely wonderful, especially if you take your baby on the road, i.e. to the grandparents' house.  If they've got a microwave, then you're ready to go.It's also very durable.  Ours gets lots of use every day and yet looks like it just came out of the box brand new.  Plus, unlike a bottle warmer appliance, there are no moving part or electrical components to wear out or break, so we expect we'll be using ours for years/babies to come."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is such a great item and I can't say enough good things about it!  I use it several times a day for pacifiers, baby bottles, and breast pump bottles.  It couldn't be easier than popping things in the microwave for 5 minutes and knowing that your baby is getting sterilized items.A word of advice- be careful about removing it from the microwave.  The water inside and the steam can scald if you are not cautious.  Let it sit for a few minutes before opening, because the water can splash when opening the lid."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this.  This is the most wonderful item I have gotten.  I clean the bottles and then load them into this.  4 to 5 minutes later, the bottles are all sterilized.  I love this.  Since I express milk and freeze it, it is reassuring knowing that the storage containers are sterile.  I also love it because you never know if you are washing the bottles and pacifiers and such with warm enough water (I am a first time mom).  With the sterilizers I just have that reassurance that everything is clean enough for my baby.  This is well worth the money.  It is so easy to use and comes with extra bottles."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We initially bought this sterilizer for use with our first child born in 2005. I loved it then, but I'm even more impressed with some updated details in the version we just bought for our second child. Before, putting on and removing the lid used to be a bit awkward. Now, easy-to-use latches have made doing both completely hassle-free. The inner steam tray also has more slots and spots that make arranging items easier. The older version was very similar but did not have specialized \"compartments\" to such an extent. All in all, it remains an extremely easy product to use because if I had to sit there sterilizing by boiling water and whatnot, it surely would not get done. That the sterilizer comes with bottles is pure bonus. I'd buy the steamer alone."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  The best sterilizing option since I don't have enough dishes to bother using the dishwasher more than once every two days.  Even if you just want to clean one pacifier, it uses less water and energy than boiling on the stove and it's quicker too.  It saves my skin from hand washing in scorching hot water  (but I still give things a quick rince in warm soapy water before tossing them in the sterilizer).  It is a lifesaver when pumping and bottle feeding.The only drawback is the space that it takes up - it is about 12 inches in diameter and 6 inhes tall.  But I use mine so much, I just keep it in the microwave when I'm not using it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "What more can you ask for? This is one of those baby products! It's VERY easy to use: so easy to use, you will learn to use it (believe me, this is important) &quot;in your sleep&quot;. It is inexpensive too: just shop around for other sterilizers and you will see this is the best one you can get for this price. Finally, and perhaps most important of all: this is an essential piece of baby gear. Sure, you can boil those bottles and those pacifiers, but let's face it: this is the 21st Century, and you might as well make use of your microwave."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I highly recommend this product whether you are breast or bottle feeding (or sippie cup for that matter). I did not originally register for this item because I didn't think it was necessary, especially since we have a dishwasher. This is a great tool to get all those baby/toddler items germ free. I mainly use mine for sterilizing my breast pump supplies, bottles, and pacifiers. 4 minutes in the microwave and its done. Its not necessary to sterilize all baby products but when something really needs to be, it sure beats having to run the dishwasher. There are just the 3 of us so we only need to run the dishwasher about twice a week. I find that I sterilize more often just because it is so easy to use this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Yet another great product from Avent!  This is so very easy to use and in minutes you have sterilized bottles, pacifiers, toys, pretty much anything that you can fit into the the thing.  We have a dishwasher, but our doctor advised that newborns can be sensitive to the soap the first few months.  Plus with animals in the house, we just like the idea of a little extra peace of mind.  By the way, we started with the electric sterilizer but after reading the directions and seeing it's size we returned it for this one.  This one is easier to store and use and is faster."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My almost 4 month old son is VERY small (24th percentile!) so the doctor recomended me buying a sterelizer, in other cases careful scrubing and just putting the bottles in the dishwasher would do, and it can save you some trouble. but for those people who need or really want a sterelizer, this ones great. Its much less expensive than the other sterelizers that take over all your counter space! It cleans my bottles very well, and I use mostly avent by the way. It can also sterelize my 2 1/2 year olds \"magic cups\" after he gets over a virus or if he had milk (another product by avent). It is fairly simple to use and much less stressful than boiling water, in my opinion. It also comes with 4 bottles, although my house is a bottle factory as it is! This sterelizer can also be used as a drying rack if needed. I love this sterelizer and it has kept my small son very healthy, happy and playful!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this one as well as the full size counter version. This one was really helpful with pacifiers and nipples. I had a harder time with bottles just cause not many fit in it. But I found that bottles in the dishwasher and nipples and pacis in the microwave steamer were much better. In the dishwasher the nipples sometimes come out with the white dish det. film on it, of course in the sterilizer..not..BUT please don't worry about being burned. Common sense tells you what to touch or not touch and honestly if you do it once...you won't do it again.. Overall better for the money then the bigger one from Avent."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When we bought this, I thought of it as a luxury item, because you don't really need to sterilize that much, but we never use the dishwasher and I thought it would be easier and safer than boiling water.  Turns out that we were diagnosed with thrush and had to sterilize many times a day.  So glad to have had this!!! Some have complained about the \"condensation\" but this is really just the very fine mist of the boiled water on the items.  Shows it's working.. just rinse it off with water and put the items in the drying rack."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this sterilizer. I am a breastfeeding mother and use the Avent Isis to pump milk from time to time. This sterilizer fits the Isis perfectly along with a few bottles, nipples and sealing discs. I wash my bottles out after I use them and put them away. When I'm ready to pump, I load this up and 7 minutes later I'm good to go. You don't need to dry the bottles or pump before using, if you use them right away. When I'm done, I wash my pump and store it back in here to dry. It stays there until I'm ready to use it again. I've never tried sterilizing any other bottles but the instructions specify how to place others in here so they fit well. It is very time saving, rinses easily, and works very well. I'm glad I've never had to resort to the boiled water on the stove."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "On more than one occassion I've had a crying hungry baby on my hands in teh middle of the night or the very early morning, and walked into the kitchen only to find that all of the bottles are in teh sink or in the dishwasher yet to be run.  It's much easier to keep my daughter distracted four the 4 or 5 minutes I need to wash and sterelize in this product than to wait for a load of dishes to run!  If this sounds like somthing that could happen to you . . . buy this product! (Or put it on your registry)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this sterilizer and AVENT products in a whole! I bought a sterilizer because I don't use the dishwasher at all, and well I just didn't trust it to 'sterilize' my baby's bottles well (especially the nipples!).  Well I must say that I'm very happy that I got this product.  It is VERY easy to store and does the job well. Avent bottles fit perfectly in it (as I'm sure you already guessed), but it also fits all other bottles!  I use it to sterilize my bottles, nipples, caps, pacifiers, teethers and breast pump parts.  I generally sterilize the bottles once a week, but if needed, I can take it out and sterilize her teethers, etc anytime."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We don't have a dishwasher so I throw everything in the sterilizer (bottles, breastpump parts, binkies, etc.)after washing with soap and water. It is easy to use, just throw items in, 7 ounces of water and microwave for 7 minutes. I use this sterilizer daily.I only gave it four stars because I put in the breast shield from my First Years breast pump and it melted a bit where the shield sat in the appropriate slot. I can still use the breast shield but there is a permanent dent melted into it. Otherwise, I love this sterilizer!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was the perfect solution for my pump parts and bottles. I read everywhere that you do not need to buy a sterilizer if you have a dishwasher, but I don't run my dishwasher fast enough to have my parts and bottles ready for each feeding/pump.  This fits all of my pump parts and 2-3 bottles and nipples.  It's ready in 4 minutes, which is way faster than dealing with the dishwasher.  You do need to prewash in soapy water, but I don't worry about scrubbing.  Overall, it does the job in a very short amount of time!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I saw this and just had to get it. It's good to wash and sterilize all bottles and breast pump parts before using them the first time.I own the Avent Isis breastpump and this has grooves for it to click into-very cool! I like to sterilize my pump once or twice a week, and once a week I sterilize the bottles and nipples.I can't ever wait for the washer to run, so instead of waiting, I just throw everything I want sterilized into the microwave for 4 minutes and it's done. It's so easy and simple.And it keeps things sterile for 3 hours unless you pop open the top right away!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "For weeks I boiled my ISIS pump parts and bottles, leaving on my non-stick pot calcium stain. As I was going back to work and my baby had to be bottle fed (thus more things to be sterilized), I found this great product and eagerly bought it. It's such a great invention! Everything (pump parts, nipples, dome caps, bottles etc) has slot of its own on the rack so they won't shift around. And if you keep the lid closed after sterilizing, contents stay sterilized for a day!Be sure to check your microwave power though, since it takes 4 minutes for a 1100watts microwave, longer for less powerful ones. Even though I have a 1350watts one, I do it for 4 minutes just to be sure!  And let it cool for recommended length of time to avoid scorching yourself.Enjoy this product and you won't regret."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was using a basket to hold wipes, lotions, etc and keeping on the changing table.  My daughter is growing and is very long so the basket was in the way.  I looked everywhere for a hanging basket but couldn't find one I liked for a decent price.  This diaper  depot is absolutely perfect.  It hangs perfectly on my changing table.  I did put a piece of fabric under it so the finish doesn't get scratched on the changing table.  I love having everything right there at changing/dressing time without taking up drawer space."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was worried this wouldn't work for us. We have a Pottery Barn Kids changing table that has a decorative moulding that sticks out about 3/4 inch beyond the frame of the changer top. This product hangs at a slight angle because of this, but it still hooks on solidly to the changer's top edge, and gives us much needed storage space for wipes up top. It is an inexpensive fix to a very annoying problem. Another bonus is that the plastic piece that the wipes container rests on is hinged to allow easy access below for loading diapers or whatever you choose to store in there."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this product to use on my Pack 'N Play.  It's definitely a nicer way to keep diapers and wipes organized at my Pack 'N Play changing table.  It fits onto the side of the Pack 'N Play nicely.  I wish the tub for the wipes box on top was deeper though.  The wipes box always tends to want to fall off when I'm taking a wipe out.  I also wish it held more diapers and that the diaper slot wasn't so wide, because when I pull out a diaper, about 2 or 3 want  to come out at once.  But all in all, this has been a nice item to have at my Pack 'N Play for diaper changing!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have mixed feelings about this product. When I first started using it, I can see and feel the difference. It actually started to literally peel the dark skin away. There's a bit of a sting but that's how I know it was working. My skin was lighter in just a couple weeks! However, once I've stopped using it when I reached my desired skin color, it went back to being dark. I applied more and suddenly it was no longer working. It didn't peel or sting. I wonder what went wrong or if it has an expiration date or something. Overall, it works but definitely not consistent."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the real Versace Bright Crystal fragrance.  My bottle was not open, tampered with, or have a strong alcohol smell. I love how clean this perfume smells. I tried it out at Macy's. I wanted to try a fendi  scent, but the salesman asked me to try Bright Crystal and another Versace scent. I smelled the other first and then Bright Crystal. I was instantly sold on the Bright Crystal. I sprayed it on myself and then came straight to amazon to get it at a fraction of the price. The bottle is huge! I'll be wearing this everyday to the office, I'm sure I'll receive tons of compliments. Because the scent is not overpowering and very clean, I don't have to worry about it being too loud in an office setting. Thanks amazon!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "So i have been using the Avalon Organics both Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now. I have seen a pretty good result. My hair has definitely gotten a bit thicker and stronger. I notice less hair falling out. I have combined this shampoo/conditioner with also taking Biotin Supplements so i do not know if its solely because of the shampoo/conditioner or a combination between the both, but improvement is there. My only one complain is that the conditioner doesnt give you that soft conditioner feel other conditioners give you.. Its a little rough as oppose to soft. In conclusion, if you have thin hair i recommend both products as well to supplement with a daily Biotin vitamin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought 2 of these in October 2011 and they are still working perfectly.  When I have a need for another one, I naturally come back to the same brand, same style - the  Classic - and ship and sold by amazon.I like the fact that when I need to refill, I can take each container out individually, plus the fact that there is one cover on the outside making it easy to keep it clean.Some other dispensers have 2 or 3 chambers and the chambers are all in one piece. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CD3T2U/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1You have to slide the whole thing out even if you only need to fill one chamber when others are still full.  In addition, the others not having a one-piece cover on the outside, water tends to get inside the chamber holding mechanism and mold can develop inside that you can't see without taking the chambers out.  I have a couple of those that came with a house I bought. This also reinforces my decision in going back to the 4-chamber Classic one."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought a similar type of dispenser back in 1995, when I was outfitting my new apartment. Perhaps that was the Dispenser Classic I. That one lasted 11 years without a problem and I threw it out only because it looked old and I was moving. Flash forward to 2011. I decided to buy one for my condo. A day or two after I put in the bottles, I noticed shampoo from the dispenser dripping onto the faucet. It turns out that one of the bottles had a hairline crack in it. It was tiny but enough to cause a serious leak. I examined the bottles closely and realized how thin and cheap the plastic containers really are. Unbelievable. Now I have to decide whether to use Crazy Glue or go through the hassle of emptying the two other containers and sending the whole thing back to Amazon for a refund. If this is the Classic III, I wonder how bad IV will be. I'd be hesitate to order this again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I think that the organizational system behind this is great - the bottles are reasonably easy to load and prime, the little windows let you know when you're running low on anything. There are several different labels included in the package, including a blank one, in case you want to fill it with lotion instead of body wash, or whatever.The mirror is rather small, but useful for checking your brows or, if you're a dude, your facial-shave job. It doesn't steam up, there may be a coating? Or I'm just getting lucky :)The flat shelf are on the top is useful for holding your razor, while the many hooks on the bottom help organize the scrubbies and loofas that seem to overwhelm the bathroom shelves normally.My only wish is that it's just a bit smaller, as the whole thing is maybe 14-18 inches across, which is a lot of visual space!"}

It's gotten my hands and forearms (and feet sometimes) through 84 rose bushes, countless tree prunings, landscape rehabbing, etc. I have found that even with cuts and scratches, this lotion never stings. All the herbs probably have an antiseptic effect on injuries, but who knows.The scent is wonderful too, at least I think so. Quite unique and natural, but not overpowering.Since the creme is very concentrated, I DO recommend letting it soak in well before you go driving or touching door knobs, etc. A little goes a LONG way! :0So glad they keep making this great product!PJ"}

I tried many MANY different creams at a drug store one day - 2 hours worth of searching from the least to most expensive creams lead me to this one. It has a light leather smell, so definitely good for men also (I like the smell of leather, so Im a big fan, even as a lady). I put it on after Ive washed my hands and it is thick, rich, and I enjoy massaging it into my knuckles. Once it's on, it doenst leave a sticky or greasy film, just lovely moisture and no dryess.

Now I have one tucked into my overnight bag for visits to the grandkids.The iron does everything I need it to do.  Heats quickly, evenly, and has an automatic turn-off.

It heats up quick. I think the buttons are perfect, I have not hit them once while using the tool. Curling iron came in super fast, came in2 days before shipment date! It did take me some practice to use this. After the third time, I finally got use to it. Overall this product is fabulous. I recommend this if you want a curling iron easy to use, something that heats up quick, shipment comes in super quick, and for a great deal!P.S If you are interested in this product, but unsure how to use it; go on youTube and look up &#34;How to curl hair with conair curling iron&#34;.

I could choose something more expensive and popular like Hot Tools brand but I was not very sure with the ideal that I would curl my hair often or even if I could curl it (lol) but this one works great (for me). It gets hot pretty quickly and doesn't take long to curl my hair. I like it, and I believe it's good buy. I read some comment said it doesn't last &#34;too&#34; long or something but I don't really mind. For the price, just can't beat it or at least give it a try!!!"}

The second it kept turning off or shorting out on me.  I changed outlets and still the problem continued.I would recommend this curling iron to a friend but perhaps not through the internet.I re-ordered thinking it was just a defective one and the second time, it wouldn't even heat up enough to hold a curl.

{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm no expert at beauty, so this is just one regular user's experience. However, I put it on and it stayed green, which had me worried. I blended it, and could see the blemish (red) peeking through, while the green remained stubbornly green. Given that it's a stick of concealer, it's a little insulting to think I did it wrong. Nevertheless, I removed it and tried again. Same result.So I went ahead and did my usual powder foundation/settling veil powder routine, and lo and behold - I could still see the blemish AND the green through my makeup.I'm not really sure what's going on. Perhaps I'm using the wrong color concealer? Either way, it really didn't behave or perform the way I expected or hoped it would. Good thing it was cheap because it has been sitting, unused in a drawer since day 1."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Im a WOC and I always wanted a yellow concealer for my under eye circles and I read the reviews and bought this one. The concealer by itself is really good quality, creamy texture, long stay,, good coverage plus in a convenient stick so u can just point n put. But honestly I gave it a number of tries and it just looked too pale on me, as in, less yellow more cream-white so it would show through even after blending and blending with my colour foundation. DOES NOT look good on me at all. I guess I'll have to find a proper yellow one in my country local brands, which cater to our skin colours. But that said, its a good product. I still use it for spot concealing."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have absolutely horrible dark circles, far beyond the point of being concealed with any type or amount of makeup, but this product significantly reduces their discolored appearance.This looks pretty good and almost unnoticeable once blended out with my ring fingers. However, I really need a primer or something with this or it creases horribly. It feels sort of greasy and heavy when applied, but if you go easy with it and just make it last by spreading and blending, it works. It looks even better if applied under flesh-tone concealer or foundation.My main problem is that the packaging isn't entirely hygienic, at least if you put the stick right on your skin. It could spread bacteria and cause breakouts, so maybe use a small brush or something with it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If you are looking for a makeup remover that removes waterproof mascara this works great. It is oily so you only need a tiny amount on a cotton ball or pad. After wiping off all the mascara I recommend that you wash your face and areas around your eyes with a liquid soap you'd use to clean your face normally. Then splash a lot of water around your eyes especially so there is no oily residue left. If you don't do this the oil can be slightly irritating and may make your eyes feel itchy. So make sure to remove the remover and you should have less problems.~The Rebecca Review"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This was the first waterproof liquid eyeliner that I used. When I first started using it, I loved it. However, I had nothing to compare it to. Since, I've used different drug store brands of liquid eyeliner and this one sort of fails in comparison. Don't get me wrong, it isn't horrible, but there are others out there that are better. It is waterproof, but it isn't air proof. It dries, cracks an then flakes off throughout the day. As it dries, it feels as if it tightens and shrinks (which causes the cracking). While it does this, IT ITCHES SOMETHING FIERCE! After a while, the brush starts to get weird and application gets messy. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I would not buy this liquid liner again.  I do like that it is waterproof, but I do not like that I have to apply, and reapply it several times before I can get it right.  I am used to being able to use an eye liner brush to smudge, and blend, or correct the line on my upper lid, and you can not do this with this eye liner.  If you do not like how you applied the line, it will flake off, yes, peel, and flake off, and you will need to start again.  But, once you get it how you want, it does stay.  I would not buy this liquid liner again though."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The brush for this eyeliner is horrible. I LOVE brushes, and prefer them over felt tips but this is the exception. The brush for this eyeliner is VERY small and too soft. It's hard to make a straight line because the bristles are just all over the place. Additionally, when you go over to reapply liner in some places - when it dries, it tends to look very clumpy and unflattering. I had such high hopes for this liner because of the brush applicator and how beautifully matte the color was but this is a total fail."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My family had used this product for many years but I had not been able to find it in a long time.  I have old feet, yep, there it is...I have old feet.  They have developed cracks and creases, callouses and snags.  My husband is a diabetic and foot care is of utmost importance for his wellbeing.  Pretty Feet & Hands is a great exfoliant for both of us.  I recommend using this at least once a week, though it can be used daily.  Bye-bye rough, dry, cracked, snags and such.  Hello to smoother, younger, healthier feet!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Simply put, there is nothing on this earth that removes rough skin for my feet.  My skin is baby smooth after use.  This product is rather messy; therefore I would suggest using the product outside.  Otherwise you are left with white skin bits on your floors that are rather unappealing and difficult to clean.  You will be astonished by how much new skin is revealed after using this product.  I also use it on my hands, knees and elbows.  My skin is highly sensitive and there are no adverse reactions to this product. I've been using this for over 10 years and wouldn't use anything else."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This may work on dandruff but does not work on seborrhoeic dermatitis. They are different. Dandruff is a generic term and coal-tar active ingredient products like this one may work on the kind of dandruff that flakes.If you have an itchy scalp which does not shed but instead causes sores, you may have the already mentioned seborrhoeic dermatitis. The latter is caused by clogged oil glands. It often takes place if you don't shampoo frequently. That was the case with me. I shampooed only once a week because I did not want to ruin my expensive hair-color. The problem took several years to really develop before my doctor and I finally figured out what was wrong. What you need instead is a shampoo like the kind of Selsun Blue which contains selenium hydride."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Judging by all the positive reviews I expect this stuff to work but it smells horrible. The stench is so strong to my nose. I collect colognes and so my nose is used to smell a lot of stuff and this stuff just offensive. After washing my hair and rinsing several times, I can smell this in my hair for over an hour afterwards. I don't even need to run my fingers through my hair and smell it... its just like an aura around my hair that stinks. Tried it for a couple days and I had enough.. If you don't mind the stench of tar, enjoy!I use head & shoulders instead. It works for me but is a bit damaging."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Very dry skin causes me to itch. Lotion takes care of the body but conditioner on the hair or conditioner shampoo products still leave my scalp dry. Used this product and the sensation of an itch on my scalp went away by about 80%. After a week, my scalp does not itch. Using regular shampoo again brings back the itch after a few days and then I use the T-gel again. The only downside is that hair that has been colored will lose its color. The T-gel also makes the hair dry and you have to take care if your combing it damp. When the hair dries, it is very soft. My naturally curly hair is curlier after using T-gel. Not having an itchy head is worth any downside."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "So far my experience with T/Sal has been really good.  I alternate it with T/Gel.  Between the two it really drops the banhammer on dandruff.  I had such bad dandruff that I could not even wear a black shirt.  Now I can and will only see one or two flakes here and there.  That is pretty impressive.I've found it to be ineffective on my seborrheic dermatitis.  i need to use something else for that.  But for dandruff...awesome."}

Yay!There's also no smell! I've tried head and shoulders, tar shampoo and hated the smell.This stuff is fragrance free. I love it :)Btw, haven't tried the conditioner but I use my ACV/Water spray as a conditioner after this shampoo. Works wonders, super soft curly hair with clean scalp :)"}

I found it at a local store more expensive than online, so I purchased it here.Wow o wow is my hair happy. My hair has a shine that wasn't there before, my hair seems stronger with the weekly use of the VO5 hot oil treatment and I'm having less issues with our humidity creating flyaways. My hair is noticeably softer to the touch, and easier to manage when I straighten. I'm no longer having to use the flat iron as long.Love love love this product.

{"label": 4, "raw": "I have suffered from chronic consitpation my entire life. I am 65 yrs old. I have tried many different types of fiber supplements and I keep coming back to Konsyl Natural Fiber.

Its been my personal experience that most electric shavers leave lots of stuble and it's hard to get a clean shave under the chin and throat area. For me, it usually requires more time to get a clean shave with an electric razor than is required when using a disposable razor.

I use a dab of cleanser, wet the puff and make little circles over my skin.  It is just enough exfoliation to get the dead cells off, but not so much that it irritates my sensitive skin.  I follow up with my skin care regimen (serum, toner, moisturizer) and this little puff has helped make a world of difference.Being the first time that I have used one of these, I am not sure how long they \"normally\" last, but I have gotten a good two and weeks of daily use out of mine, before noticing that it was beginning to lose it's structure a bit."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I know a lot of persons have commented on how great these Buf-puf sponges are, but I had to add my own praise.  I had previously tried the regular and found that they were a bit too harsh for my skin (I have both eczema and acne, so my face tended to get extremely sensitive even when I was gentle with the puff).  The gentle is perfect and  I'm happy I bought the 6-pack too.We're currently renovating at home and it feels so nice after dusting, sweeping and mopping every evening to be able to just put a little Cetaphil cleanser on it and just buff off all the dirt....no other scrub product required...I also use the body buf-puf for showering and can't help but feel nice and clean afterwards.A great little product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It saddens me to write this review because I've been using Buf Puf since I was about 12. I always attributed my youthful appearance to daily exfoliation with the Buf Puf, but now I think my cystic acne in my 30's and 40's was certainly exacerbated if not caused by the Buf Puf. I discontinued use of this product and switched to a skin care line called Glytone (buy at Dermstore.com) and haven't had a breakout in over 2 months. Unfortunately I'm convinced the harsh exfoliation causes skin to rebel and break out. I won't use again."}

I couldn't believe the difference!  Still as powerful in cleaning but not as harshly abrasive.  I get compliments on my skin all the time.

They last very well and I usually use one pad for about 6 months or so if I only use them on my face.  Also use them on my arms and legs before the use of artificial tanning products to exfoliate my skin, they are awesome for that!

Nowadays I have stumbled upon the simplest solution (astringent). I wear lots of makeup throughout the day and if I don't remove all of it I tend to break out.

I finally had figured out what worked for my skin and had a semi clear face with a pimple or two here and there (that time of the month, stress) but I needed just a bit more of moisture so I decided to try this moisturizer--BIG mistake. I usually brake out on my chin/jaw and in between my eyebrows/forehead so when I woke up the next day I had so many little white in those exact spots. I cannot tell you how upset I was and how itchy my face was. I hate this product and would not recommend this to somebody who has acne-prone, sensitive, oily skin.I only gave it a star because I could not give it zero stars!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I recently started breaking out on my cheeks and jawline which was never a problem area when I was in my teens. This works if you use it just like the directions say: on clean skin, once a day initially then increase to several times daily. On day two I use it like every 2 hours.It makes the pimple or, in my case, underground monster, less visible and less irritating. It gets rid of any pain or soreness that makes me want to pick and pop. After day two it completely disappears.Honestly, the best thing about this product is that it makes me keep my hands OFF my face which is likely why I break out in the first place. Oh, and I started changing my pillow case every night."}

I should have just broke the bank because this stuff broke my face.I was wondering why I was breaking out more than usual.  I typically break out along my lower cheeks, but it was spreading to my temples and forehead.I just bought my usual moisturizer yesterday, and I already see an improvement overnight.  It's gonna take a couple weeks to get rid of the mess this caused, I'm sure.Seriously, try to look for a more natural product.

It's super hard to find, harmon drug has it but other than that you gotta buy it online but it works well. The key is to use a diffrent wash cloth for your acne area then the rest of your body so you dont spread the germs and oils that make acne worse, then ONLY twice a week or so use those scrub gloves (VERY GENTLY) to exfolitae the areas. If you rub too hard it can cause more acne. But this stuff works well on backacne so far."}

It does burn/sting when you first put it on, I have sensitive skin and definitely felt the prickles the first time I have used this - nothing intense or painful, but you should be aware.Value - I have found a very small amount of this cream goes  a LONG way, which is nice. A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it's great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time. One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Alpha Hydrox might as well close it's doors.  I don't know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price.  Now they cost twice what they did then, understandable with inflation, but don't work worth a darn.  Yet another epic fail.  I am so disappointed in this product line.  I purchased several different products a few months ago and after finishing the bottles am still convinced they are absolute garbage.  They do not do what they claim but if you just want a lotion...here you go.  They are just like any other plain old lotion."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am 45 and this stuff works.  I have used a lot of different products since my teens.  I have NEVER been disappointed with Alpha products.  Simply they work.  Alpha product lines tend to fly low in an already over stimulated market of commercials and new product wonders that appear in constantly in an ever changing money making industry devoted to our own vanity (present company included).  But these products work!  I can testify to that.  The best thing is they are high in concentrate and low in price that is an A+++ in my book."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I usually read ingredient lists carefully, but I guess the name fulled me and I thought this product had some AHA's.  After using it for a while and not seeing or feeling any difference (AHA's should sting a bit) I checked and sure enough, despite the name, no AHAs.  I wanted a product with AHAs and think the company's name is deceiving on such a product.  I thought they only sold products with AHAs.  Perhaps they aren't doing this intentionally, but it is confusing and I wanted to let everyone know in case you were fooled too."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel with good success for the last year.  I decided to try Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash based on good reviews (see beautypedia dot com) and a sale price.The first time I washed I used way too much and took awhile to wash it all off.  After that I switched to pea-sized squirts and it foams up and cleans great.  My skin is dry to normal and I haven't had any of the problems reported by the low reviews.I'll continue to alternate the three products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I wanted a good face wash that doesn't sting my eyes and leave them bright red with irritation.  I read another reviewers comments that this face wash was non irritating to your eyes & decided to give it a try. It does the job and doesn't irritate my eyes unless I intentionally open them while I'm washing my face. Stupid, I know, but I kind of wanted to see if it would burn? So here's the report: not too much. It did burn but not nearly as much as some others I've tried AND it washed out instantly & didn't leave my eyes scarlet with irritation.My personal favorite face wash is by Philosophy - but that's a huge bottle and really pricey. This is a great size, doesn't take up too much real estate on my bathroom counter & does the job.  I'll definitely order again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Got a very bad rush from it. I might have very sensitive skin.Used it two days and I started noticing my face was itching and a small swelling near my cheeks. I thought it was something I ate or just a bad day.I continued using face wash for 3 days and rash wouldn't go away. I stopped using it and notice rash disappeared. This is just my experience.I was worried that since is a care product I wouldn't be able to return it and that I was stuck with the face wash but Thanks to the great customer service of Amazon I was able to get a refund and dispose of the face wash."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this product because I was so impressed with the Alpha Hydroxy Face Lotion, as it leaves my skin bright and clear and I have minimal break outs, so I figured the facial wash would do the same.. So I stopped using my normal face wash and I used this product instead for about a month and I noticed more irritation if anything... It wasn't really stopping my breakouts just leaving my skin red with more bumps than normal. I thought using the both in conjunction would just work best but I'm starting to think my skin is too sensitive and cannot take too much of the same thing? I am not quite sure... but I'm going back to my old facial wash and sticking to the alpha hydroxy face lotion. Another thing is that facial washes really do not exfoliate your skin.. They just tone it.. and I think I need more exfoliation or I wish they had exfoliation beads in this product.. Maybe it would've worked better? Idk.."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this face wash on and off for YEARS!I just saw this at Ulta for around $6 so I will use this until they stop selling it.I started using Alpha Hydrox about 8 years ago. I had bad acne from using the pill and was on ProActive.This cleanser worked just as well and it wasn't $40!My skin was so soft and seriously, after one day of use my skin cleared up.I'm so happy I found this again. They've stopped selling this at most drug stores.I have dry skin during the winter and super oily during the summer. This is great cleanser during the summer months.It's a bit drying on my skin during the winter so I use Aveda moisturizer after.Btw,If you love Aveda cleansing gel, you might like this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have suspicions that this  may be a counterfeit.  I purchased this because it was rated so high.  After washing and drying my face, my face starts to burn.  I then have to rush and put moisturizer on my face as quick as possible to avoid/eliminate the burning.  I have also noticed some dry patches on my face since beginning to use this.  Finally, my face burns during the day if I happened to sweat outside.All three of these experiences are new to me.  I have never experienced any of these things with any other cleanser."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this to help get rid of the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and legs. The lotion did not help smooth out the little bumps and I found something better instead. Since I still had the whole bottle, I decided to use this as my night time moisturizer. I'm in my 20's so I have minimal wrinkles so I can't attest to how well it helps with those. My skin does feel tighter after using this though. Sometimes I use another moisturizer alongside this one because it can be drying. I wouldn't use it by itself if your skin is on the dry side. My skin has been smoother since I've been using this moisturizer and I haven't had a breakout in a while. I'm not 100% behind this product, but I think it is doing what it is supposed to for my face."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had done a lot of reading on treating cellulite and stretch marks and found a recommendation to try glycolic acid and AHA. I did a search on Amazon and stumbled upon the Alpha Hydrox which had some good reviews so I decided to give it a try.I've been using it for about a week now, twice a day and I am actually seeing a reduction in the appearance of cellulite! I've been using on my hips/thighs/booty in conjunction with zone-specific exercises (which in the past by itself hasn't produced results like these). I was never overweight or large, so there was never a lot of cellulite, but enough to make me self-conscious in a swimsuit.I would say that the appearance of stretch marks is still the same, but for the price of the bottle this is definitely worth it for combating cellulite!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Let me start my \"story\" by saying I\"m a black woman, age 47 and have always had great skin. . most people think I\"m 35. So I decided to \"invest\" in my skin now that I\"m getting older by trying a product that helps preserve your youthful looks.  I read all the reviews on this before I ordered it as I do with most things I order from Amazon, and was overall impressed.  So, when this arrived I couldn't wait to try it to see if I noticed any difference.  Within a week I did but not before my skin had it's little reaction to it.  Yes it stung, yes I had a few little bumps pop up, couple red blotches, . .perhaps it was some \"junk\" working its way out -- because after that my skin looked more even, more radiant, little lines were less noticeable. . I really like this and will be sticking with it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I received this last night and washed first with a mild soap then a Glytone Body wash with a loofah.  After, I applied this and when I woke up this morning, I noticed a change in my skin already.  *I have KP (Keratosis Pilaris) on my back and small areas of my thighs* Don't expect a miracle overnight, but expect to notice a change in the way your skin feels instantly.  You don't need to apply much of this product.  A small, less than a dime sized amount, is more than enough to work with.  On the box it says that if application does not dry within a minute or less, you've used too much.  It's true.  I think this is a steal for the price and the thickness of this product.  I look forward to more results after a week, two weeks, a month, etc. and will be back for a second review.  7/24/13"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If you want to live your life like a vampire...this is the right product for you! Why? Well, I found out the hard way, Glycolic Acid increases your skins sensitivity to the sun. A warning was issued on the lable, but silly me didn't think it would be that big of a deal. I burnt horribly the next day from 20 min. of sun exposure! YIKES! Not worth it.It does, however, improve the look of the skin, the price is great, and there is no fragrance(YAY). BUT, like most beauty products, it has dimethicone, which is an acne irritant. If you have horrible acne like me, dimethicone is TERRIBLE for you! Find something with out it! If you don't, than this might work nicely for you. Dimethicone is bad no matter what, but it wont hurt your skin appearance if you have no acne."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product didn't say whether it could or could not be used on the face, however, I chose to use it on the face because the active ingredient was Glycolic-AHA. It broke me out on the forehead and scattered acne on my cheeks and jawline. I recommend acne.org's AHA lotion. I've been using ACNE.ORG's skin line for a year and they have an AHA lotion along with acne care and it works amazingly. I actually had to go back to it and it cleared my acne up again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product seems to be making my fine lines fade. I only use it around my eyes and sometimes my forehead on the horizontal creases. I have used it almost nightly for about a month, and even though my sleeping has been less than desirable, my fine lines are definetly minimized. I am using this as a preventive measure (I am only 24 years old) so not sure how it would work on more mature skin. My one criticism is that it also seems to dry my face out slightly. This product is very potent with Alpha Hydroxy Acids(10%) which can cause irritation, photo-sensitivity and flaking. Research has shown that AHA can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but there is little evidence to suggest long-term efficacy."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I recently purchased this from a local store, I have to admit I only bought it because it was reduced price.  But I have be using it twice a day for two weeks and the difference in my skin is very apparent.  I am a black 46 yr. old, since using this my skin glows, my cheeks are naturally rosy, my skin tone is evening out and my pores look better.  And my skin is so soft like a baby's.  I will be definitely be using this for quite some time, and the amount you get 6oz. is quite a lot of product.  In addition to my face and neck, I have be using it on hands and they are smoother and less wrinkled.  I wish I could bath in this stuff.  I would highly recommend it and there was little to no smell from the product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't know what it is about AHA products but they all make me break out insanely. I thought maybe it was just the face wash so I tried the lotion because of all the amazing reviews but it was horrible. First, it doesn't blend well into the skin. Within two days of using it I have acne all over my face, blackheads and huge cysts. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has acne. There are waaayy better products, like Bliss No Zit Sherlock.Edit: I had 2 people say this review was \"unhelpful\" so maybe I should clarify. I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all, I've never had a rash or any type of allergic reaction to a face product before. Maybe this is an allergic reaction, there's a first time for everything! Personally, I just think this product is not good for people who have acne, but it could just be me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "So i was a bit skeptical about this product at first. I tried it for a whole week and let me tell you-brighten skin tone-acne going away-old acne scars fading-new acne scars fading-softnes-smoothnessI just dont really like the smell. I did a patch test as they said. It burns on acne marks alil but no harm just working.How I use it before I go to bed i apply a peas size that all. I even started using it for my toes knuckles they have gotten hard from last summer.. and its helping!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been having acne issues since i was 13 and im now 23. Nothing ever seem to work for the acne scar. I am usually skeptical about people reviews but I heard that AHA could help and i gave it a try. My goodness! Its only been 2 weeks and i am already seeing great improvements in the texture, tone and the overall health of my face. The price is just right and the quantity is definitely worth the bang for your buck. Don't be scared when you get a burning sensation, thats normal and proof that it is working. Out of all the products i have used to treat my acne marks, this is by far the best and the price is a bonus! This will have your skin looking so young, fresh and alive. You will glow! Im so happy and slowly regaining confidence. i can't wait to see future results."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was very skeptical about buying this because I have tried just about everything out there on my skin. I haven't had any noticable results until now. I use this with Alpha Hydrox facewash. My skin has never looked better! After the first week I noticed amazing results. I have oily acne prone skin, but the combination of the two products has made a huge difference in my life. My complection has never looked better. I finally feel comfortable going without my make up, which I haven't done that since I was 13, pathetic huh?  I reccommend this to EVERYONE! It's worth every penny! I started noticing fine lines in my forehead so I wanted to find a anti-wrinkle cream to help with all my skin issues,uneven skin tone, breakouts, oily skin, etc.After a 2 weeks of this wah la! PERFECTION!!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts. The worst part are the red marks that hang around for weeks even after the blemish is gone. This product is not only keeping my skin clearer, thus avoiding more red marks, it's also fading the red marks that were already there. My face hasn't been this clear in a long, long time. I use it once in the morning and once at night. It goes on nice and light under makeup - I can't even tell it's there. I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm 48 and Mom is 75 yrs old and ANY moisturizer gives us immediate acne.  I'm glad I found this again, the AH souffle is a tad oily.  The no-oil formula is a godsend, no more breakouts.  The product exfoliates according to how much and how often you use it (overuse will get you a red face).  It provides a gentle peel effect that starts working quickly drying up oil and acne.  I like the rate of peel; no scaly face. In 2-3 months I had smoother skin, slightly smaller pores, and better skin tone.  Using Alpha Hydroxy I have received the first EVER complements on my skin. I have very few wrinkles for my age.  I'm not saying I look 30, but I look good.  Mom's a recent convert, her skin has smoothed and she has noticed a difference."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Highly recommend for oily skin. Could be a little drying for other skin types, though. I have had excellent results with this product, and I have tried EVERYTHING, both over the counter and prescription. I find this works best during my \"downtime\" from Renova--I take 3-6 months off after an 18-month stretch to give my skin a break. During the down time I use ROC at night and this in the morning. It mimics the dermatologist-prescribed routine I am normally on, just gentler. Be sure to wear at least SPF 15 when using this product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is heavier than the lotions so I normally use it on my arms and legs, and a dab on my face at night with the lotion. It's fragrance free, doesn't break me out and helps with winter itching. I recommend for sensitive skin types like mine, because cold weather makes my life miserable. Always has. Dry skin, rough hair and five months of no light. At least there's a lotion line out there that cures one of those issues. Could the makers of cetaphil please destroy winter as we know it? I'd really appreciate it, if this global warming deal doesn't work out...thanks. Oh by the way, I think they changed the formula because it's easier to spread."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Well, you've no doubt heard from some other reviewers that cetaphil's moisturizing lotion formula is greasy so I won't beat that into the ground. It does bother me that a product with the 'lightweight' and 'non-greasy' monikers does not live up to expectations. However, if you put a very very small amount of water into the bottle (several drops), just enough to curtail the thick viscosity, you should be fine.Aside from that the product does the job. If you are looking for a non-comodegenic, hypo-allergenic product then this is for you. If you are also looking for an oil-free product, then this is not for you."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I moved to the high desert plains a couple of years ago and the combination of low humidity and hard water began to wreak havoc on my skin. I've tried many different products at many price points, including some extremely expensive ones. Lotions did not last and most creams I tried felt too heavy or either looked *or* felt greasy. This Cetaphil formula has the perfect balance for me; it is light enough to sink in deeply and thick and creamy enough to make my skin feel incredibly soft and have that feeling last.TIP: I buy this extra large size to keep the cost low but I reuse small cream containers to make this \"portable\".Leaves my skin soft and supple. Doesn't leave a scent. Doesn't cause breakouts. Quite simply the best!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Absolutely love this cream.  I have combination skin with oily t-zone but my skin dries out near my cheeks, near my eyes and chin.  I use this cream twice a day--once at night after a shower and once in the morning after washing and cleaning my face.  A lesser moisturizer would result in dry skin by lunchtime but this cream really keeps my skin moist and soft.  Super safe around eyes and works into skin really well.  No added scents!  I've tried lots of different moisturizers and this one is by far the best."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Ok, so I'm anal.  I pour over reviews for hours before making a purchase.  It was so well worth the effort in finding the Cetaphil cream!  This cream is light weight, but works wonderfully.  I really don't understand the few reviewers who said this cream was heavy or greasy.  At 52 and still prone to acne from moisturizers, this cream is fabulous!  I purchased a chemical peel that recommended this product for use after treatment and I am so glad I did.  No breakouts, hydrated skin and a steal compared to the other \"miracle\" creams out there.  Also, my hands and legs have never been so smooth and soft.  No more oily/greasy feeling on my hands and legs as with other moisturizers.  Plain and simple, this product works!Thank you Amazon.  Your review system, lightening fast shipping and unlimited selection of products keeps me coming back again and again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a very good moisturizer but it does take a while to sink in and stays kinda greasy so you have to blot. I have been using bp which is drying and this does help but it has no spf and is a little too thick for daytime so I am switching to something formulated for just that. Good moisturizer for nighttime. I def recommend just not for me at the moment. Good luck!EDIT- i now use this around my eyes in the morning because my morning moisturizer has sunscreen in it (the kind you cant apply in that area) and also at night on my upper eye area, i use vitamin e oil as my nighttime under eye serum lol. It keeps it moist and supple! And when my back is dry from using bp. Anyone could use this even for something as simple as hand lotion its good"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find.  I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn't cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.I'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads).The only downside is that it won't remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This 4 oz side is perfect to throw in your gym bag or overnight suitcase."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using moisturizer from all stretches of the earth. NuSkin to dead sea to japanese products to Exuviance. This one moisturizes very well. The thing about less-expensive moisturizers are that they do the same job, but they are thicker. I have been having drier skin, overall after using this for a year, so I'm not sure if the long term benefits are good. My skin looks older but I don't think it is due to this product or just aging. This product is a bit too much for summertime, if you have an oily/shiny t-zone."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have sensitive skin and combination at that. I used to spend much more money on the kinerase moisturizer. But I decided to try other brands so save some money. After several attempts on different brands. I found this gem! Diamond in the rough! It lasts me a long time and I have no reaction to it. I only hope they don't discontinue it any time soon because I really don't want to find another one and chances are, it will be much more expensive. At this price you should definitely try this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have oily acne prone skin and I started getting fine lines around my eyes. I usually like Neutrogena products but this one is a dud. First, it doesn't lather at all. I've had an issue w/ it actually sliding off my hands a few times since it doesn't lather. Second it has a weird smell. Third it doesn't work. I'm delusional in thinking that a few months using the product will suddenly make my fine lines disappear but there is no difference at all. Plus my skin is still oily and I've broken out several times since I started using it. After this bottle I'm done. I'm in the market for something new."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I can't find this is ANY stores.  Neutrogena makes something similar in a pump, but I hear that it's pretty harsh on the skin.  I got this due to rave reviews -- and Thank You Amazon for carrying it --- and I absolutely love it.  I wear it almost nightly under my moisturizer.  My skin is smoother and appears fresher in the morning.  It did make my nose peel a little bit, but that's when I take a night off.  I really like this and hopefully can continue to buy this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this product for 3 weeks and have had great results. I have dry, sensitive, blemish prone skin. I'm in my late 20's with severe environmental allergies and mild acne. I cannot use Benzoyl Peroxide as it's too irritating and actually makes my skin swell.  Retinol, AHA and BHA are the only OTC products I can use without breaking out. This product is not hard on my skin and I've noticed my acne clearing since I've started using it. In the morning, I can see my blemishes have healed some compared to the night before. I have also noticed old blemish spots fading significantly.  I also like that it comes in a tube rather than a jar. The antioxidants and other ingredients won't spoil that way. Good for Neutrogena for coming out with this product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried nearly all of the major anti-aging creams out there. I've tried all the big drugstore brands (olay, Roc, etc), I've tried department store brands (clinique, origins, etc), and I keep coming back to this one every time. I love that it does not have a fragrance (the overpowering scent of perfume is what turned me off from Roc). I love that it's not greasy, but yet it gives me just the right amount of moisture before bed. Most of all, I love that this 30-something girl still gets carded regularly when I buy a bottle of wine at the grocery store. Really, what more can a girl ask for from a wrinkle cream?"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My Dermatologist told me to start using this when I was 25 since i had a bad scaly patch and just could never ever get a grip on my dry skin. I have super dry skin and had been trying all kinds of stuff, even vasoline and olive oil. My skin is so dry it hurts after I take a shower. Anyway I've used this, and only this plus the other night one in the pump - and my skin looks awesome and I'm almost 40 now. I stopped when I was pregnant, and when I had the baby as these creams may not be good for pregnant ladies or infants (they don't know but it's a lot of vitamin A so play it safe). I just used coconut oil (straight) during those times. EVERYONE has always told me they CANNOT believe my age, I look way way young for my age. I can show you a photo if you want."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "All the neutrogena are very effective when it comes to anti wrinkle and acne fighting, only draw back if you are prone to have sensitive skin like me, be careful how much you apply, and how often you apply it, otherwise it will really dry your skin out and your skin becomes very itchy.So make sure to follow the directions, do only apply to the effected area, stay away from anywhere from the eye area, about 1 inch at least, and try it out first and use it every other day or so.Even as I keep my Neutrogena products on hand for emergencies,:) , for the day to day use you maybe want to check out the Lush products that are also on sale here on Amazon. Dream Creme, amazing moisturizer(also for people who have dry skin due to Caner treatments !!!!) , Vanishing creme, amazing moisturizer for acne prone skin, deminishes redness, acne scars, and Herbalism, an organic cleanser."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "with just 1 month of using this product my skin already feels so much smoother.  for people that wear makeup this is great for it soaks in very fast and doesn't just lay on top of the skin before you put your makeup on.  i have it delivered monthly and i use in the am and pm.  if it's been a very warm day i put it on again in the afternoon.  love that it has a sunscreen in it.  no such thing as using too much of this in the florida climate.  i highly recommend this.  i don't see however that it would work well for excessively dry skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the best cleanser I have used in years.  I have 30 year old skin that is starting to look a tiny bit tired after two kids and lack of sleep.  In addition I have break outs still on a regular basis or should I say I did until using this product.  Since using this product my skin is looking refreshed and I have ZERO breakouts, even around that time of the month.  I ran out and was using some sample products I had on hand and what a mistake, my blemishes came back almost instantly.  As soon as I returned to using this product my skin was clear and feeling great.  I use it once a day in combination with the Neutrogena lavender face wipes at night.  This product is not a scrub, but a creamy sort of cleanser.  I would recommend this product for sure, no hesitation."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I never thought a body oil would be so great.  When I hear \"body oil,\" I think, \"greasy,\" \"thick,\" and \"gross.\"  Neutrogena body oil is none of those things.  I squirt a little in the tub when I run a bath, and it keeps my skin from drying out.  After I shower, I put it on my legs and they never get dry, either.  It's so light that you don't feel it at all, and the scent is very light too.  I did, however, order the unscented version for when my current bottle runs out.  My husband is hooked on this stuff too.  We keep a bottle in the shower, and when we turn the water off, we just put some on our arms and legs before we get out.  That way, we don't have to use a lot of heavy lotions instead."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "As a body oil it's just fine.... I like to use a cap full in a bath. It makes my skin very soft. It will make your bathtub just disgusting though, you will have to clean it after.But the smell.... It's not my favorite to begin with, but it's ok. It's just SO strong!!!!! I give it 3 stars because it works well and does what it supposed to, but I actually don't use it. I can't handle the scent, or its strength of scent I guess."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is my favorite thing on the planet! I have been using this body oil for years and years (15+ years). I use after shower before drying off, then my regular body lotion, makes my skin super soft and leaves a nice scent behind (if you like the smell that is, also comes unscented). I recommend to everyone and I know a lot of women who use it that also love this body oil. It is a little uncomfortable to get out of towels (also leave scent behind on them) but soaking in detergent for a few hours does the trick. Just leaves a silky soft finish on your skin, not on your clothes, great for dry winter skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First of all, I always buy the unscented body oil because I use a dropper and squirt some of my favorite aromatherapy essential oils into it before I use it. It takes no more than one dropper full to completely scent the entire bottle of body oil. Impressive, and with heavier oils like sweet almond it takes alot more than just one dropper to carry the scent.I use this after my shower, and just a few drops on my hand can cover an entire body area (lower leg, upper leg, arm, ect). I find the moisture to be helpful, but not enough for my legs, so I use lotion there, too. But it helps, definitely. Plus it adds a sexy sheen (as in shine, not Charlie).It's also great for suntanning, though suntanning is bad for skin anyway...this at least helps keep the skin moist and isn't so heavy that it makes me feel sticky afterwards."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have tried all kinds of oils over the years to combat dry skin.  I love this Neutrogena body oil, I love the large bottle it comes in, it has a great flip top that makes it easy to use, without making a huge oily mess.  It smells great, it goes on smoothly and is easy to blend in.  I will be ordering more of this, it works so well.  It has helped me get rid of a patch of very dry skin I had on the back of my neck.  I just put this on after a shower, when the skin is still moist.  It really moisturizes and isn't greasy."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "BUT NOT ANYMORE!!! This product is awesome. I put just a wee bit in my bathwater and voila!! Gets to places I was too lazy to reach. I'm not itchy from this terribly dry winter we're having and my skin doesn't feel tight. I love to also use this oil as a massage oil. There's no fragrance which I like because it allows me to put on perfume without feeling too scented.Pros:Not greasy in the bathtubHydratingSoothing for itchy dry skinSpreads easilyAbsorbs quicklyCons:Can get a little priceyMust...have....more....."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Neutrogena oil free moisture SPF 15 is amazing. The bottle has a little pump that makes it very easy to dispense. The product goes very far and you only need a little bit. This product is great for people with dry/semidry or combination skin. It helps combat dry skin in the places that need it without adding additional oil. It is also good to put under makeup. It causes much less foundation to be used up due to the fact that the skin is already moisturized. It also has SPF 15 which is great for the summer when you're not outside for long periods of time. (For long periods of sun exposure, I would suggest a higher SPF.) This product does smell a bit like sunscreen so there's no secret to what you're using!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used to use the Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, but decided to try this since my skin does tend to be oily. The lotion itself is very thin. Instead of my normal one application, with this lotion I need to apply twice, otherwise my face is dry and flaky--once after getting out of the shower, and another time before putting on my make up. The 2 stars is for the fact that my skin does look and feel good using this lotion, but there are plenty others that do just as good a job with just half the amount."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have 30 years old, white female. Had acne all thru my 20s, it's clearing up the older Im getting but this moisturizer has been a LIFE saver. I have tried so many other products out there, Simple, Clinique, Coconut Oil, Oil of Olay, etc... and nothing worked. They were too greasy, too smelly and caused breakouts or over drying and made my skin feel tight. Read many reviews on this, purchased this at my local Walmart and have been IN LOVE with this ever since. I use before my makeup every morning. 1 pump is plenty- apply to face, let dry (5 mins or so) and then apply makeup. I use a Neutrogena Night cream as a night moisturizer, but this would work fine too! So happy with this. No break outs, leaves my skin feeling wonderful and just enough moisture to NOT be oily! Deff reccommend this as a try! : )"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have sensitive skin that seems to be becoming more and more sensitive as time goes on. I've tried lots of different products claiming to be great for sensitive skin, but those claims don't usually hold true (they either make me break out or itchy or have scents, etc. in them that are irritating....or are for more mature skin) but this stuff does! It moisturizes without being greasy or causing irritation. I've been using it for about a year now and I've never had any problems with it. Usually lotions will cause me to break out in a purple patchy rash around my mouth, but this doesn't at all. It does need a few minutes to really absorb into the skin after applying it though (at least before starting to put on make up or whatever). Definitely recommend!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For years I have struggled with dry, acne-prone skin, and all moisturizers I tried caused me to break out, left my face feeling oily, or would wear-off and would need to be re-applied throughout the day. This is the first moisturizer I have tried that works for my sensitive skin without any of those problems.This product dissolves quickly without oily residue and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day (until I wash my face my again).  I use this product twice a day (morning and night) after I wash my face, and I love it!  If you are struggling to find a good facial moisturizer, I would definitely recommend this product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I chose tiis moisturizer because it did not have SPF in it and it was advertised as not to clog the pore on my face.  I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay.  I have always used a moisturizer after shaving, it does a far better job of soothing the skin thanalcohol based products P.S. after about 1/2 of the bottle the pump no longer will pump and you are left with 1/2 bottle that you have to beat out with your hand to get it.... I won't make this mistake again of ordering this... Shame of them..."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a great product but it is not what I would call a hand &#34;cream.&#34;  The formula is a yellowish almost clear oil/petroleum-like based formula.  It does absorb into the skin but not completely.I would not use this during the day to avoid leaving greasy prints on things.  This is a great product to use at night because it does absorb somewhat into hands and the residue creates a &#34;mask&#34; soaking completely into the skin after a few hours.  It leaves hands very soft and well moisturized; perfect for night treatments.If you have severely chapped dry hands this is a great product because it will not cause a burning sensation that most hand lotions will.  The formula is extremely gentle and would work on most cases of dry cracked skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First of all, thank you to all the other reviewers who persuaded me to give the Norwegian Formula Hand Cream a try! I can't remember the last time my hands were this soft... if ever.It took a little less than 7 days of regular use to smooth my rough, winter skin and now my hands are soft all the time and that includes after washing dishes.  There is no scent so the men in the household also did not mind giving it a try. I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from chronically dry, rough hands and probably will never buy another brand of hand cream again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This stuff really does work. The hype is real. I have been using Crabtree & Evelyn's gardner's hand therapy for years and have really liked it, but this stuff just plain works better. The other stuff is good though, if you need an alternative, but it's more expensive and frankly isn't as good.I live in the Pacific Northwest, which typically doesn't have a very dry climate. But we are having a very cold spell right now with no moisture in the air and my skin is drying up something awful. And, this stuff has saved my hands and, believe it or not, my face! I use argan & maracuja oils on my face typically and they do wonders, but this magic potion is taking care of a pesky dry spot on my face as we speak.This stuff is fragrance free too, so any of you sensitive folks will have no problem. And a little goes a long way as it is very concentrated."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm absolutely in love with this hand cream. Since it's winter my hands have been cracking a lot and feeling really dry. If it isn't the weather, it's washing my hands too often, but this cream has completely healed my hands. After one or two uses (overnight) my hands feel and look better! You need only a small amount to get this result too (:It does feel a little tacky after you apply it, but give a minute or two and it'll sink into your skin. It'll be like it's not even there!I totally recommend this product. No doubt in my mind."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Every winter my hands get really chapped.  Even if I wear gloves.  They crack and bleed and are just not attractive.  Every year I try to find something that works.  I took a chance and bought this item.  It's amazing!  I put some on last night and immediately noticed that my knuckles weren't as tight and my skin was softer.  Applied a little more before bedtime.  This morning, my hands are silky smooth.  There's no cracking, no chapping and they look amazing!It is thick, and until it absorbs it leaves your hands feeling a little weird.  But it doesn't take long to absorb and that feeling goes away.  For the results, it's well worth it!I recommend this product to anyone who can't find anything that works."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I applied the cream correctly every time, and it soothes effectively and provides a protective barrier for the skin, BUT does not deliver moisture to the skin The product doesn't have much moisture in it in the first place because it is \"concentrated\" apparently but i need moisture!! WHY ELSE WOULD I BUY HAND CREAM? obviously i want to moisturize my dry hands.The texture is grainy, I'm guessing it's the concentrated bits of dried cream or something, but it's very unpleasant feeling. It smells like plastic even though it's fragrance free."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I live this product - it is great as a moisturizer and isn't too heavy for my oily skin. I love the scent but, unfortunately, I think that is what made my skin tingle when I first started using it. The tingle has gone away, for the most part, but people with sensitive skin or people (like me) who use things like Retin-A that make their skin sensitive, take note. I think next time I'll try the Olay Pro-X Age Repair Lotion or the Total Effects 7-In-1."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Since I've turned 20, I have had problems with blemishes. So, for the last few years, I began to try many different face cleansers and lotions to solve the problem, and finally stumbled upon this one. It's lightweight and definitely moisturizes just enough. I never feel like my face is oily or greasy. My blemishes haven't completely gone away, but ever since I began using this lotion, my skin has been noticeably clearer. I assume it's because it doesn't clog my pores like my old lotion must have. The only complaint I have is about the bottle. When you squeeze it, you either get no lotion, or the lotion explodes everywhere. I wish they would put a pump on the bottle or something, so that I wouldn't be wasting so much lotion when I barely squeeze it and it all comes flying out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser.  I am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream.  It gave me a migraine and an asthma flare-up.Also I am disappointed that it did not remove my mascara and did NOT do a good job at removing my eyeliner either.  I don't wear heavy makeup so this should not have been an issue for this product.  It's really too bad because it is a good price and I can't afford more expensive products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This does have the extra ingredients that some people on here are unhappy about, but it does not sting or burn me whatsoever. It feels very mild and nice on my face. Everybody was raving about the smell, so I was surprised when I opened it and realized that the smell is kind of like a grandmother's perfume. It's not a bad smell at all, though. The cream takes my make-up off nicely, even tough liquid liner. I was really surprised by how small the jar actually is, but after using it I realized that this stuff will last me forever. You only need a very small amount to do the trick. Overall, I'd recommend this to anybody!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I use this after I wash my face and before I put on makeup.  I use it morning & night in the winter, and at night in the summer, on my face and neck.  It does not take much at all to cover a lot of area. One container lasts me forever!  My brother even uses this in the winter when his skin gets so dry.This doesn't clog my acne-prone pores at all! And works wonders very quickly! (I like to think it also helps me avoid wrinkles!- I haven't gotten any yet!) This moisturizes without that greasy feeling some products can leave you with.  I highly recommend this!1smileycat :-)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have extremely dry skin...if I scratch my face in certain areas, like around my nose, skin flakes off, it's so dry. So of course I've tried every kind of moisturizer out there. This has worked the best for me. You only need a littlebit, I put it on and my face stays moisturized all day without my skin soaking it up and drying right back out. But it's definitely only for dry skin. Other people will say its greasy, but if your skin is truly dry like mine, It'll soak it right up and stay moisturized and it won't look greasy."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I tried this product while looking for a replacement for the Neutrogena Visibly Firm lotion that has now apparently been discontinued.  I am NOT impressed.  It reeks of \"that sunscreen smell\" and leaves my face feeling greasy for hours.  It does not work well under makeup - the face ends up with a somewhat smeary look, similar to the look you get on a hot day when you've been sweating buckets.  Additionally, it causes a very uncomfortable burning sensation if you get even the tiniest bit in an eye.I now only apply this product on my neck and d&eacute;colletage. While it does seem to work pretty well as a moisturizer, I will not be purchasing any more when the two-pack has been used up.Disappointing."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have dry, sensitive skin. I've tried a number of cleansers like this one (Cetaphil, Ponds cold cream, Boots cleansing lotion, etc.) and this one seems to work the best. It takes make up off well and doesn't leave behind a 'filmy' feeling if you just wipe off.  If you do rinse with water, it doesn't leave you with a tight, squeeky-clean feeling. It really does leave your skin feeling moisturized and yet cleanses enough to get rid of the dirt and make-up!  I'm very happy with this cleanser and will purchase again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Okay - I agree with others that this face wash can be drying.  I would not use it.  However, my husband swears by it and I see his results.  He has been cursed with horrible problem skin that can have bad cystic acne breakouts even though he is in his fifties.  If he goes even a few days without using Deep Clean he will begin breaking out.  He is a firefighter and is usually very good about bringing all of his grooming items when he works a 24 or 48-hour shift.  Occasionally he forgets an item.  If this is the item , you can tell even if he had to use a different product for as little as one day.I have to believe what I see and his testimonial."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love love love this cleanser!!! I'm changing products all the time to see if I find a better fit, but I always come back to this cleanser! It feels sooo good on my combination acne prone skin. It doesn't dry it out, however I can feel it cleanses very well. I like to leave it on as a mask during the time I brush my teeth (about 5 min or so), then when I rinse it off my skin feels amazing, there's a light tingling feeling and incredible deep clean sensation! They say it contains beta hydroxy, so I'm guessing it's acting a little kind of like very light peeling, refreshing your complexion every time..."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Men...if you have large pores that get clogged up this is for you.  I started using this two months ago.  It will keep your pores clean and open.  After just one month I found that the pores on my nose were staying open and actually seemed to be slowly diminishing in size.  I have this as one of my many subscribe and save items... so I know it will be a good price and I know it will arrive with all my other sub/saves on the 1st of every month."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't use this often but when I do it feels great to my skin.  It cleans well, removes oil and dirt.  I like how does not cause that overdrying feeling once it dries.  It also seems to have a cooling aid too so if I happen to clean to harshly I won't tell.  For those who wear makeup from my understanding it's a good at removing it before bedtime.  This does cost a few bucks more than its competition Noxzema -- I don't see a big difference besides you paying for the name.  Nevertheless pretty good facial cleaner."}

{"label": 4, "raw": "I love this mascara! I have used it for several years and when I try other mascaras, I am never happy with them and I always come back to this one. I don't like waterproof mascara because it is so hard to get off and I feel like I pull eyelashes out when I try to get it off. This if perfect; it is truly a thickening mascara and makes your eyelashes look great! And it doesn't have to be black; even the brown looks great! I like that it's also hypoallergenic and that it conditions my lashes with aloe and vitamin B5. And even with the shipping the cost was less than if I bought it in a store...and it's delivered right to my door!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My wife likes this mascara as it thickens and lengthens without clumping. She has a favorite mascara and this one is as good as it is. She also likes that it is washable and easily removed.She doesn't care for the brush as much as others she has tried but she can live with it. One issue that frustrates her though is that the brush is short and it cannot reach the bottom of the tube and she feels that you cannot use all of the mascara that is available.She rates this at 5 stars and would buy it again. I have posted a photo for your information."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have used both the moisturizing and the oil-free version of this makeup remover. Now, I will only rebuy the moisturizing one. The oil-free one was terrible.I can deal with having a bit of oil around my eyes after removing makeup, especially if it is moisturizing the area like it says it does. I end up going to sleep anyway after removing makeup, so it isn't a big deal. The formula is extremely gentle and it does its job without irritating the eyes. And if you don't want the oil around your eyes after removing the makeup, just take a towel and wipe it off. It is not a big deal.The oil-free one, on the other hand, irritated my eyes to no end! I couldn't even finish the container. My eyes became really red and bloodshot and I just couldn't keep using them. I am going to throw these out and re-buy the moisturizing ones."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this because it was on the top ten colognes for men on some site i went too on google. Anyways, it smells really great and lasts all day. I work in a corporate office and its 8 hour days and this scent lasts well pass the time i get home. Warning: you dont need a lot of sprays for this, a few well placed squirts around the neck and the wrists and your good to go. I recommend this, it came well before the estimated delivery time, nothing was tampered with and it smells really great. Get this fragrance and smell like a BOSS!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Early in my married days we were living, well let's call it, a low-income life. With a baby on the way I picked up another (lower-cost) brand. The sticks were harder and the cotton wasn't nearly as puffy and soft.All I can say is that on this item you CAN tell the difference!So in my house we always carry the Q-tips brand of cotton swabs and I must admit we also use a decent (and soft) toilet paper as well.Some things just aren't worth skimping on no matter how tight your budget."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "There's a reason why these guys have been around for years.  Their quality and price have made them the best value there is for cotton swabs.  They do the job, however interesting that that may be, and come back for more.  They're indispensable if you have a baby or young children, but they grow with you into adulthood as well.  There's some things you shouldn't buy the generic and this is one of them.  They've been around for years and for good reason - they're great!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The cotton on these unravels every single time I use them! I didn't have any troubles with the stick bending etc, but the cotton issue is terrible!! I bought these since they were on sale so cheap - 2 bucks - but now I regret it.I usually buy generic ones at the Dollar Tree, for a dollar of course, and those work perfectly well and NEVER unravel on me. I figured for the price, I'd buy these QTip brand, but boy was that a mistake. I can't even believe these things are so poor in quality, but yet the price is premium. Ripoff."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very dark brown hair and for some reason it took me a while to learn that these feria blacks are just not good for your hair. not only does it strip my color out of my hair (my hair starts turning medium brown in spots after a week of this product) but my hair absolutely feels awful (course, dry, brittle) immediately after usage. loreals \"last through 28 shampoos\" creme gloss product is longer lasting than this so called permanent hair color. I think this crap needs to be taken off the shelves and they need to try again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This color is so bold and edgy, it is fantastically vampy. The color has blue undertones, which I learned after dying it over a few errant bleached blonde strands. This color does fade very quickly, and it should be noted that there is nothing natural looking about this color. L'Oreal Paris Feria has several natural looking shades of black--but this is NOT one of them. This color is simply too shiny and far too stark to be considered \"au natural\". Fortunately for me I was craving something more dramatic and quasi scene-looking. I'd recommend this for anyone desiring an edgy look. For those just wanting to touch up on dark strands--seek another product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Bought this product at walmart for $10...  waste of money!!  I am mosltly platinum and had a few yellow tones and brassy streaks that I wanted toned out..  I've used feria before but just the darker brown colors.  It did tone out the yellow.. not so much the brass though....  the damage is horrid!!  It feels like it did the first day a bleached it from black..  save your money and your hair and go to sally's and get a quality lightening cream."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'd been messing around with lighter shades of red for about a year before I came across this color. I loved being a strawberry blonde, but the deeper, darker reds always intrigued me. So, I picked this up at Target. I wanna say it was the same price as on here.. At first, I thought it was too outrageous. I don't want to attract attention everywhere I go. But then I started getting compliments. I mean, everywhere I went. I had people tell me it was the prettiest hair color they'd ever seen. And I have to say I agree with them!The only downside is that it didn't seem to last as long as I'd hoped. I use a color depositing shampoo so I expected my results to last a tad bit longer. Either way, I'm happy dying my hair every day if that's what it takes to keep my hair this beautiful!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bleached my hair to a mostly yellow, slightly orange color and then applied this product to take it to the next level, to the color I wanted my hair to be. Instead, my hair is yellow-blond. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice color, just not the one I was hoping for. For that reason, I would say it's not worth the time or money. However, I gave it 2 stars because the conditioner it comes with is FANTASTIC! It's a nice purple anti-brass conditioner that works like a miracle at toning brassiness (to some degree anyway...)and leaves your hair feeling healthy and smelling like heaven. But other than that, I'm disappointed with my result and I'm sure it's human error to some degree but I wasn't that far off and expected the tone of my hair to cool somewhat to be closer to what was on the package. Will not purchase again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My hair was already platinum and I was simply trying to get the last of the extremely faint neon-ish banana yellow out, as my toners were not doing the trick and I did not want to bleach again.  I thought for sure this would do it, as it was really only ONE LEVEL to lift and this dye promises seven.  My hair STILL came out with yellow in it.  It's a VERY THICK substance and even with my extremely short and thin hair, I think it may have worked better if I had purchased 3-4...however at that point I may as well go to a salon or just bleach it again, it'd be cheaper and end in better results.  Basically, unless you are already an extreme platinum, this dye will not make your hair the colour on the box.  Furthermore, my dark blonde roots turned out neon orange."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used the cool medium brown color and it's awful! I have medium brown hair and always use a medium ash brown color on it. That usually takes it 1-2 shades darker than my natural color. I thought Feria looked interesting because of the highlights. Well, it's trashed my hair. My roots are oddly lighter than the rest of my hair (lighter than my natural color)and the grey hairs didn't take the color AT ALL! So, now I have this weird looking hair color AND still have greys. I'll never use this hair color again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love the L'oreal Feria color line and this is proof why I do. Every color I have used by them has been wonderful! I had Honey Brown hair and wanted a change. I didn't want a black with a blue base tone or a violet base tone, I just wanted black. My hair now is very black, shiny, healthy looking, and vibrant. It is kind of messy with the application (but what hair color process isn't?) I knew what to expect though since I use Feria quite often but someone who is trying it out for the first time might be surprised. My only advice is, use a towel. Fabulous product and the results are what I wanted."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't like spending a lot of money and I don't like going to get my hair done. Over the years I try to save money by buying the cheaper boxes but my hair never turns out the way I want it to. When I use Feria it comes out exactly how I want it each time. I also love that it's pretty much the only box that gives out true highlights. It's amazing. Other plus about Feria is that it comes with a lot of actual product. Meaning if you have long hair you only need to buy one box! In the end it's just better to spend a couple more dollars to make yourself look great. I've never had a problem with any Feria hair colors. I love it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Don't bother! What a waste of time. On the side of the box it states what color your hair will turn out based on the color of your hair. My hair is dark brown/ black.  The turnout color would be a bright intense red, exactly what I wanted. What color did my hair come out? Dark brown/ black with a hint of red in the sunlight. Nothing like it states on the side of the box.  I pursed this product over another based on the color chart and spent extra to get it.  Won't ever buy from L'Oreal again!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The reason why it scared me is because this is my first time dying my hair and once my hair dried, it didn't look at all like the color. My hair looked like my natural color only with pink blotches here and there. I went to bed and the next day my hair color looked a little better and my hope was restored. I took a shower and noticed the water going down the drain was pink and I assumed the color was still washing out. When my hair dried this time, the color changed again! Now I'm watching my hair color as the days pass and it seems as if the color is still adjusting to the color on the box. So if you experience the same thing I am, don't panic. The color comes in eventually."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this for years, and it's a must-have for helping to keep my heap of curls controlled and conditioned. I use a little every night after I shower and occasionally in the morning, and it really helps to keep my curly hair from tangling and the ends from splitting/frizzing. It also has a pleasant, light scent, and it's a good deal price-wise compared to other leave-in conditioners (many of which I've tried and not been nearly as impressed with).The only drawback is that I have very thick hair and thus go through a bottle of this in a month -- I wish it went a little further. Still, for the price it's hard to beat."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have not been able to find this conditioner anywhere until I spotted it on Amazon. Because it's a spray mist, it's much easier to control where and how much I want to apply, which I like because my hair is fine and most bottled conditioners weigh it down, even after ample rinsing.  This spray also enhances the highlights in my hair - I don't know why since it's not meant to do that, but I don't mind. The scent is wonderful and light. I purchased a 3/pk for about $11 with free Prime shipping so for now, I'm a happy camper!  Thanks again Amazon....."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Never tried this brand before, I have super damaged hair from recently going from red to pink to platinum to black, this helps as a detangler,  though I don't think is actually doing anything to long term improve my damaged hair (I don't think any product would though). What I like most is it doesn't make my hair oily or greasy and I can still go 2 days between washings without getting the greasy look a lot of leave in products have over time. I give 3 stars because I'm just not wowed, still looking for something that will actually help repair my hair. As just a detangler it would be a 5 though."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very dry, thick, coarse, curly hair. Was skeptical about this product because of the cheap price, but I had used Aussie products years ago, and thought I'd try it.

I then also use a conditioning balm, and sometimes a bit of gel. I find that I can \"refresh\" my curls the second day after shampooing with this product and it looks great. No bed head!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought a bottle of this a few years ago and it had tea tree in it and it was absolutely amazing stuff and really great for my itchy scalp. My hair never looked better. Now, they've replaced the tea tree with aloe and it now has a better pina colada type smell. Delicious, summery smell, by the way. Without the tea tree, the product is not as good as it used to be, but I will continue using it because the ingredient list is top notch and the smell is so yummy. There's really no need to spend more money buying salon products when you can get stuff that's just as good or better for a fraction of the cost. One bottle of this is $2.50 at my local Wal-mart. You can't beat that!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "this review does not address how well the product works or not because I only tried this out one day as a stand alone for the follwoing reasons:The scent of this is reminds me of the beach, sunscreen, or a tanning bed.  Since I don't live/work near a beach or have a need to wear sunscreen all day or smell like coconut I choose not to use this daily by itself.On to condition weight:  it's a light condition the doesn't weigh your hair down or make it appear oily in any way. On the negative I have very prone to frizzy hair and this doesn't help with that at all.Because I can't just use this product by itself due to the reason above, I will not review this any further."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product smells great. It has a coconut/beachy/light smell that fades so it is not overpowering at all. I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner, then spray it on my dry hair and comb thru. It leaves my hair super soft and smooth. I even used it a day after washing my hair when I woke in the morning to smooth out bed head. It does not leave your hair greasy or weighed down at all. Not sure how that is possible but I love it. I have atomic pink hair and it does not fade my color."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo is great for removing build up.  I use it weekly because my dandruff shampoo builds up after a while; my friend uses it daily because the many styling products she uses leave her hair looking dull.The bottle says for \"normal to oily\" hair, but my hair is dry and I've never had an issue with it drying out my scalp.This has to be the best bargain shampoo in the world.  If I didn't suffer from dandruff I would use it only a daily basis."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price.  It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this, I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless.  When I got home, I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product.  I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original, almost-odorless formula."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am an African-American woman with 4a hair. I gave this shampoo a perfect score because it thoroughly cleaned my hair and scalp with drying it out or stripping it. My hair has low porosity so it can easily collect build up. It is important for the health of my hair to keep it as clean as possible. I use it about once a month. I also love the price. I bought it at Walgreens for only 75 cents. I was surprised that such a cheap product could work so well. I recommend this product to anyone with any hair type. I'm sure this product will work just as well with naturally straight hair. I am definitely going to use more products from this brand in the future."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This review is from: Suave Naturals Shampoo, Daily Clarifying 15ozThis shampoo does clean the hair, but it leaves thinning hair blowzy and dry. It does not moisturize in the least. There is a scent to the shampoo, too, which, while slightly feminine isn't potent and clinging, surprises this consumer because this shampoo is advertised as hypo-allergenic. Scents do cause allergic reactions in certain people, as Amazon reviewers here attest. The scent doesn't cause me any allergic responses like headaches.What bothers me is that though this shampoo is for normal to oily hair, it strips the hair of all oil, leaving it clean but very dry.  Only a good conditioner can remedy the problem this shampoo causes. Also, this product contains the infamous lathering carcinogen, sodium laureate sulfate."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "About the time my son turned four Johnson's baby shampoo - a household staple - began to fail us.  It wasn't getting his and his older sister's hair clean and so I set about to find a replacement.  Suave's Strawberry shampoo was it.This shampoo gets their hair clean and leaves it smelling nice.  In addition it works fine as a body wash, which means that I can clean the entirety of their sweaty, mud splattered little bodies with one product.  After using it for over a year, I can say that I've found no downside.  It doesn't dry out their skin or hair, and it's affordable.Four Stars.  Very Good Shampoo.  Smells nice and cleans well.  We use it as a body wash and it doesn't dry out or irritate my children's sensitive skin.Pam T~"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm 75 years old, and I've been applying this gel every night for the past five or six years.  There's no way of knowing if the wrinkles would be worse without it, but I think it's helping, and it feels so wonderful when I apply it before getting into bed at night.The jar doesn't hold too much, but you use very little with each application.  And the 2-Pack is more economical than buying one at a time at a retail store.A good product at a fair price."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this stuff for years. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT ! It sets my foundation great.. & is even great without foundation & still has great coverage! I also use it for touch ups.. A LOT! It lasts quite awhile & doesn't feel heavy or cakey at all. I definitely recommend for someone who is looking for something that is JUST as good as high end powders! The only downside is the powder puff it comes with falls apart VERY easily. I bought my last compact just 3 weeks ago & its completely falling apart! But it's an easy fix because I just use my blush brush to apply it for touch ups. Just wish it came with a better quality puff. It's worth it though for the LOW PRICE! I just recommend tossing the puff & buying a better quality one that can be washed over & over or simply by using a powder/blush brush. Other than that I love this stuff!!"}

No itchiness, no irritation, no blurred vision (obvs don't rub it into your eyeballs) and i always rinse it off. its also convenient which is the No.1 thing for me. I love Maybelline so yeah, not bad"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My wife is writing this review for me:  I have tried all different eye makeup removers, either they are greasy or don't remove enough eye makeup or leave mascara behind.  This Maybelline remover works so very well, removes all of my makeup, doesn't leave my eyes greasy or leave remnants of mascara behind.  It even removes waterproof mascara.  I used Lancome for a while, and honestly, this works better and is so much less expensive.  Everyone should at least try it before buying expensive brands."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I went on a product-kick to find solutions for my super oily face and this is my favorite product I've found. I also bought de-slick spray from Urban Decay and Basis face wash but haven't noticed a big difference from either of those (Urban Decay's complexion prep spray is much better than the de-slick spray, FYI).This product REALLY cuts down on my oil issues! You can wear it alone for some light coverage and to feel clean when lounging around or wear it over/under makeup to stay looking matte much longer. If you've got super oily skin, you need this. Don't expect all your problems to be solved.. you'll still need oil blotting sheets and your usual methods, but I find this to be a big help. For under $5, you can't go wrong!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Maybelline Volum' Express Mascara is so much better than Great Lash.  It goes on evenly and lengthens without clumping.I always use my mascara long past the three month suggested shelf life and it doesn't get dried out very quickly.  (However using mascara after six months puts the user at a risk of infection, so be warned.)And it really is waterproof.  You'll need a reliable mascara remover if you want it to come off your lashes.  I've sat through tear-jerkers wearing Volum' Express and come out without a smudge (much less racoon eyes!)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the best bang for your buck when it comes to inexpensive mascaras. It definitely gives lashes dramatic volume but in a way that draws attention to your eyes and not your makeup. It doesn't clump at all, and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes. My only complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to remove...but it's a waterproof mascara. It's supposed to be long lasting! When I shower and wash my face each night it will not budge. It doesn't bother me, but if you are someone who must remove every speck before bedtime, this is not for you!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I guess the coverage is ok, but I don't like the texture.  It doesn't feel creamy and glide on like I want it to.  It has a dry feel to it during application, but your skin doesn't look dry after you apply it.  As I'm applying it, it dries up too quickly, and then I have to get more from the bottle.  A little does not go a long way and I have to really rub to get it on.  It also looks streaky after I'm done.  It's hard to explain, but I just don't like it.  I prefer cover girl."}

I take any lip liner and outline my lips, and hen fill in the sides. Then I take this lipstick and put it on the center of my pout. Then I smush them together, and I have a nicely faded ombre lip. I get compliments every time. I have found that my ombre lip works BESTEST ;) with this lipstick. I've tried it with mac ones and its never as good! This lipstick is a staple in  my collection. Very quick shipping !"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I recently bought two gorgeous colors of Revlon lipstick: Fabulous Fig and Highbeam Tan. I was pleased to discover that the Fabulous Fig rates surprisingly safe on the EWG Skindeep site, but the Highbeam Tan has a poor score and is full of parabens and other junk. It's too bad, because Highbeam Tan is such a fantastic color. I wish companies like Revlon would clean up the ingredients in their products. It isn't that hard, or that expensive, to make lipstick that contains safer ingredients. The Fabulous Fig vs. the Highbeam Tan is a perfect example of this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this for my mom who loves the color. She wants me to get a couple more because she's wants backups.I tried it several times and I would say the formula is VERY good for a lipstick at this price point. It doesn't last amazingly long and isn't as AMAZING as some of the more expensive lipsticks I own (Estee Lauder, Mac). But the difference in price is HUGE. And if you're okay with several touch ups in the day, it makes a good every day lipstick."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I read the rave reviews about using it for years through many generations and the benefits of using it. I am in my early 50's so I wanted to get rid of forehead wrinkles and facial lines. I think I got better results in Ponds. This rich cream may need to sit on the face at night but I don't do night creams-messy. It seems it blends in nicely with a little moderate rubbing but I just didn't notice much difference in my apperance. It's just ok with me not bad and not great."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have tried almost every conditioner on the market and found that most are too rich and weigh my hair down or they don't moisturize enough and left a rat's nest out of my hair.  Of course the superexpensive (Fekkai) ones work great but I get tired of paying that much money all the time. I was very pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked PERFECT. My hair felt conditioned but it was not weighed down and it had some body. This has a very light, pleasant scent. I highly recommend this to anyone just to try and see and at this price its not an investment."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This soap is just ok; it sort of makes my skin feel a bit like it has a film on it or something, but perhaps I just need to get used to it.  I quit using sulphate soaps, and I use this or Dr. Bronner's Tea Tree Oil soap.UPDATE: I really love this soap, and my skin loves it too.  I have VERY sensitive skin, and I can't even use soap with a wash cloth, because I will itch when I get out of the shower if I do.  I really like how delicate this soap is on my skin.  I slather my arms and legs in coconut oil after the shower, and my skin has no irritation at all.  I will probably use this soap forever, as it cleans, but it doesn't make my skin angry.  The bar also lasts FOREVER; I have been using it everyday now for several months, and it's only halfway gone.  Great deal for the money :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I feel the need to write a review of this product mainly because of all the reviews saying its caustic.First let me say I am a soap maker and run a very successful business making cold process soap. Sometimes I don't get a batch made for myself and I have to buy some,so this was convenient and I bought it even after reading some of the terrible reviews. I have several means of testing soap for caustics I used every single one on this bar before using it on my skin,this soap is in NO way caustic! It's a pretty nice basic soap, a large bar, and came at a good price.When I neglect to have soap made for personal use I will definately purchase this product again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've bought this before at the drugstore and used it until it was gone.  The smell is light, the formula is light; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.Problem is, either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch.  Now, even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face, using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser, I get this weird greasy feeling all over.  Shortly after that is what I call \"the water stage,\" where as if by magic, my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top.  I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel, because it looks like I've worked up a sincere sweat.  I don't know what's wrong with this product, and I'm holding onto it to try in the dry winter months, but I'm not optimistic.  At this point, I would not order it again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is more thin than I thought it would be. I guess I was expecting Pond's thickness, but I didn't want to buy Ponds which is a little greasy for me. Hydra Renewal smells so nice and feels good going on. It doesn't go on oily and soaks into my skin well. I have no problems using it on my face, around my eyes and neck area. I have had no problems applying sunscreen directly after and didn't end up with a greasy mess on my face.  I like the price, too, which is affordable. This product is available at Walmart, as well."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've only been using the product for a week morning and night and can say that it works for its intended purpose that I got it for. Within two days I saw drastically reduced puffiness and after four the dark circles were diminished enough that I felt okay without makeup to cover my severe dark circles.Granted, they are still there a little, but it has only been a week. All in all, I say it works pretty well considering I didn't really have high expectations at all. I'll wait and see if it holds up over time.I don't have any wrinkles around my eyes yet so I can't speak for that part, but maybe it'll help keep them away."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I agree with the reviewer below me..I have used nothing else but this product for over 15 yrs. I have tried so many $$$$$$$$$$$ nothing works better than this.Some products are much too aggressive for the eye area.Having very sensitive skin/eyes, everything I have ever tried irritates my eyes, or is to heavy & greasy.This removes the dark circles, feels extremely cool when applying, is not greasy, but moisturizes & keeps those lines in control .I use it morning & night, can be put in fridge also for hour or (2) before if your eyes are puffy, works wonderfully for that !It's perfect, I hope it never gets discontinued I would be lost without it.Thanks"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this for a few months now and this just moisturizes. For reference, I have normal, slightly oily lids. My eye area is incredibly sensitive to retinol. I have really dark circles, mostly due to genetics.Pros:-my skin has not reacted negatively to this product-first ingredient is water, making this a good starter moisturizer for beginners-does not sting or bother my eyes much if I accidentally get some in-affordableCons:-does not get rid of dark circles. There is white shimmer in this gel, which will reflect light making it seem like your dark circles are lighter.-does not get rid/fill in fine lines.-dries tacky. I've varied the amount I put on and there's still a tacky residue through out the day. Might be good for those who use makeup.Although I wouldn't buy this again, I would definitely recommend this product to those just starting out with eye creams. Also, this seems like it will last me a long time. I do use this twice a day."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was so hopeful about these. I wanted an alternative to tampons that was healthy and environmentally-friendly (and cheaper!) So I was excited to try them. But it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I don't want to get into vivid details. But basically, I was not warned that this would be such a MESSY ordeal. Not to mention it's not at all convenient. I do not want to leave it in for too long, because if I do, I know it's not absorbing any fluid, so I worry about leakage, or the horrible mess that it will make all over my hands when I try to take it out. GROSS! Also, the thing itself is absolutely huge. I imagine most people would look at it and be terrified to try to put it in their bodies. I believe there was a reason tampons became so much more popular than these methods. Sorry, but I've got to switch back."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm prone to yeast infections, so I try to avoid tampons, which can be irritating.  I've tried two different brands of menstrual cups, both of which were a challenge to remove!  With Softcup, they're super easy to insert and remove.  And while they're not reusable like menstrual cups, they hold just as much and, frankly, I don't want to bother having to wash one.  The fact that they're disposable make them really convenient.  Once they're in, I can't feel them at all, and they don't press on my urethra like menstrual cups do, so it's no problem to pee with them in.  I've worn these on an off for years and have never had any problems with leaking either."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had been using the DivaCup for a while and had a lot of success with it, but when I lost it a friend  gave me a pack of the softcups she had used once and didn't like. I thought since I had liked the other brand this would be much the same way... it wasn't I don't know how many times I tried to readjust things and try different angles or higher/lower inside the vaginal walls, I couldn't stop the cup from leaking. It wasn't horrible, but it was enough to ruin a couple of pairs of panties which ensured that I wasn't saving money on this alternative item and that I won't be using the brand again. It was an utter disappointment... I'd say try another brand instead like DivaCup or Lunette, I had good experiences with both."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this cleanser since my late teens. It is one of the best OTC acne medicines available, and slightly cheaper than other drugstore cleansers like Neutrogena. When used twice a day, the Clean and Clear greatly reduces the number of pimples I get. Also, it contains menthol, so it feels pleasantly tingly on skin (but do not get it into your eyes; it burns like the flames of he11!). There are only two drawbacks to this product: 1) It will dry out your skin, so wear a lotion and 2) The active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is a bleaching agent, so it will bleach fabric. I recommend using old wash cloths to wash your face and be very careful not to get it on your clothes."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this for about 6 months. Before I had been using Proactive. Proactive worked great for me for a while but eventually stopped clearing up my skin so I switched to Clean and Clear Continuous Control. My skin cleared right up and stays clear other than whiteheads. The only problem is that it's a little harsh on my skin. Usually irritates it if I leave it on but for a second. It also dries out my skin a lot. So I use it every other day. I get a couple pimples by using it every other day but it is still better than Proactive and AcneFree."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I will admit -- I do feel this product was helping reduce my acne. However, I developed a really nasty yeast infection about two weeks in (sorry to be gross but want to give an honest review) and I also noticed a weird stinging sensation in my lower abdomen. I did some online searching and noticed some people say they develop gastro issues with this product. I didn't add anything else new to my routine and haven't had a yeast infection in years. May be totally un-related but once I stopped the product, my stomach issues stopped. I think this is a good product, but for me, the side effects were not worth it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've only recently started incorporating toner into my facial cleansing program, but this is my favorite that I've tried so far. This toner leaves my face feeling very clean, yet soft (not tight or itchy), plus it has the benefits of an Alpha and Beta hydroxy. It really does help keep my pores cleaner, and therefore smaller over time. I find it to be perfect for my combination/oily skin, but for those with dry or sensitive skin the alcohol might be irritating or overly drying."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I washed my face with this once yesterday, and once the day before and yesterday in the evening, a good portion of the right side of my face and a few under my chin broke out in ugly hives! It itches horribly and it really hurts. To make matters worse, I had to go to work looking like this. I didn't want to put on makeup that would irritate my skin so I was forced to leave the house looking like a pepperoni pizza. :(And also, when I was washing my face with this, I noticed that the scrubbing beads in this were SCRATCHING my face. Not a comfortable exfoliation, but like sandpaper. And this cleanser has a very noticeable chemical smell to it. I wish that I had never wasted my money on this product, and I wish that I had never put this on my face!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I use this approximately every other day due to the drying it causes but after a week or so, my pores were visibly reduced, not gone just not as noticeable. Just a splash on a cotton square and I go in upwards motions after my morning face wash and before I moisturize. I will continue to use but will not use everyday as my skin is prone to dryness. It worked in all areas of my face, my nose and forehead were most noticeable to me and now they are much smaller. Recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to reduce size of large pores."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My skin is pretty oily and the pores are larger than I'd like. After using this cleanser for 3 months or so, I do notice a difference.Texture was what I picked up on the first time I used it. It is pretty thick, and the beads are definitely micro. It didn't feel real grainy, which I liked. A little goes a long way, and since this tube is so big it should last a while. I haven't even used a quarter of mine yet.I use this along with Origins Zero Oil Moisturizer and Origins Clear Improvements Charcoal Mask. I found them to be pretty effective at making my pores look smaller, cleaner and less overall oil production. It has a really good price point. Many a department store cleansers can cost 3-4X as much.It does work over time, so don't expect to see much difference in the beginning. I will buy it again and continue my routine. I've seen good improvement in the last few months."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried other astringents, and this one is the perfect balance of effective cleansing without overdrying.  Those who use this product alone probably do not get great results, but this is designed to be part of a skincare regimen, including moisturizing.  I use a mild face wash, then I use this astringent to help remove any makeup that did not get removed by the face wash (makeup remover gives me breakouts).  After that, I use Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish lotion.  It's a very simple regimen, but extremely effective.  I've tried other astringents in the same regimen, but they dried out my skin and had noticeably higher alcohol content, likely the cause of the over-drying."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am 21 and have had combo skin for years and years, dry in the morning, oily throughout the day! i love this product though! i use it on my face every morning when my skin is a bit flakey, and it makes my skin so soft! my moisturizer goes on smoothly finally! a bottle lasts a long time, i very rarely break out, and i have noticed a significant difference in the amount of oil on my face at the end of the day! i still have some but much less! my only complaint is that it does nothing for blackheads, i still have those..."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is an excellent astringent, I had my doubts with products touting  \"oil eliminating\", \"oil free\" as they never seemed to work. This product does exactly what it's supposed to. The smell is similar to theNeutrogena Clear Pore Scruband it does not burn like some astringents do. I follow this with theNeutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30in the morning. I consider this product my \"holy grail\" in my skin care regimen. I kills the bacteria without killing my skin cells. It's an excellent product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I use Neutrogena Body Clear in lieu of other shower gel or soap rather than in combination with it. One thing I like about it is it takes much less of this scrub to be as effective as larger quantities some other body washes I've used - one bottle lasts several months for me. It is also much harder to squeeze out of the bottle. Once you get down to the end of the bottle, you have to pry off the cap to get it out - not exactly convenient. The odor is a little bit too sterile for my tastes, but it seems effective as an exfoliator and leaves me feeling clean. While it hasn't really combatted my minor body acne/KP that I can tell, it has kept it under control. I haven't found anything better in effectiveness or bang-for-buck in terms of shower gel or bar soap. I recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am a hormonally challenged female and have been suffering from bacne lately, though it isn't typical. I decided to go ahead and try this body wash to see if it would help. What do you know -- just a day later and it was working quite well! I still have little blackheads, but no more big, really noticeable zits. I combined it with a really great exfoliating loofah and the skin on my back has gotten much better. It does smell pretty gross though - my husband thought he smelled something rank this morning in the shower, but I told him it was probably the body wash and when he sniffed it he confirmed. If you can deal with the smelliness while you're washing then it's worth it. I don't find that it leaves a residual smell at all."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have had a really  hard time finding an acne cleaning body wash that I like. They either smell terrible or leave my skin feeling filmy. For me this is the second best smelling one out there. It could, however, do without the silly little pink beads in the soap.I prefer Neutrogena's Stress Control Body Wash for scent but I have a hard time finding it. It seems to be gentler as well. This, however, is really the only substitution if you can't find the Stress one."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this product for several years, and I love it. It smalles wonderful, it rinses clean, unlike some other body washes that I've used that leave residue. It's also not too drying, which is good, because my skin dries out really easily.During the summer, though, I tend to get blemishes on my shoulders and chest, and I've switched to the Neutrogena Body Scrub, which I find deals with acne a little better. It comes in an identical bottle to this, and has some exfoliating beads in it as well. If you don't have to wory about bodily acne, this is a great product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this wash for years since I have sensitive skins and my back breaks out bad.  I use to use the regular wash but when the grapefruit scent came out, I've been hooked.  I love the fresh scent of grapefruit which is a great smell to help wake you up in the shower in the morning.  Also, as I've been using Neutrogena since I was a teenager (like 15 years now)...I am a huge fan of this wash and works great!  I rarely break out and I attribute it to Neutrogena.  The price on Amazon is comparatively priced to my local box stores but I have Prime so it's a nice now to able to buy and have shipped directly to my house without having to make a special trip to the boxed stores.  Thanks Amazon!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very acne prone skin, so I thought if I used this it would help my skin.  Maybe it has and my skin would be much worse without it.  But, I use this everyday and I still have a decent amount of acne.  Maybe it is stress?  I don't know.  I use it on a loofa puff.  Maybe if you use it on a washcloth it would be better?  I don't know.  I usually have really good luck with Neutrogena items, so I am giving this three stars, assuming it will work better for other skin.  Plus I am 40, and my hormones are much different than a teenager that might be the target group for this item."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this product a while ago, and I was so happy with the outcome. After a couple weeks of using it my scalp was no longer itchy (at all) and the flakes went away. It also has a very nice scent. Although it does leave my hair a bit dry, you just need to use a good conditioner and you're all set. I ran out and I had some head & shoulders stored so I used that. Head & Shoulders really sucks compared to the Jason brand. Once my Head & Shoulders is all gone I am going to go back to Jason and stick with it! It works so great."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My husband and I both use this shampoo - he for light dandruff control, and me just because I like the way it cleans my fine hair.  It is paraben-free, and does not contain sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates.  The scent is not as refreshing as the scent of Jason Natural Cosmetics - Satin Shower Body Wash/Tea Tree Oil 30 fl oz Gel, which is a fabulous body wash, but it is not a bad scent.  You do need to watch that it doesn't get in your eyes, since tea tree oil can sting a bit."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Not really smelling anything but \"Baby Powder\" when using this, but I love Baby Powder smell, so this is not a issue for me. I give it a 4 star rating due to the miss-leading name. I do love this Body Wash, it lathers really well when used with a scrunchy, but not with a wash cloth what so ever.The bottle size is impressive and can easily leave a family of 4 1 to 1.5 months. I feel like my skin is already starting to appreciate the \"All Natural\" effect of this product. I will order this again, but in a different scent to try.The texture is very creamy & you do not need a lot & it has the added bonus of the pump & the kids really think that is the coolest thing ever (4 & 5 yrs old)Definetly would recommend this product or any of Jason's Products to anyone looking for healthier skin/hair (yes they make shampoo & conditioner)."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Jason's natural products are exceptional. I love the body wash and this product tends to be more expensive in stores so that's why I purchase on amazon. If you like the smell of  lavender, this product  will tickle your fancy.  Very nice during shower time.  The soap feels great on your skin and nourishes because it contians Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5 and aloe vera. Jason's body washes are known for no or low sulfides which is good for sensitive skins and the main reason I purchase.  I think what I love the most about this product is the bottle dispenser.  It's so easy to use in the shower and never had a problem with clogging.  It despenses down to the bottom of the bottle.This is a prime product which is a plus too.  Multiple purchase customer and I'll be back again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have used Jason products for many years, mainly because they do not test on animals. I believe that is very important to many people. This body wash lasts a  long time, just one pump onto my fluffy wash thing, (I never know what they call those little round net things we have so many of), anyway, one pump is enough to supply a ton of foaming suds that make you feel so clean and it rinses off so easily. Leaves my skin soft and not dry. I am a great fan of this body wash because I do like tea tree oil for it's antiseptic properties,  and  I also buy the lavender one, for it's soothing effect. I alternate between the two of them.  It is a great bargin for the price considering how much body wash we use.  I think it would be good for a large family of kids because the Koala bear is just too cute."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My grandson was visiting recently, he has such bad eczema, I was desperate!! I had this soap for awhile, and thoughtit couldn't hurt to try. I'm so glad I did, he wasn't scratching/itching or crying( he's 18 months). I was DESPERATE, toget him some relief, I can't say enough GOOD things about this soap. Except left no residue, no itching afterwards andthe biggest reward: he slept through the night! God bless your soap! I will DEFINITELY be reordering!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I worked in cosmetic ingredient sales for several years meaning I sold the ingredients directly to large manufacturers and worked with the scientists.I learned much and try to share it.It's rare to find so many natural and beneficial ingrdients in a soap or face wash. This is a cleanser for oily skin according to the bottle front but it actually is surprisingly mild and non-drying. But the big bonus for me is the tea tree. This is a natural antiseptic and blemish cure yet having to dilute a bottle of it and then apply that mixture to skin isn't all that convenient. This does it for you so you not only have cleaner hands, but better skin on your face as well.How can it clean the skin with an antiseptic without drying it? It also contains olive oil, another great skin helper. So between the two you are cleaning, removing bacteria, as well as moisturizing.I have very sensitive skin and have had great results with this cleanser."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My first tube of retinol was purchased on Amazon and it was made by another company. I was not really experienced with using retinol but that product didn't really impress me. I decided due to financial reasons to change my skin care routine to something more affordable and I chose the Alpha Hydrox line. I'm happy with their line of products and the ResQ is so much better than what I was previously using. I do recommend this product as I have noticed a positive difference in my skin. Its smoother and softer now and I will continue to purchase and use the ResQ creme."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am 24 years old and was using this at night and lightly in the morning. I don't have any wrinkles or fine lines and was just using this for prevention. I loved the consistency and the fact that it has no smell. It helped to clear up some dry patches I had in the winter around my eyes and didn't break me out on the parts of my face near my eye area where this product touched. However, I had to discontinue use because I noticed that my vision was becoming blurred. I could still see, but I felt like I had a film over my eye that I couldn't get to clear. Once discontinuing, the problem went away. It is unfortunate because I really did like using this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The first time I used Avalon's Vitamin C eye cream, my eyes began to sting so badly that I was uncomfortable for 24 hours.  I thought that maybe I had used too much, so I tried again several days later with only a tiny amount, being careful to keep it away from my lashes.  My eyes still became uncomfortable. This is the exact opposite of what an eye cream should do.  The whole point of eye cream is to be thick enough not to melt and get into your eyes and, if it does, it should not sting. That's why eye cream is different than face cream. This one fails. I won't be using it again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Aside from my standard Olay ORIGINAL moisturizer which I use faithfully every day -- this seems to be the ONLY other product that helps the &#34;vertical&#34; lines that are appearing on the top of my eyelids.  I'm 67 and have tried a lot of products - found most to be rather useless for the money except for the Olay ORIGINAL mositurizer which I have used all my life and now this.  Nice touch before bed as well.  Smell is faint but good.  Very creamy.  Use just a tiny dab -- and the pump is nice in that it only puts out a very small amount - just what you need for the small eye space -- so no waste of product.I have also tried the facial cream from Avalon Organics Vit C  - like it, but this Revitalizing Eye Creme is the one that makes a visible difference on my lines above my eye with repeated daily use."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "- Tommy Hilfiger name brand. Some reviewers seem to think certain colognes have been not authentic, but anytime I buy from Amazon directly, shipped from and sold by Amazon, I have always gotten a retail packaged item.- Smells great, fresh, clean, and not overpowering.- Price is a little high for what I like to spend, but this is a good size supply that should last long enough to justify the price.- Overall I'm pleased with the product. Will I buy it again? Maybe. I like to try different colognes and also look at which happen to have  a lower price at the time I need to order, but if the price is right I'll likely try this cologne at least once more.- Amazon delivered quickly w Prime."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have used this with my last 2 pregnancies and have no stretch marks. Don't know if it's because of this oil, but I know it can't hurt! I love that this oil does not stain, however, I only use it at night under my tank tops that I wear to bed. This oil does have a slight cocoa smell, but it's not nauseating at all. I am easily turned off by strong odors, but it's so faint that I don't smell it for long. Would highly recommend!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I recently had a bad case of hives from an allergic reaction to a medicine.This product helped a lot in the short run, which was worth quite a bit. Cooling and soothing. However, I found that after a couple of applications over the course of half a day or so, the product buildup became an irritant in itself, and I had to shower and remove it, which I didn't necessarily feel well enough to want to do. I didn't have that problem with aloe vera gel.However, this product contains a mild local anesthetic, so it may be more helpful for some things. I didn't think of the aloe vera gel until the hives had improved somewhat, so it may not have compared as well in the beginning.I'd buy this again, but I sure hope I don't need to."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this mascara for years and it never disappoints. Adds lots of length and volume to my lashes. The first couple applications from a brand new tube are pretty thin and light, but it will thicken and give you the desired results thereafter. I used to go through these tubes so quickly because they would dry out pretty fast... until a trick I learned: if your tube starts drying out, extend its life by adding 2 drops of contact solution/eye drops to the tube. It will instantly rehydrate it for continued use. I've been using the same tube for 10 months now by doing this! :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "BEST mascara I've ever used.  I recently had been following the advice of some beauty bloggers and tried a couple other brands only to be disappointed by their clumping, or inability to give me long, beautiful looking lashes (mostly clumping - yuck).So I came back to my old favorite and it's just as good as ever.  This mascara goes on really well-- no clumping even if you slide the wand through your lashes a few times (for complete, awesome coverage).  It makes my eyes look great, doesn't smudge for me.  I have a friend who says she gets raccoon eyes from this-- so she uses their waterproof version and loves it.  So if you touch your eyes a lot or have allergies/watery eyes, maybe go waterproof.  I don't prefer waterproof because I like that this comes off easy with soap and water without need for a special makeup remover."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this based on the good reviews I read, and had confidence that it would live up to them. It didn't. This mascara smudges and smears very easily. It's allergy season, so my eyes tear a little... but just from that it streaked under my eyes! Other mascaras don't do this at all. The mascara goes on nicely and separates your lashes well, but I can't give it a three-star rating because I can't use it and had to throw it in the trash."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Why haven't I been singing the praises of this little beauty of a mascara?!  I get courted away by $30+ mascaras that flake or never wash off!  Even the drugstore brands lured me away with their fancy brushes and promises of butterfly lashes.  No more!  This stuff doesn't flake, is inky and black, but can be removed w gentle soap and water.  My lashes actually feel conditioned after using this for a few days.  Do yourself a favor and buy this!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This has to be one of the best mascaras I have ever tried (and I've tried many!).  My lashes are both thin and short, and I've found that this mascara adds plenty of fullness AND a bit of length, too.  Plus, there are absolutely NO CLUMPS when I use this mascara; the unique brush deposits just the right amount of product on my lashes, unlike other products that claim to be \"clump-free.\"  I've tried both the regular and the waterproof versions of this mascara; I prefer the latter, as it stays on great yet washes off easily.  The only thing that I think could make this product better would be a curling brush to give the lashes a bit more lift.  Although Full 'N Soft isn't a dramatic mascara, it is perfect for everyday wear, and I would recommend highly to anyone."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "i love this mascara, the brush and consistency work perfectly together to give a feathery fan of darkened lashes without looking like you obviously have mascara on, which when working in a professional setting is really important.  what i love most is i have to be a huge lash comb fiend with most mascaras to avoid the awful spikes look or worse, clumps. this mascara does neither, i don't have to comb at all and i'm always in a rush so saving a another tool and step is great.  probably not intense enough for night looks, but for day to day this is perfect."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "it doesn't wear well under make-up. It's just a little oily. Other than that...I love this product. I use it mainly on my neck and chest (and on my face on my days off) and it has evened out my skin tone and faded my sun-spots ALOT. Especially on my chest...HUGE difference from a few years ago! It really is a great All-in-One Product- I've been using it for years and haven't found a better one yet. I'll keep on buying it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "this is one of my tried and true beauty products; it never fails me. The other night, after using a different (and much more expensive) cream for over a month, I reverted back to using this, and my gosh, I fell in love all over again! I highly recommend this product. It's rich and gives the right amount of moisture without a greasy feel or look. Due to it not having SPF, I use this at night, and use a BB cream during the day."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Olay Total Effect's facial lotion is an excellent everyday lotion.  It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.  It has no fragrance and absorbs quickly.  The one issue I have is that it leaves me looking a bit shiny.The bottle that it comes in is small and travels well.  It's easy to pump out the exact amount that you need.I have combination sensitive skin and I've not noticed and issues or breakouts.  I've been using it for about a month now with good results."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Can't stand perfume and its in everything. ( Perfumed toilet paper is just strange!) This is great for me,doesn't take forever to be absorbed. I have it on auto ship. Sent to me every other month cause I have my husband use it too. He's had a lot of skin cancer on his face and this spf 15 is just enough for regular daily use. I use this in the morning and a heavier one at night. The dermatologist says my 65 year old skin looks great even with her magnifying glass. Lets keep it that way!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I just got Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free this week. I was worried because some reviewers said that they had bad reactions, and that it's not good if you have sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any bad reaction to this.I think the key is not to get the one with SPF. The people who had bad reactions bought the one with SPF. This fragrance free variety without SPF has not given me any problem so far. I am not happy that the product contains parabens though, so I won't buy it again for that reason.So, if you want to try Olay Total Effects, get the one that is fragrance free and does not have the SPF."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I applied this item as directed and it worked great everywhere -- except my cheeks, where it caused burning, irritation, and a very visible rash. My skin is not super sensitive and I've never once had a reaction to a moisturizer/sun screen before. I would STRONGLY suggest testing on a small area unless you're okay with risking walking around with a nasty rash for a couple of days. I have tried it again and it always burns in the same area but is fine everywhere else, not sure why.I understand that reactions vary by individuals, so I didn't think it would be fair to give this item one star. I don't believe it's the product's fault that my skin couldn't handle it, and like I said, it did work well everywhere else. I ordered other Olay products at the same time as this and have used them without incident."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've only had this cream for about a week now but so far so good. It is so smooth and creamy and really makes makeup go on smoothly. The one thing I don't like is if you use too much and don't rub it in really well right away it will flake off like peeling skin later in the day. I can't say much about its effects on lines or age spots yet but hopefully it helps!UPDATE: This lotion isn't really living up to my expectations. I'm not convinced it actually changes anything about your skin, it just slightly masks flaws. Once I run out I'm going back to my AveenoAveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 - 4 oz."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I hate it when my moisturizer slithers of my face like an oil slick, or is so thick you almost have to add water to spread it onto your face. Just one pump of this covers my face, neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute;. Makeup application is smooth, and seems to stay put longer than usual when I use this. I haven't noticed any major changes in the appearance of my fine lines, etcBut I do like he way my skin feels when I use this.  I'd order it again for sure."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this hoping to spend less on a daily facial cream with SPF.  I've been using Ole Henricksen's \"truth revealed super creme SPF 15\", which is $55 a jar.  Well, you definitely get what you pay for.  The smell of this \"unscented\" cream is so chemically (is that a word?) and sunscreeny, that it's almost unbearable to wear.  It is thick, so only a little bit is needed, but it isn't fully absorbed by my skin.  My makeup brushes have to be washed more frequently because of the residue and the smell (I don't want it to cross-contaminate into my blush/powder foundation).  I will not purchase again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am almost 33 but people says i look 20 something... They also thought I am still single but I told them I even have a 2 year old daughter! I used this product for 4 years already and until now I am amazed by how it works in my skin. It became smoother, tight and pore less. I love this with spf 15, not only it hydrates the skin but protects as well. This is really my beauty secret for looking young... I eat food so much, drink soda more than water but my skin still radiates plus the help of vitamins i take...So i really thank  olay total effects so much!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried many different brands of moisturizer for my very sensitive skin and found this to be completely non-irritating and it moisturizes well. I don't know what \"anti-aging\" means. I wouldn't say that I look any younger as a result of using it. I like that the same amount comes out each time with one press on the pump--it helps prevent accidentally squirting out too much. And I sure wouldn't want to do that because this stuff costs a whole lot per ounce for those of us on a limited budget. The best deal around is to buy a two-pack on Amazon. That cost will beat a retail purchase by several dollars."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product is amazing. I am 33 years old with combination skin and have always struggled with breakouts. I was looking for something that would prevent aging and reduce the impact of smoking on my skin without causing acne. Olay Total Effects moisturizer has meant incredibly smooth, soft skin and no more breakouts! Plus, it is SPF 15 so there is some sun protection included.Also, unlike most other moisturizers I have used, this absorbs well and does not cause unsightly beads of sweat to form on my forehead after application. The only thing I did not like was the scented version as the smell is insanely oppressive, but there is an unscented version available so that problem is easily solved.I highly reccommend this product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I liked that this was light and hydrating for my hands. As an artist, I work with a lot of mediums that require me to wash my hands afterward (i.e. paints, oil pastels), so one can imagine that my hands are prone to dryness. However, after two weeks of use, I got an allergic reaction from the lotion in the form of tiny, non-itchy bumps on the backs of my hands. I gave the rest to my friend who does like Aveeno, but I'll have to search for another hand lotion."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "While I'm not overly enthusiastic about the scent of this unscented product that is easily remedied by the addition of any essential oil I want to add before slathering this on my skin. The main ingredient seems to be Oat Kernel Flour and that is the main reason I buy this product.The skin calming and healing qualities of oatmeal are almost immediately apparent. Within a few days of using this product you will notice a difference in your skin.This lotion absorbs easily, it is smooth, healing and a creamy comforting addition to your day. If you enjoy scented lotions, try the Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion. I also enjoy using the Aveeno Body Wash and Soaps.If you want to scent this product, buy some rose oiland add a few drops. Rose oil helps to balance your emotionsand that in itself will help your skin.~The Rebecca Review"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Love it............... it cleans skin wounderful, if u boil hot water on the stove.steam it, take a hot washcloth and let it soak for about 1 min, cool the cloth down it a lilcold water.. put the cloth on your face let it sit there for about 1 min to open your pores.take a lil bit of facial cleanser and rub it on your face, then rinse of with cold water... skin comes outlooking like milk.. wait about 2 mins then put your favorite moisturizer on your skin, head out the door.and start your day.. trus me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Honestly, I couldn't tell if this cream was working or not. Yes my stretch marks faded, but it could have been them naturally fading over time. Regardless, it didn't hurt to go ahead and use the bottle up. After a while I didn't see any difference so I just stopped using it. I've also heard rumors that cocoa/shea butter has no proven affect on stretch marks. Perhaps IF I ever get stretch marks again I would re-try this product. It has a nice, subtle smell and it is very creamy. Not too thick, not too thin. It takes about 5-10 minutes to dry but it will definitely make your skin softer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I still got stretchmarks even with religious use of this product. After asking my doctor and reading books and online articles, I'm not sure if stretchmarks is something you can avoid by rubbing in some cream. I think genetics and your body shape plays a factor, too. I mean I have friends who just used plain old olive oil and coconut oil and didn't get stretchmarks. I had friends who didn't do anything and didn't get stretchmarks. Then there are gals that tried everything and still got stretchmarks.I still give it 4 stars because it's inexpensive enough that if you want to try it, it's very affordable. Plus it smells great and has a great texture. Rubs in easily and is a nice way to relax and bond with you baby in utero while giving yourself a little R&R; time and a belly massage. And this cream is very hydrating. I sometimes apply to hands and feet as well and it works great.If you want to try, go for it. Can't hurt!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I&#8217;m a fan of a lot of Palmers&#8217; products and was looking for a good body oil so I really thought I would like this. Having used baby oil in the past, I was shocked at how quickly this was used up. The baby oil would last easily through the winter and beyond, but this barely lasted a month. The consistency was quite thin and runny, so a lot of it was lost in the process of trying to apply. Then &#8211; possibly because of thinness? -  I felt like I needed more. I have used sweet almond oil in the past and it has a similar consistency. On the bright side, it smelled good and felt good, but because of the above issues I won&#8217;t be buying again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have had a few of these and I love it!!!  I ordered their newer model and ended up giving it to a friend.  I have very thick hair and it tends to be puffy and on the wavy side.  After I blow dry my hair, I use this and it smooths out my hair beautifully.  I can also flip my sides back and the bottom length under.  I hope that this isn't going to be discontinued.  It works way better than their newer model!  Please keep making these.  I recently ordered another because it works so well!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm not sure if I got a faulty product, but the \"hot\" air was not hot. It was lukewarm at best. As such, it did nothing at all to my hair except make it extremely frizzy. No curls or waves.You might have more luck than I with this product. And because Amazon allows you to return this after you've opened it (I've already spoken to a rep and created a return tag), no harm in trying. It's just not for me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It's a great product. I have had two before and my last one, of three years, died finally so I went to buy a replacement but could not find one anywhere. This Hot Air curling iron is a great price and it works great for my hair, which is on the thicker side and wavy. I can do anything from baby-doll curls with this thing to soft shiny waves or use it to shine my hair and give it some shape after straightening. It's a good multipurpose tool.The shipment on this thing was crazy fast. I ordered it and the third day it came to me. I did a test just now to see if it works and it does. Nothing was wrong with the packaging or the product. When I need one again I will defiantly buy from this person/business again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this product to alleviate symptoms from seasonal allergies. Every spring  my eyes itch and I'm constantly sneezing. Most allergy medications are too expensive and/or ineffective or cause drowiness. After researching the benefits of steam treatements for people like me I purchased the Conair Facial Sauna. I realize this product is designed for cosmetic reasons but it does the same thing the more expensive allergy/sinus steam machines do for a third of the price. I used it at night for 5 minutes and my eyes stop itching and I get restful sleep. I don't know if this product makes the skin glow as some other reviewers have claimed but it couldn't hurt. I would purchase again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The first one arrived & the facial sauna worked fine, but the little facial scrubber didn't.  Amazon replaced the entire package and everything works fine.  Is it like going to the spa and getting a facial?  No.  But then I didn't pay as much for this little device as the spa paid for the one they use.  The steam isn't a lot, it's gentle.  I did put a towel over my head & that helped.  The sinus attachment works well.  I am pleased with the purchase."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this steamer for the last 9 years.  My first lasted about 8 years, but got a little crusty by the end of it.  The timer option is great so  I don't have to keep track of time.  This one includes a convenient measuring cup.  I wasn't crazy about the exfoliation tool (prefer to use a combo of Cetaphil and baking soda), but I guess it does the job.  I use the steamer about 2x a week for blackheads."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using these for several years, and I try never to be without them. My face tends to get oily in the afternoons, and a quick dab all over with one of these completely takes care of it without disturbing my makeup.  I took off one star because they aren't quite as big as I would like.  If you're oily enough that you need to use the whole sheet, you end up having to hold it by a spot that is already used and then you have your face oil on your fingers.  If the sheets were a little bigger, that wouldn't be a problem.  Overall, though, one of my favorite products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used this during the day for a couple months in conjunction with the Q10 night cream and it seemed to help soften the wrinkles I had started to notice.  Doesn't aggravate my acne prone skin and I like this lotion better than the night cream since the consistency is light and absorbs well and the smell is very minimal (plain suntan/lotion smell).  Works fine under my makeup.  Would be great if they offered it with a slightly higher spf to last just a bit longer (since I don't reapply over my makeup)."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This curling iron is pretty good, but it does not have a strong enough spring to keep hair in place when curling. I have learned to correct this by hair-spraying the strands of hair I am about to curl. Then I clamp the hair under the metal clip about an inch or two up from the end of the strand. If you try to clamp your hair at the tip--it will not hold. You have to start an inch or two up from the edge to get it to hold. But if you do that, and if you hair spray it first--this curler can make some excellent spirals. I give this item 4 stars because it was basically the cheapest ringlet curler I could find. And this product does give me the curl I want, it just takes a little bit of finesse. But if you want something stronger and easier to use, look elsewhere."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Doesn't heat up enough.  I had it on my hair for 20 seconds without it feeling hot to the touch, on the highest setting.The on/off buttons are in the way and I turned it off by mistake at least 3 times just trying to curl the front of my hair, before I gave up and used another iron.I did get a cute curl once, but it went away by the time I did the next strand.  I knew I hated Revlon curlers, but this was the biggest one I could find at the store.  Hopefully the store will take the curling iron back unwrapped."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Anything I every purchase by revlon was cheap and works great as high pricey products. Packaging was great as if it was just light books were inside and delivery was perfect timing for me.  If you haven't tried anything by revlon then I really recommend all there products and purchasing them from this seller when needed to. It's really worth every cent you worked for and heats up in seconds when your on the go. I really have to complete the whole entire set by getting the other size barrels by revlon that works wonders on any type of hair.Thanks!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This may be great for some people but the information listed neglects to tell you that this is a flat barrel 1/2 inch iron which is suppose to give ribbon like curls. Although the package says ribbon curl I didnt realize the barrel was going to be flat and I was a little disappointed when I got it. That's the only downside, everything else like the settings, heat, and tangle free cord all work great and shipping was fast. So if your into ribbon looking curls then this iron would be for you otherwise keep looking."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this scrub (sensitive skin, original, and the acne varieties) for over 10 years now.  It's a great basic scrub that is inexpensive.  I use it every morning in the shower and my makeup goes on a lot more evenly once I've exfoliated with it.  My best friend tried it out when she stayed over my place and has been using it ever since as well.  Even my boyfriend loves it and says that it prevents ingrown hairs on his face and neck from shaving.  This is a great scrub and I'm going to keep buying it as long as St. Ives is making it.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The first time I used this product (over a year ago), I almost cried. A hypoallergenic moisturizer that was hydrating AND brightening AND from a brand that is organic and eco-friendly?? Heck yes! It worked wonders for my dry, hypersensitive skin.However, this is the second time I've purchased this and something seems&#8230; different. It's less hydrating (I have to apply at least two layer for any moisture benefits) and almost feels itchy (although that may be due to the lack of moisturizing powers it has, not the formula itself). However, it still brightens and smells nice. I just use it in combination with another hypoallergenic moisturizer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'll start by saying I have very sensitive skin, and this did not bother me, so that's definitely a positive! My skin is also very dry, and this is a nice thick, unscented cream that moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel. As far as the wrinkle reducing power, we'll have to see. It claims visible results within 5 weeks, so I'll have to wait a little longer. In the meantime, it's a great moisturizer for sensitive skin for before bed and under my makeup in the morning."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very sensitive facial skin.  The slightest fragrance or unassuming offending chemical can cause rashes, stinging and all sorts of unpleasantness.I have tried many, many products. From high end premium brands to drugstore brands. I have found some high end brands that are truly great, but also very expensive.So based on reviews her on Amazon, and the reasonable price,  I decided to try Eucerin Q10. I have been using it for five days, and I love it. It is a thick, rich cream  goes on smoothly and is absorbed rapidly. Skin feels really moisturized after application. I use it in the morning before makeup application and again at night before bed. Smooth skin and no irritations!I can't say if it will deliver on promise to reduce facial line. I'll let you know in six months.For those who are paraben sensitive, this creme does contain parabens. The creme is also a yellow color, which the box describes as being the intended color (result of natural ingredients)."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm a cashier at Rite aid, and this guy came to my check stand and bought 2 of the Eucerin Q10 cremes. I asked him if it worked well, and his answer was pretty much \"it's amazing and only rite aid sells it!\"So since it was buy one get the second one 50 % off I decided to get the Q10 and the night creme.I get very dry skin, def when the whether is cold. It gets peely and red and it's awful to deal with. Also, I tend to break out with this whether. I opened the container and I was happy that is was truly fragrance free (my skin will break out with fragrances). The yellow color is from all the natural ingredients, it's not bad at all. It's a thicker cream, but when I apply it in the morning I can put make up over it and work all day and everything is good! My dry, red skin is gone too. This creme is amazing. :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Well first let me say,i don't have wrinkles or hard lines(im in my 20s) i use anti-wrinkles washes and creams to hopefully help prevent them in the future,so i can't comment from an anti-wrinkle view point however i have very oily,sensitive skin that can easily get a small break out. I started using this among other products and started to notice i would get small breakouts, i figured it must be the other new product cleansers and toners i was using cause eucerin has never given me breakouts,so i stopped using the other products,and tested this product on certain areas on my face only,and sure enough those exact spots had the new abrasions. I have super oily skin,i believe this product causes clogged pores which leads to the breakouts,i suggest you avoid if you have oily skin,i will continue to use this product of my neck and chest to get rid of it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a lot like the Nivea Visage Q10 that stopped coming to the US and you can buy online still (made by the same company, Beiersdorf, in their factory in Poland). It's impressively cheap, it moisturizes really well, you can use it morning or night, it has no fragrance or dye, so you can use it around your eyes without them getting red or swollen.Negatives - it doesn't have the immediate effectiveness that retinol products do, then again you can't use those during the day. Also, an sunscnreen would make this more useful. I'm not a fan of using many different lotions, so I'm unlikely to buy this again, as it's neither an ideal night nor day lotion, even if it is a great value and a solid product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This cream is just too thick for my face and I am using it on my hands.  I tried it around my eyes and on my neck and it just started falling off in gobs when I rubbed my neck.  Gross.  I will not put it on my face again and will just use it up as hand cream.  I might mention that I am a 65-year-old boomer babe with oily skin still and don't have wrinkles yet and didn't want to get them.  I would rather get wrinkles than have this thick stuff or the greasy lotion on my face.  Both are good for the hands though and people can tell your age from your wrinkled hands too."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Better late than never! This cream is amazing, it's rich without being super greasy and has vitamins (A, C, E), no oils, no parabens, fragrance free it's very gentle yet effective. I love it and its now a staple for me. I don't know why Eucerin dosent advertise this face cream especally since it has vitamin C and E which is all the rage in anti-aging face products.My only gripe is that it needs to be in a tube not a jar because of the vitamins.Ingrediants: Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotine, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this product for almost a year now and as with all Eucerin products it is the best. There are products on the market that are selling for 5 times what this cost and this is every bit as good. I'm 70 years old and look 10 to 20 years younger. This product makes my facial skin soft and moist looking. The first few times I applied it I could feel my skin tightening particularly around the eyes. I use about a jar a month as I apply it morning and evening."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I suffer from dry hands... My own fault - I hate to wear rubber gloves when I do things. This lotion is a saver. It has NO water whatsoever and all the good stuff. So, a good sugar scrub and an application of this later, my hands look like I've never done any housework in my life. Highly recommended. I know it's a body lotion, but the rest of me is not dry enough to waste this on... It is rich, so if your legs are dry from shaving, it will probably save them too."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "i went to the drugstore looking for queen helene's mint julep mask, but i couldn't find it, so i picked this up instead. i really like this mask as well, it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it's very easy to rinse off. i have sensitive skin and i haven't had any breakouts or adverse reactions to it after using it. the only things i don't like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them, and it's a little itchy when it dries."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have struggled with acne, blackheads, and scars since age 11. I have tried lots of products and seen dermatologists with little help. Now, about to turn 30 and still dealing with these issues, I tried this product after all of the reviews. I cannot tell you how amazing this is. It's so affordable, too. Admittedly, I use it 1 to 2 times a day for my best results. My pores are much clearer and squeezing the blackheads on the nose, which my esthetician used to do, (the only place I would squeeze d/t scarring), has become much easier and I have to do it less frequently with regular use. For the price, I would recommend everyone try it until the product is gone and see how it goes for you!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have pretty sensitive skin and have tried a number of different masks through out the years and they almost always either make my face itchy, or cause me to break out after using them (in those horrible, big and painful zits!)...this one doesn't! It seems like it both dries out the extra oil in my skin, and moisturizes at the same time. After washing it off my skin is always a lot softer. If my skin is a little dried out I tend to get those little bumps on the outer edges of my cheeks, but they always clear up when I use this. It has a good consistency and is easy to apply, though if you wash it off with a wash cloth it looks sort of nasty, but no big deal. It does have a little bit of a scent to it, but it's not a fake perfumey type of scent, it's a more natural one. And one of my favorite things about this mask, it's cheap! Definitely recommend!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This avocado & oatmeal masque is super cheap and I know some people complain about the ingredients. People! You get what you pay, if you want something better, pay extra to get something fancy to suit your needs. This tube is big enough so this should last me longer than 6 months really since I use it maybe once a week.I like how this helped me a little with reducing the size of pores. My face feels fresh and tight after I use this. My only complains are that whenever I apply this on my face, it stings my eyes so much although I did not apply it close around the eyes either, just around cheek area. Overall, I like it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I absolutely love this face mask, its the best one i have used.It evens out my skin, soothes it and makes my skin feel clean and feel really nice. I use this product once and a while and do spot treatment on places where i am prone to get breakouts (i touch my face a lot on my chin and i use this to wash this area to prevent breakouts)I have been using this product for years now, and I still haven't run out. I dont use it too often but when i do its really nice and refreshing for my skin. its lasted so long that my bottle isn't updated to this photo, but its the same ingredients. I will be re purchasing this product as im almost finally running out. I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Even though I am pushing 50, and my skin is pretty dry, I still keep this clay masque on hand. Why? Because I have large pores that are getting (ack!) even bigger as I age. With one use, I can see my pores visibly reduced. With two I'm almost back to \"Pores? What pores?\" This stuff is super cheap, you get a lot for your money and it works.General 411: I usually put this all over my face (except eyes and mouth, of course),leave it on 20-ish minutes to let it dry. Rinse with a wash cloth then follow with a good moisturizer on my drier bits. The next day I exfoliate really well to get rid of any dry skin flakes. After this 1-2 procedure, I look like I've had a professional facial!Unfortunately, there's no way to \"cure\" large pores, but this masque certainly helps keep them in check."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If you are looking for a peeling mask this one is pretty good.  It dries fast and you can get a good peel with it - all in one sheet. It seems to help to control my sons acne a little.I made the mistake of after the mask, using a blackhead tool and clearing out anything that came to the surface --- well everything came out easily but he was left with a face full of red marks and scabs for like a week, so I felt terrible. It draws everything to the surface and leaves the skin extra soft and sensitive and more easy to tear and damage.So I'd recommend just using the mask - and not picking after! I've used it several times without picking and it's been fine."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I guess I don't know how to use a facial peel off mask or something, but I am not happy. First off, it's like glue. It's the same thing as getting elmers glue, just smells like cucumbers. I can't spread it around to my face and it peels off like glue on your hands. You know when you get glue on your hands and peel it off as a kid? Same thing, except you can't spread it around like Elmer's. It took me forever to get it off my face and was not nice because I have peach fuzz. It got in my hair and I had to wash it out, and I didn't see a difference whatsoever in my face except that it was red from trying to get it all off. If you want a pain in the ass (and I don't like to cuss), buy this. This is something that I would never recommend to anyone whatsoever. If I'm doing it the wrong way, please someone tell me!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a fun product to buy and it actually works well. If you are going to use this I would suggest applying the product liberally so that you do not have a thin layer but a nice thick one. I also suggest leaving this product on for longer than 10 minutes, maybe around 15 so that it really gets to dry. Before you apply the product pull back your hair because it can get a little annoying when the product gets stuck to your hair. I would also be mindful not to get any on your eyebrows cause it can get inbetween the little hairs.Once you remove the mask you'll find that your skin is nice and soft and less oily. It does remove dead skin but do not anticipate removal of blackheads. It also leaves you with a nice soothing/cooling sensation afterwards."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Cucumber cool facial that is just what I wanted. My favorite was discontinued years ago and the Freeman brand isn't one I was familiar with until Amazon. Use a thin layer for best results . . . drying time is 10 min. or less. Soothing for sensitive and mature skin. Can be used daily. Product information and description is accurate. It does feel a bit sticky so just rinse your hands and remember that a thin layer accomplishes the desired results. The tube makes it easy to use and store.Consider the other peel masks offered by Freeman . . . Pomegranate is another good choice from this line of products.Definitely recommended!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This won't take off blackheads or renew your skin overnight, but for what you pay for its ok. It does make my skin softer, reduce some redness, and has a calming smell. I mainly use this with my younger sisters when I visit from College. It breaks a bit when you peel unless you are very slow about it. When applying to your face you might want to make sure you have water on the side to start washing your hands off, its very sticky and needs a bit of soap to get off! Imagine applying it then turning the water on, you'll get the handle nasty. If that happens just wait to peel it off when it dries, but kinda annoying if you have OCD!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I just brought this product yesterday at Walgreens for $4.29 and I love it. It smells great, it's a little sticky but it works. When I opened the top I wasn't expecting a clear gel like substance, I was a little hesitant at first but I followed the directions. It will dry fast so smooth it over your face fast and wait about 20 minutes and peel it off and then wash your face. 5-10 minutes is not long enough in my opinion and make sure to not put it on your eyebrows or sideburns because when your peeling it off it will be very hard to get it off your hair. If you do run into this problem do not panic just simply wash it off your face with warm water. Your face will be left feeling smooth and smelling great. The bumps on my face are smaller but not as noticeable but I will continue to use this product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have not owned a blow dryer since 197?. However, after seeing so many products for curly blow dried hair  in Ulta, Target etc I thought maybe I should reconsider the blow dryer. I went on youtube to see what the latest info was on blow dryers. After watching lots of vids on youtube and reading amazon reviews I bought this from my local drug store. I thought if it didn't work for me I could keep it on hand for folks with straight hair when they stayed over at my house. I tried it and love the result.  I have coarse curly hair and it took less than 20 min to dry. The button placement was a bit odd, but it is an easy thing to learn. Additionally, it is not very noisy and my bathroom doesn't smell like burnt hair. I could nit pick and give this product 3 or 4 stars but I think with operator practice and a phenomenal price point it warrants 5 stars."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For me, I have tried so many different blow dryers for me baby fine and hard to manage hair. And these previously tried blow dryers blew my hair dry fast of course (I have thin hair), however, they dulled my hair and also damaged my hair as the drying velocity was much too strong and the heating was just too hot!So I tried the Conair 1875 blow dryer and was AMAZED and BLOWN AWAY (no pun intended)! This dryer I have found to dry my hair quickly and gently. Also, my hair is shinier and much more manageable.If you have baby fine hair like I do, this is the blow dryer for you!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this hair dryer after my old one seemed to be taking a long time to dry my very long hair. I also had just bought another ionic hair drying tool and I loved how it helped prevent my hair from getting frizzy. I went to the store and tried out a bunch of hair dryers ranging up to $200 and this one seemed to be just as powerful as some of these very expensive dryers. I also loved that it was ionic. It does a great job at drying my hair and the attachments are really great too. I also paid double in the store for what it is listed at here."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I thought this was a more powerful dryer...my bad. I'm going to keep it since I like the color (LOL) and it dries well  with a high and low setting and 2 speeds, and has concentrator and attachment for curls. Both attachments are very tough to take off...I'm so afraid I'll break one of them....they need a better system to get them on and off. The dryer is only 1275 watts, not exactly powerful. And, very important, the buttons for high/low/off/ and heat settings are very small, and placed badly. I keep accidentally turning off the blower!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "With below the shoulder hair, I found this to dry it quickly and without burning.  I have fine, thick hair so usually it takes 10 minutes or more to dry ... and other dryers run so hot that they burn if focused in one spot for more than a moment (to set a wave, for instance).  This gets just hot enough to be safe and pleasant to use.The finger-attachment might be useful if someone else is styling your hair, but my arms (I'm 5'9\") aren't long enough to make its use practicable.Two speeds, two heat settings (plus cold-shot button) actually give a very usable range for drying efficiently.  Took me less time than with my previous dryer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This blow dryer is a little on the heavy side, and the sound isn't exactly quiet either. BUT, like most people said, I do feel a difference in the way my hair looks and feels when I use this one compared to other regular dryers. My hair tends to be dry to begin with, so maybe that's why i notice the change. But if you already have smooth hair, I wouldn't know how the product performs. Another plus is that it dries my hair quickly...takes about 1/2 the time I usually need."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Wow, never thought I would purchase anything else but Origins and this product proved me otherwise.  So far it has moisturized my face very well during the day (I have dry skin and sometimes flaky on my forehead, chin area and lightly on my cheeks during the winter season in the east coast).  You would have to try it since everyone's face will respond to it differently and depending on what season and where you are residing will also make a difference.  This is my first time being in the east coast during the winter season so my face is a lot more dehydrated (it has not yet acclimated to the east coast winter weather, if it will ever be) in any case this product has done it's job and I have been very happy of it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used Alba See Moss Moisturizer daily religiously for over a year - no problems and you can't beat the price. I apply after morning wash, before applying foundation. I don't use the coordinating wash all the time. Most of Alba's products have impressed me for the price, this line is formulated especially for malasma, which is what drew me to it in the first place. I use the Alba Sea Moss night cream also with a hyaluronic acid gel from Reviva Labs to help with tone and discoloration. My skin looks great and I always get compliments on how nice my skin looks. Definitely recommend for women who are 35+ and have skin discoloration from too much sun or hormonal changes. So until this causes problems or Alba discontinues it, I'll keep doing what I'm doing."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this for about 2 weeks now. I got this product hoping it would be a huge turn around for my overly dry skin. And while sadly my skin is still dry, it is less harsh than regular body washes out there and leaves me feeling very moisturized after a shower. However, the relief only seems to last mere minutes. I'm still having to use lotion all over my body on a daily basis. Maybe my results will change with the season as right now its winter and the air is fairly dry, but I'm not so sure.  The smell isn't horrible, but its also not great. And when I received the package body wash had leaked all per inside the box and all over the bottle. That Was something I was most definitely not happy with. I will probably, however, continue to use the product as organic stuff is still healthier for your skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First off, The description states that is had a paraben it it. IT DOES NOT!! Parabens are harmful to us , manufacturers like them because they preserve the shelf life of a product which is cancerous to our bodies. Alba botanica products do not contain parabens especially not this item. It is written in big bold letters on the bottle:No animal testing, artificial colors, prabens, phthalates, sodium lauryl/lareth or methyl sulfate. !!When I step out the shower, my skin looked so well moisturized, I didnt even need to lotion. It was radiant, as if I went to the spa. I loved the shine so much, Im excited everytime I use it. Unlike the minty version of this product this one has actual moisturizing benefits and I suffer from dry skin so that's a plus!It smells wonderful and what can I say its a great NATURAL product!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I just purchased and used this body wash from Alba today. I bought it from Super Supplements for around $14. I figured the larger size would last me longer then the smaller bottle.The smell is very pleasant, and after showering with this product my skin is soft and not overdried.

And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face, even though I didn't use that much! It just looked so bad, I didn't feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all. Buy at your own risk"}

I decided to try the Healthy Defense product instead.I am 57 years old and although I like this product I do prefer the Ageless Intensives because I feel like it hydrates my skin better than the Healthy Defense.  This product goes on a little thicker and doesn't feel as light on my skin.I have found that if I am working outside for several hours, I still need a sunscreen product under this one.  It does not seem to be as effective in blocking the sun as I would expect for an SPF 30.All in all, this is an acceptable sub until the Ageless product becomes available.  If you have younger skin or do not spend hours outside this may be the perfect product for you."}

No clumping or flaking.Cannot believe I&iexcl;ve been paying for Estee Lauder all these years when this works just as well for me.

Now that I am in my 40's I find that liquid foundation doesn't apply well and leaves my face looking flaky.  This product is perfect to use in place of liquid, applies evenly and covers blemishes well.  It can be applied throughout the day to reduce shininess and doesn't cake or build up.  This is the only product I use unless I am going for a more dramatic look, in which case I use a silicone primer and liquid but, even then I apply this on top of the liquid with a brush to reduce shine"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This sunblock provides great physical sun protection.  It is good for people who have normal or combination to oily skin.  It feels a little heavy on your face but not as gross or greasy as regular sunblock or sunscreen.  It actually provides decent coverage and evens out your skin tone quite nicely.  The concept of being able to adjust the color of the foundation is pretty cool.  I wish cosmetic companies would provide regular foundations with this concept.  The color is pretty neutral, neither warm nor cool toned.  I could see, however, that on darker skin tones it could possibly be a little ashy due to the mineral sunblock content."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is by far the best sun block I have ever used.  It goes on well and does the job it says it will, totally blocks the sun.  I used it in Florida recently and never burned and I have skin that burns within 20 to 30 minutes of strong sunlight.  Also this did not cause any irritation to my super sensitive skin.  I use in whenever I see that we are having a sunny day as UV rays penetrate car windows.  The key to using this product is to put it on about 20 to 30 minutes before going out and to reapply every three hours or so."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used the Olay Regenerist cleanser, St. Ives scrub, Neutrogena, Estee Lauder, Ahava - need I go on? But I really like this Aveeno scrub (though \"scrub\" is a bit of an overstatement considering how small the beads are). I like the citrusy smell and the way it cleans gently. I wish it were a little more scrubby but I can't seem to find something that's about half way between this and the super-rough St. Ives so I'll stick with this until I do."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This stuff isn't very moisturizing at all. It has SPF 30 which automatically makes it thicker, plus the tint, this is just as moisterizing as foundation. I don't use foundation so I like that this is a very light foundation substitute, and that's what I would call it, not a moisterizer. I mix mine with grapeseed or emu oil so that it goes on slick and not cakey. When combined with my facial oil, I love the stuff..... But by itself? No good.Also I have moderate acne which I try VERY hard to keep under control, and this product does NOT make me break out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "STAY AWAY FROM IT IF YOU WEAR CONTACTS AND HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. I put this on my face and it felt alright for the first hour. I noticed my eyes started getting irritated and a rash on my forehead. My eyes looks stressed and was red. I didn't put this on the next day and my eyes felt way better and no rash. However my face is red from the irritation from this sunscreen. This product seems like the perfect choice for me:A daily moisturizer that has clinically proven Total Soy Complex and natural light diffusers that work to naturally even out skin toneGentle enough for sensitive skin and daily useOil freeHypoallergenicNoncomedogenic(won't clog pores)but the result turned out to be a bad product for me...I wish I could get my money back. If you wear contacts do not buy this. This product has a very heavy scent that will irritate your eyes and you will be desperate to take your contacts off....."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I cannot use liquid foundation. I have tried tons of different products and everything I use, no matter how light, turn orange on my skin after a very short time. I decided to try tinted moisturizer and this seems to blend like I was hoping it would. This is not for someone who needs a lot of coverage. I have normal skin and I don't get acne very often so I don't need anything full coverage. I tried this and for the first 2 days I used it it seemed to blend well, I would still wipe some off after I went out into the sunlight, but I didn't have to remove all of it. This morning I put it on and it wasn't even on my skin for 5 minutes and I looked like I was turning into an oompa loompa. No matter how much I tried to blend it around my skin. Maybe I am destined to never wear liquid makeup. :("}

The bottle is very poorly designed; product builds up on the outside, and then dries up, and has to be removed. It's kind of gross. It wastes product, too. I ended up discontinuing use of this product before I ran out, because of how much glitter it contains."}

I should state however that I have a very clear youthful complexion with combination skin.

It does feel silky but like I said for someone with combination skin it might be too greasy/heavy. I feel like I'm wearing makeup. I'm certain that if my skin was dry I would love it though."}

Some people, like my brother, prefer the large beads in a facial scrub, but I like the smaller beads in this one. Because the beads are finer, it feels like it's exfoliating more evenly. It can also be used in combination with other products, where as other facial scrubs might be too harsh for combination with anything else in the day. I would recommend trying it out; It's effective, cheap, and the tube lasts for a really long time."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I work in Afghanistan and had a hard time keeping any time of make-up on in the summers because of the heat.  I would sweat it off immediately.  I got this in the hopes of it staying on a little better, giving me some protection from the sun and being able to reapply through the day without it looking like I just added another layer of foundation.  This is pretty much a very light foundation.  I don't think it moisturized my face at all and it didn't cover any red spots or blemishes.  I was disappointed because I normally love Aveeno products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have pretty clear but dry skin. I wanted something light and easy to apply that wouldn't dry out my skin. I decided to take a chance on this one since I generally like Aveeno. I'm really pale so I did like that it added a tiny bit of color to my face and that I could just rub it like any moisturizer.Aside from that, I didn't like the sparkles in it. I can't tell you how hard it is for me to find a foundation or tinted moisturizer that doesn't have sparkles in it. I prefer my makeup to look like I'm not wearing any, the sparkles take away from that illusion.This is just a preference though, because apparently there are people who do like all that glitter in their makeup but if you're like me and prefer a more natural look, try a Korean BB cream instead like Skin79."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I work full time and go to school at night so I was looking for a product that I could throw on in a hurry that was able to stand in place of make up. I have combination skin so a moisturizer was just what I was looking for. At first I LOVED this product! It covered quiet well and was very moisturizing. However, I only wore it for 4-5 hours at a time while I was in class. I later tried it on a weekend and noticed I had some minor break outs. The more I used it the more I broke out. Then I noticed there is SHIMMER in it! If you have acne shimmer will accentuate your break outs. Awful!Pros:Coverage; Not quite as good as make up but able to stand inSmell; VERY light smell of sun tan lotion, other than that unscentedFeel; It goes on pretty thick but absorbs into the skin well so you don't feel too greasy. Heavier than my normal face lotion, thoughSPFCons:SHIMMER!Caused break outs"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Bought this today at Publix (our local grocery) on clearance for $8.00.  I really didnt need a sunscreen, just a tinted moisturizer as I dont like to wear foundation in Fla. in the hot humid season.  I read the other reviews and (1) The texture is due to the spf30 and quickly absorbs into the skin.  (2) Dont buy this if you have very dry skin as it is a lighweight moisturizer.  The fair to light works fine for me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "PROS- I LOVE the way this makes my skin look! It has light reflectors that highlight parts of my face and gives my skin this gorgeous sheen.- SPF- Skin looks more even after continuous use.*CONS- *Unfortunately, it clogs my pores and causes me to break out if I leave it on all day; on the other hand, if I wash it off immediately when I get home after a few hours, my skin looks better.- Not water resistant. It will &#34;melt&#34; when it comes in contact with water.I've recently started trying to use more natural, eco-friendly products. Aveeno Positively Radiant Tinted Moisturizer isn't 100% natural and I believe it has an EWG rating of 3 with limited information from Aveeno. Although it seems to clog my pores and melts when it comes in contact with water, I REALLY like the way it looks. I use it when I know that I won't be out all day, that I won't be around water and I want to look fresh."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't like heavy foundations, at all. I've been trying to stick strictly to bare minerals, but in the desert heat that I live in it's impossible for the minerals to stick to my dry skin. This moisturizer is the perfect remedy! The coverage isn't total, but that's what I love most about it! It minimizes flaws so you don't look like you're trying too hard, it really makes your skin look natural. The light reflectors are nice too because they give my skin that youthful dewy look. I tone it down a bit with my bare minerals powder, but it's nice to feel like your skin looks healthy, and that's exactly what this product does.Also, I never felt that this moisturizer was too thick. One pump gave me total coverage and spread really easily. They only had medium in my store, and I have fair skin, but I still found it to blend really well with my skin color. I love, Love, LOVE this product!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have tried facial creams priced from 200 dollars to 4.99!  Aveeno is the very best without question.  It hydrates, smooths, lightens dark areas, and is never greasy.  Just try it once ~  you wont regret it!NOTE:  I recently discovered I have a wheat intolerance.  SOME, not all, Aveeno product use wheat and oats.  Even on my skin, I had problems with reactions.  If you do not have wheat issue...  The Aveeno line is excellent in both results and social responsibility."}

To due skin cancer and using Renova, I have got to SPF my skin all year.I love Aveno products & my skin lady uses them after treatment. I am a natural platinum blonde so i go from very pale in the winter to a light tan as the weather warms.In general, this is a good quality product with adequate coverage & excellent SPF protection &  while transparent it also evens out the complexion. I believe it has a powder base as this seems to sink into large pores and deep lines. TO avoid this, I put 3 drops of a higher SPF &  mix it into the Aveno and then apply. This takes care of the problem.I also bought the light and medium and mix the two together to get the perfect shade. I store it mixed in a clean glass baby food jar & capped tight."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I discovered this product when I was searching for something to cover up the whiteness caused by Aveeno 85 Sunblock. This moisturizer is perfect for that purpose. It has SPF 30, which is not relevant to me, since it's going on over the heavy sunblock, but that is a nice feature for anyone wanting to protect their skin. I use the Fair to Light tint, and it covers up the sunscreen with a nice even coverage. It's very sheer and natural looking and I have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since I started using it. I don't use a lot, just one pump in the morning and I'm done, so it lasts a really long time. Like all the Aveeno products, it has a faint pleasant smell that doesn't linger. Well worth the price."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was using Aveeno Skin Complexion Skin Care before I tried this one. In preparation for the summer, I thought I would get an Aveeno product with SPF. Unfortunately, I got 3 big pimples after I started using this Aveeno product. When I returned to the Aveeno product I used before, my skin  cleared up, and honestly, my skin hasn't looked this great in a long time. So I guess this a recommendation for Aveeno Skin Complexion Care b/c I'd rather not have pimples. I still have the almost-full, used bottle of this stuff. Oh well..."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a fantastic product! I cannot wash my hair without it.  I am so used to this towel sucking up all the extra water that when I just use a normal bath towel it actually feels weird to have all the excess water in my hair.  This also cuts down on a lot of blowdryer time too. I have fine, medium length hair and this works fantastic for me.  I highly, highly recommend this for anyone who wants to save time on drying their hair in the morning and get out of the door faster."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Having obtained one of the Aquis towels from a brick and mortar store over 2 years ago, I decided to get another for gym and travel purposes. The previous Aquis towel has stood in good stead, maintaining its smooth feel and quickly drying after use. Even if you have short or medium length hair, using this towel as a turban and then using it to absorb some of the water left in your hair can shorten your time with a wet head or your time under the blow drier. Or if you choose, drape it over your pillow and you won't end up with a \"terry cloth\" face the next morning after slumber.If you're traveling to someplace where towels are stingy or none existent, this would be a good general use item to take along without too much weight or bulk. You won't dry your body with it but it would make a good supplement."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It's not just an ad campaign, a super-absorbent towel really does speed up hair drying. I spend less time with the hair dryer when I use this towel. Less time with the hair dryer means my hair looks less fried out and feels softer.I liked the idea of the hair turbans that came out a few years ago, but realistically they never quite fit. For me the loops and buttons and such were not in quite the right place for my particular head. A flat towel works much better for me. It is nice and long so I can make my own turban.I have two different brands of these hair towels. The Aquis one is much softer than the other one.I confess that I pretty much ignore any special laundry instructions. I figure it lives in the bathroom, it must be laundered with the other bath towels with no special care. So far it is holding up well under that arrangement."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Years ago, I bought a similar towel from the Body Shop (I'm talking fifteen years ago) and was terribly upset when it reached its final days.  I searched but couldn't find a similar one on the market.  When I saw this as a suggestion for me (thanks Amazon) I read the reviews and purchased it. Now I haven't had it long enough to notice any kind of smell, but I immediately noticed the difference versus a regular towel.  I have fine hair that doesn't take too long to dry, but I like to get it as dry as possible before I expose it to the heat of a blow dryer.  Not only am I going to order a couple more for me, I plan on ordering them this Christmas as presents for the girls in my life.  Don't hesitate!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have to admit that this has been used as a spare dryer for the past year, but it is still used twice a month at least. It saw heavy use with waist length hair the three years prior. Even though it now costs almost half of what I paid for it, I still think it is a decent value. My Rusk 1900 watt ceramic dryer blows this dryer away, but it isn't fair to compare an $80 dryer to something that now costs $15. The amount of heat is pretty good and it gets my hair dry in an acceptable amount of time. The cold air button is really more of a \"less hot air\" than actual cold air, but I really don't have a use for cold air, anyway. After all these years, the cord is starting to bend oddly right at the plug, so I don't think it has a lot of life in it left unless I find a way to replace the cord. But I still think I got my money's worth."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I gave this dryer a 5 because I am very satisfied with the speed that it dries and how soft and smooth my hair is right afterwards.  This is probably not the only dryer that will give these kinds of results and it's probably not the best.  But if you have thick long hair like mine(reaches my waist)this is a handy tool.  It is a little heavy but it shouldn't be a problem if you only need to hold it for 5-10 minutes.  The real reason why I chose this ionic dryer is because I love Revlon's button configuration. The top button lets me adjust the temperature from cool, warm to hot.  And the bottom button adjusts the air flow from low, med to high. It lets me control and style my hair how I want to. I get so frustrated when the temperature corresponds to the air flow setting because it won't let me use hot on low or cool on med...catch my drift?  Anyway, nice dryer:)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I also saw this product used by Paula on the Real World Key West and I love her wavy hair so I thought I'd try this out for a cheap enough price. I have super thick hair which can be slightly wavy if I let it dry naturally but I also have some straight sections too. This waver made my hair look like I have a loose perm, I love it. And if you want to have more defined waves/curls you can scrunch in some mouse or whatever styling product you prefer. My hair is about four inches past my shoulders and it took me 30 minutes to do all of it, but like I said my hair is very thick. This is a great way to get wavy hair without getting a perm."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been wearing this as long as they've been making it. I only wear clear because I'm very fair complected and color looks weird on me. My lips are small too so I prefer just gloss. It has a very subtle sparkle and will keep your lips conditioned. It's not sticky like so many are. It's very easy to apply while driving or sitting at a light. When I finish a tube, I take an orange stick (for manicures)and scoop the rest out from the base of the tube. Then I put it in a small plastic container. You wouldn't believe how much is left in the base! Probably at least another month of usage."}

{"label": 4, "raw": "I like these pads and use them in the morning on days when my skin feels and looks dull. One side is is the exfoliating side and the other is smooth. There is plenty of cleanser on each pad so it gets nice and frothy. I wouldn't use these daily as it is not a good idea to exfoliate your face every day but instead once a week. It would be wasteful to use the pads daily if you are using the soft side as you can just Aveeno cleanser and wash using your hands or a wash cloth. This would not only be better for the environment as you are wasting less but also more cost effective. As good as it might feel to scrub your face each morning, the long-term effect could be an increase in breakouts or make breakouts worse as they don't get a chance to heal. I liked the product, just not for daily use."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I like the aveeno day moisturizer very much so thought will give this soap a try. But it made the skin very very dry. On top of it started getting more acne. So discontinued using. I got a pack of 3. My husband uses the aveeno face wash and really likes it. Since 2 more soaps were left over and also each and every person skin type and tolerance level are different. We thought he would try using it. But it made him break out immediately. He skin is normal and never had problem with breakouts. So that is it.. We thrashed it and never thought about buying again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm one of those people who had a sprinkling of acne as a teen (which was taken care of by Retin-A) and then nothing until later in life. For some reason, when I turned 35- BOOM. My skin went haywire. I went to a dermatologist and he gave me a variety of things, but the basic advice was stick to a \"clean\" soap (I usePurpose Gentle Cleansing Bar, 6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 2)) and use a deep cleaning product with salicylic acid.The Aveeno Clear Complexion pads REALLY worked. I don't use them everyday, maybe three times a week, because they are very drying. But they definitely clean the skin well. I also use them in conjunction with a pure sea salt scrub (I dip the pad in the loose sea salt and scrub my face) and it does an AMAZING job of cleaning my skin and keeping it clear without turning it into a dry painful mess.So, I highly recommend this for anyone dealing with fussy skin!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used to use a moisturizer from Yves Rocher but it got too expensive and it was only 1.7 oz.This product is amazing and is much better than what I was using.

I haven't had any acne since I have been using this product which is an amazing 2 weeks!This product is very affordable and I love that it is 4 oz.I use this moisturizer with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Bar. These 2 products are really great together."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "With my adult acne I have to pamper my skin or it gets too dry.  I love this face wash because my skin feels amazingly clean and SUPER soft and moisturized after washing.

When I am having hormonal breakouts I have to attack my problen skin with several different products and techniques.  This is a frontline weapon for use several times a day.As a middle-ages woman I look for products that are fierce on blemishes, but gentle to my skin underneath.  This satisfies."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "i LOVE this moisturizer. It is thick enough that i can get proper coverage for just a small amount. It absorbs very quickly and does not feel heavy or oily. I will put this on in the morning and be good all day.My main issue before using this moisturizer was my forehead would dry out in the winter and would have skin flakes. It was particuarly bad after i got out of the shower. Now i just put this on and my skin is perfect.I use this with a combination of cetaphil in the shower and i rarely EVER break out. My skin is very soft and looks amazing.Yes, this is kinda pricey. But a little will go along way. Any more that one squirt and you have too much. So that bottle will last a good while. If you are in doubt, BUY THIS!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The entire Aveeno Clear Complexion line is amazing. This moisturizer in particular is amazing, and I usually can never find it in stores which is why I strictly have to order it on Amazon - which I am not complaining about! This order always arrives literally 2 days after I buy it, and I am in love with how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. I have very sensitive skin with some oily spots and acne..and this cream is perfect after washing my face in the morning and at night. What I love best about this product is that it doesn't make my face more oily, and it keeps my skin feeling refreshed even during the summer. Love it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this because it has soy in it and I know soy helps to even the skin tone. I thought the salicylic acid it contains would help to keep my skin clear as well. But this made my already oily skin appear to be greasy. By mid day if I ran my hand over my face I could see the oil on my hand as well. There is also only 0.5% salicylic acid which really does nothing to control chronic acne.The good points are that the pads are nice and large and it smells nice and lathers up nicely. In fact I continued to use it b/c I liked the way the lather felt on my face, but it just got to be too oily for me so I stopped. If you have dry skin, I recommend it, but I do not recommend it for people who have oily skin and chronic or severe acne."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I cut these in half with a sharp, clean pair of scissors and put them all back in the container. It doubles my use as I found the pads are really big, much bigger than Stridex pads, they are generously full of sudsy product and I felt I was throwing them out half-used before deciding to cut them ahead of time.The salicylic acid is just the right amount to prevent breakouts. The pads have enough texture to give me a good exfoliation, and I usually have enough to clean my neck and chest with the back side. My skin looks great, and if I ever get the slightest blemish, usually around my t-zone, I use an oxy spot treatment with benzoyl peroxide. I find the salicylic acid coupled with the occasional benzoyl spot treatment has become the perfect combination.Remember, cut a few in half and I think you'll find it's still more than enough to clean your face."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I usually break out in the summer. I sweat a lot while gardening and my pores get clogged, especially on my forehead. Since, I've change my skin regimen, my breakouts have been minimal to nil. Here is what I do. 1) Wash my face morning and night, 2) Use witch hazel pads, and then 3) finish off with this moisturizer. I always thought washing my skin too much would dry it out, but it's just fine, and most importantly - pimple-free. Since I am now using this moisturizer as part of my regimen, I guess I will give this product some of the credit. I just re-ordered."}

This does the trick! Makes my face so clear and radiant. I've used it for a week on my combination skin at it's the best cleanser I have ever used.I will have to buy this where ever I spot it because I can't stand the thought of being without it forever.

I finally found a daily facial wash that worked well and didn't completely dry out my skin (causing me to break out more!), but the combination of new skin wash and this moisturizer are what ultimately cleared up my skin.No more redness, and I've had one breakout in the last two weeks since using this. It really makes your skin look even and clear!"}

I do still have dry areas, for which the moisturizer works well. I occasionally get a pimple, and I noticed that the frequency has decreased since I started using this cleanser.One star off for minor reasons: 1) I personally didn't mind this, but my fiance didn't like that the cleanser is so light and foamy. He prefers something more substantial in texture so that he knows he's really getting clean; and 2) after a while, the pump got sticky and lost its spring. Now, after pushing down, I have to manually lift up the nozzle so that I can pump again."}

I normally just wash my face in the shower with neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser every other day.I wear makeup 4 days out of the week for work and wash it off with this or the body shop tea tree oil foaming as soon as I get home.

{"label": 4, "raw": "I got this compact hair dryer to replace the same model, which I'd had for a decade or two but the cord started to wear.

This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I'd liked on my old one. I was so glad Conair still makes it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is by far the worst thing I have ever put in my hair. I have long wavy hair, and I made sure it was dry and brushed before using this product. I put a small segment of hair on the brush (despite the fact that after 30 minutes of heating, it was barely warm), and when I wrapped a strand of hair around the brush twice, I could NOT get the hair out. It tangled and held on to my hair so tightly, I even considered cutting it off! Eventually after 20 minutes of struggle, I was able to free my hair. I immediately returned it to the drug store where I purchased it and even wrote a review on the remaining products on the shelves with a sharpie, directly on the packaging to warn other people (see customer posted images).

Only thing I would have loved to see in this product is a better brush, this brush is not bad at all, but my hair slip out of it while curling as the teeth are smaller than expected. With loner teeth I guess this would be an ideal product for me :)"}

I don't like using a curling iron, but with the clip it does provide more control and has more effect on the hair.Based on the other reviews it does replace that process for many users, but didn't for me.Pros:Easy to useAdjustable heat settingsGood for touch upsProbably not damaging to hairCons:Doesn't provide enough control for thick, coarse hairDoes not seal the cuticle, hence doesn't stop the frizzies"}

It heats up in less than a minute and gives my ends a curl in under 16 seconds on a medium heat setting. The turbo setting works in a few seconds and gives a good heat boost. It will give you a tighter curl. I am done with my hair in under 3 minutes most days.Be careful not to  wind  your hair too many times over the brush or you could get a tangle that is difficult to undo. One or two turns is very safe.My last  curler one kept going for several years and only failed after one too many falls to the bathroom floor.

This travel hairsetter has a small stand on it, which looks pretty sitting in the bathroom, but will take up needed height space making the double sided suitcase difficult to close.  I found on Amazon the Conair MiniPro Hot Rollers and they fit just fine, even in carry-on size. This set will be fine at home and came with claw type clips that hold the roller in place to support a curly set.  This was not written in the Amazon description.  I wish I had known because I spent more money to get clips which I didn't think came with the set."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Good and cheap hair styling product! I tried it today after I blow-dried my hair. It was frizzy and hard to handle at the tips, as always. I looked like a troll. I turned this on and let it warm for a few minutes. I put 2 on each side and one on the crown. After a couple minutes I took them off and voila! Loose, sexy, and effortless Victoria's secret curls (:Would recommend to anyone, unless you're looking for a genuine curl."}

I have medium to dark brown hair and it really turned out fantastic.  However....I've really only been getting about a week of vibrant red before it starts fading despite using mild shampoos formulated for colored hair, without sulfates.  I'm having to recolor every two to three weeks otherwise it's more of a really dark auburn color instead of intense red.  The formula is very strong.... smell is strong and it burns my scalp.  I am hoping to find an alternative to this product with more resistance to fading...the burning scalp thing probably isn't good either...nor is coloring so often.  Good news is that despite very frequent coloring my hair is still in good condition."}

It was literally dripping off my gloves after I put it in my hair.  I never had a problem with any other hair color product and not even by L'oreal.  This formula is way too watery!!!  I never had so much drip to the floor ever before.Always buy the cream kind, or the mouse.

It is dark but not as an intense red as I would hope for. Id say it's more of a dark brown/red. It's more of a natural color. I would use it again if I wanted to make less of a statement and just make sure I used a towel for my hair that I don't mind ruining for a while."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been very discouraged lately at the changes in hair color.  It used to last much longer, and the color was better.  This time I tried Medium Auburn, and it said to leave it in for 20 minutes.  I left it in for  45 minutes just to be sure, and there's barely any color.  My hair is soft and shiny, I'll give it one star for that. But I could get these same results using a deep conditioner, and it is FAR too expensive for that.  I guess I'm going to have to get brave and graduate to henna."}

Darkened it and gradually began going into the reds, professionally.  Really chicken at the thought of having pink hair at 60 :) After a couple of times at the salon, it was time to give it a go.  Began with RA (think that's the number), found it too dark for me then next time mixed that one and 7LA.  Pretty good results, just wanted lighter.Second time doing this one by itself and very happy.  Would prefer a little more red in it.  My hair comes out lighter than the box but all in all, hair is in great shape, very healthy, natural looking color.  I would go for 4 1/2 stars review, just not available.  Again only because I would like a little deeper shade than what I get."}

I chose this brand because the before photo on the box appeared to match my hair the closest and the after photo best matched the shade of blonde I wanted to be. I applied this brand to my hair and it did absolutely nothing. It says on the directions to leave it in for 25 minutes. I wasn't noticing a change so I left it in for an hour. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the conditioner smells amazing and it left my hair feeling very soft. Too bad the dye doesn't work."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this for a few weeks now.  I'm not noticing too much in the &#34;firming&#34; department yet, however I like the cream a lot.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother or irritate it at all.  The smell is pleasant and the cream goes on smooth.  I wake up &#34;fresh-faced&#34; without an oily sheen as I've expreienced using other night creams.  I'll keep watching on the &#34;firming&#34;, but I will definitely purchase this again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Some years ago, I saw that an independent testing lab had rated Olay as the most effective at achieving visible results and had bested competing products costing multiple times as much.  I bought some and was very pleased with the results. This Total Effects Night Treatment was a new product that I wanted to try, and it's difficult not to sound like a contrived television commercial at how impressed I am.  It's nothing short of remarkable how smooth and nourishing it is to my middle age skin, with no irritation or oiliness.  After finishing my first jar and not being able to find it at my local grocery store, I opted for a heavily advertised competing product that they did have. Big mistake and I actually had to return it after just a few days for the disturbing irritation it caused to my skin. Everyone's skin, of course, has it's own sensitivity and chemistry, but for me at least, I can't recommend this highly enough. It does what it says and at a very reasonable price."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using the product for 4 months and have been applying it to my face every night before bed.PROS: Has a nice clean smell, moisturizes very well, makes my skin feel smooth, gets rid of dry spots. Also, a little goes a long way. I still have 1/3 of the product left after 4 months.CONS: Did not tighten/firm my skin whatsover. Did not prevent or smooth out any wrinkles as I noticed new wrinkles over time, and the smile wrinkles I have got worse and are more noticeable now. Lastly, this product made my skin look and feel VERY OILY. I don't like wearing the product around other people as the shininess is embarrassing.This cream is basically good as a moisturizer if you have dry skin, but isn't really good for anything else. I can't say I'd recommend it, but looking at how other people have rated this, there is still a good chance that it could work well for you."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using Nivea's face scrub for years, and I would never consider washing my face with any other product. The scrubbing elements in this product gently scrape the dirt and dead skin from your face, and leave it feeling revitalized and really clean. If your skin is oily, or if you work in a humid or otherwise grimy environment, then you will certainly appreciate this scrub. I use it after taking a shower and/or right before I shave. I feel that even when my face is not particularly grimy, this scrub helps me get a smoother-feeling face that is much easier to shave. Overall, this is a great product that has become and integral part of my personal care arsenal."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm assuming that what they tell you is true and you need to occasionally run sandpaper over your face to strip a small layer off. In that case, I'd recommend this to do it.I only use this once a week or once a fortnight. But when I feel particularly that there's too much skin on my face and I need to strip a layer off I use this. The good thing about it is that it cleans quite well yet does not leave your skin dry. It smells nice without being overpowering. And I only use it before sleep and never after shaving because I think that shaving already strips a layer off your skin.So, cleans nicely, does not leave the skin raw, I recommend it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I didn't like it in the beginning. When I first started using it 2 months ago, my hair felt too dry, like all the oil was washed off my this shampoo. I live in Colorado, and you don't want to make your hair any drier than this State already makes it be. BUT: 2 months later I actually started seeing the change in my overall hair health. I haven't changed my diet or anything, while my hair started looking better and better after every wash. Having extremely fine and thin hair, this shampoo makes it look thicker. Seriously, once I washed my hair with my bf's shampoo, and my ponytail was thinner than my pinkie. The next day I washed it with this shampoo, and the size of my ponytail grew to the size of my thumb:) Believe me, it's a BIG change for me. I can actually see the difference."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Amazing sunscreen! I can't use any other after getting this. Even better testimonial is my husband will actually use this too, and he is one to HATE anything creamy. A very small amount of this goes a very long way. It works too, I burn so easy and for an average day (4 to 5 hours) of being in direct sun outside swimming, I have never needed to re-apply. Never had any sunburn, or even the feeling of being sunburned that most sunscreens leave me with. This really works. It has a nice clean smell too, so great for men or women. Non-greasy, it is a little more massaging to rub it in than most of the suncreens I've used in the past, but nothing to difficult at all. Just rub it in and enjoy your day. You will smell fresh and clean the whole time too. Great stuff!!"}

{"label": 4, "raw": "Absolutely, a miracle nail cream from Barielle. Barielle's reputation stems from this outstanding nail strengthening cream that originally was created to condition the hooves of thoroughbred racehorses; the side affect being that the groomers also developed beautifully strong, peel and split free nails.

Thankfully, that craze is long over; and my nails have benefited ever since by using Barielle. Works well withBarielle Natural Nail Camouflage, .5 fl oz (14.8 ml)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought these awhile back and wrote a favorable review on them, but they seem to have become useless somehow. I used to get nice bouncy curls, but now the rollers don't hold heat and when I unroll my hair it comes out frizzy, fuzzy and kinky. I was shocked because they used to work so well. I've taken good care of my set, I never leave it on or forget to turn it off for long periods, and I can't imagine it wearing out so quickly, especially because I only use them maybe twice a week. I will not be buying another set, I think I'm going with the BabyLiss hot rollers this time.P.S. They only come with three clips."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product didn't work for me, but that's not to say it will not work for you. My issues with this product was that I burned my fingers each time I tried to put the roller in my hair, you only get a few clips with the product and they didn't work very well--At least they didn't work well for me. I gave this product away and even that person didn't want it. I may be a fan of some Conair products, just not this one."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love this hair curler set. I have purchased two of them now, one for each daughter. Both have long, thick hair and we find that it does an excellent job of providing just the right amount of curl for those occasions when you need it. It takes just a few minutes to heat up and the soft velvet lining on the rods make it less damaging to hair.The only thing I always hate is the clips! Even though there is a small case to hold them, sometimes they get lost!  Replacement clip sets would be much appreciated. I think the curler set contains just the right number of each size of roller -- even better though would be to have two ore large ones!!Recommended."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I rarely ever return items because it's such a hassle. But this, is being returned immediately. The idea is actually very good- it has a side heater to heat up the clips as well as the rollers, a feature I've never seen before. However, the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair. No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds. Even when I stayed completely still (very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers) they would still fall out. They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked."}

Perhaps the doors of perception will differ for others, but the jasmine soap has a peculiar odor.While usually a fan of Clearly Natural products, something went wrong here.  I think, frankly, that it smells like poop.  Seriously.  And that's not exactly the \"scent\" I want when taking a shower.  Another person in the family likens it to bathroom cleanser.

I apply it to my face twice a week in the evening and leave it for 45 minutes before washing it off then apply a thin layer of balancing moisturizer (for acne skin).  I didn't even need to use any medication afterwards.  It's noticeable that mask helps the skin to heal from broken pimples or those that were about to develop into big ones.  One of the big plus that come with this product is that it's not too expensive so I strongly recommend it!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this mask for a week. The results have been so impressive that I've been using it at least once per day and sometimes 2. My pores were not huge but they definitely made my skin look older. I can't believe it, the pores on my cheeks are almost completely gone. On top of that even the redness around my nose where I have broken capillaries looks much clearer. It has removed blackheads around my nose that I didn't realize were even there. My entire face looks better and discolorations have diminished. I feel like I've taken a couple years off my face in one week. It's amazing such a fantastic product is so reasonably priced. I will continue to use the product indefinitely. I highly recommend it to anyone with oily skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I know this masque has a cult following in the beauty community, and that is what has inspired me to try it so many times over the years. My skin is very sensitive and while I have used dozens of other clay masques with no issues, the mint oil in this one sets my face on fire. I can't even keep it on for 60 seconds because it is so painful. There have been a few times where I toughed it out and ended up with red, angry, itchy, irritated skin that lasted for days afterwards. This has also caused me to break out, something I have never experienced with another masque. I think most people probably won't have any sort of reaction to this, but if you have sensitive skin I caution you to really think about whether this is a good product for you. At the very least, do a patch test before putting it over your whole face."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this for several years now, probably bordering 6 years. The formula hasn't changed and if it did, I have felt no difference. For the price, this is amazing stuff. You can almost feel the crap being taken out of your pores. When you first apply it, there's a nice tingly, non-painful minty feeling.I use this as both a cleanser and a mask. Works fine either way. My only suggestion is that they find some way for the mask to roll off smoother. I would pay double for that. Right now, using it as a mask and washing it off is a pain."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this item a month ago when I got facial acne which I hasn't been getting for a while. I started with Ole Henriksen blemish serum (costs $45!), which didn't do anything on my acne after 3 weeks of use. I had to search online, and eventually found this magical mask. I have combination skin and I used it as a spot treatment overnight. My acne retreated after only a few days of use. I also used it as a mask once a week. My face is clean and acne free now. This product is so effective plus great price! Who says you need to pay more to get the job done?! Very happy with it! I wish I had known about it in the first place!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For once--a beauty product that actually DOES what it SAYS it does. In just one application, it dried up my t-zone oil slick, shrunk my pores (which are big enough in which to carry loose change), evened out my skin tone, and softened my skin to baby's butt softness. It even seemed to tighten my fine lines. The minty scent is truly refreshing (AND relaxing). The clay texture is soft, smooth, and feels nice going on--very therapeutic. Oh!...and it lasts forEVER....oh!..and it's inexpensive. OH..my God..............I love this stuff.Bottom line: Stop spending ridiculous amounts on more expensive brands with fancy packaging and get something in a butt-ugly package that actually works. Period."}

It feels very refreshing and cooling on the skin. Has a peppermint scent. However, not an overpowering one.Makes my face feel very smooth and clean after I take this off. I use this about 1-2 a week and i really enjoy it. Works wonderfully for me.I recommend this item if your looking for a refreshing masque, that will clean your face, and make you feel very refreshed!"}

I use this mask once or twice a week. It's cheap and works better than some of the expensive masks I've wasted money on, plus you can buy it in most places where you also get your groceries. I will never stop using this. I follow with a light moisturizer that won't clog my pores. Always satisfied with this product...it never stops working after using it for years!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm a big fan of Queen Helene's masks for one particular reason: They're as effective as high end brands, and generally work. This mask in particular is great at evening your skin tone, and shrinking your pores if you use it regularly. I use it at least three times a week, and it makes my skin appear healthy and glowing. I'd also, recommend their other mask,Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, 8 Ounce. It's an excellent mud mask, and its tingling sensation really makes me feel like it's deep cleaning."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've always loved peel-off masques. That's really because I enjoyed the peel-off process. However, I considered them ineffective because the only thing they'd get rid of are my baby hairs at the front, nothing more. But this is one masque that does the trick! I constantly looking forward to applying it and seeing the difference it makes it closing my pores and getting rid of my acne. My face is so much more radiant and alive! This is definitely a product I'm sticking to."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn't remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite.

I left it in the draw with all the other products I don't really use because they do nothing special. I mean really!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This masque feels nice on your skin, but beyond that it had little benefit for me. It certainly didn't help clear my pores, in fact you could see the clay visibly clogging them even after I rinsed the masque off. If your skin is as oily as mine this will not take care of the oil much at all. I felt refreshed right after using it but within a few hours I was back to my normal level of oiliness. Overall, I'm not impressed. There are several other masques around this price point that work much better than this one for my skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love the mint julep face mask from this brand, and I love how cheap these are. However, if you are looking for a mask that purifies and tightens skin, I find it ironic that the mint julep does a better job in these two categories that this one is especially for.When you put the mask on it is super flaky and the dry pieces get everywhere. Make sure to leave it on 5-10 minutes longer than it suggests. My skin felt softer and more moisturized, and I think this would be the better of the two for sensitive skin, but don't buy it to tighten."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I like to switch up my beauty routine and usually mix fruit-based facials for myself, but I like mud as an alternative as well.This is a very good, cheap, basic product to use once a week. It will leave your skin feeling tighter and will give you a glow.I usually exfoliate my face and neck, then apply this for 30 minutes (yes, a little longer than recommended) and after washing it off, I use my night cream (Olay). That combination leaves my skin looking perfect for 3 days+.I recommend it for once a week use for normal to oily skin. If you have dry skin, this may make you feel a little too dry. I have used it on my body (dry skin), and I wouldn't use it there again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love this mask. I have been using the expensive masks since I was early 20s. But this one is much better than the ones cost me over $80.

That afternoon i drove to the store to buy it.How did i live without it.My skin is no longer dry, its soft and i am so happy. Everyone now asks me now what product i used to get such soft skin.

I happen to read the text on the back of the packaging: the second of a list of 4 bullets said \"Lasts through hand washing.\" Of course, if you use strong soap and really scrub, you do have to re-apply the lotion afterwards, but I noticed that even after washing out a glass using dish detergent, my fingers still felt somewhat moisturized. I do apply more lotion but I don't 'have to' every time."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have suffered bad skin allergies and eczema for years.  I only use aveeno to soap my body with.  I don't think I am allergic to scented soap, but the benefit I know I get from Aveeno is that it keeps my skin moist (but not greasy), which is really important if you have eczema.  I also use Aveeno's eczema lotion to pair with this soap and together they keep my flare ups at bay.  I would give this a sixth star if possible because of the price here on Amazon.  It is nearly half the amount than the regular store!"}

The other varieties from Aveeno (with fragrance) I have not liked.  So I use this one and then after I shower I use Bath and Body Works Cucumber Melon lotion for a nice light scent on the skin.

I was miserable not being able to wash my hair until someone told me about No-rinse Shampoo.Small things make a big difference when you are hospitalized/recovering from surgery.  No-rinse shampoo removed one of the things that was making me feel bad and I am so pleased someone told me about it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I tried this. It didn't work for me but it might work for others based on all the good reviews it has on amazon. It's probably only for certain hair types (maybe shorter and less oily hair). My hair gets oily quickly and when I use this the day after a shower, It doesn't feel clean. It leaves a sticky feeling in my hair and it still looks oily. It also weighs my hair down. The only plus is it smells nice. Powder dry shampoo may be another option, but I haven't tried that one yet."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "When our daughter had surgery last fall, she wasn't able to stand long enough to shower, and had gauze dressings that couldn't get wet.  I had been sponge bathing her, but her long hair desperately needed washing.  I picked up a bottle of this no-rinse shampoo at Walmart.I was able to massage it through her hair and then towel it dry, and get a comb through her matted hair.  It did remove most of the oil and made her hair smell better, although of course it wasn't as nice as an actual shampoo.  However, when you don't have a choice about being able to shower, this is a good option.  She felt better just having her hair somewhat clean and brushed after a week of lying there.I would recommend this if you are caring for someone who can't take a regular shower or bath, but wouldn't recommend it for a way to skip shampooing if you're able to shampoo."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried allot of these types of products (should mention I'm a hair stylist & can get many hair products at half price or less) & even the so called \"expensive brand named ones\" to me I hated. They all stunk & looked like I dumped a bottle of baby powder all over my hair. With allot of good reviews on here I decided to give this one a whirl. Loved it! Yes, you do have to lather it until your hair is pretty wet but it WORKS (for me anyways) & I have very fine/kind of oily hair. Sure beats washing it every day & styling it over & over each day. Not to mention doing that every day really drys out & damages it. This doesn't. I recommend it for sure."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I brought this camping and both guys and gals used this.  It smells fresh, like you've taken a shower with regular shampoo, feels refreshing when going on.  The directions say to soak your hair, massage it in and then towel dry. I have a lot of hair but still have a decent amount left (it was used by 5 adults).  It does make your hair look smooth and it does make if feel like there's product in your hair (like gel) but it's much, much better than going without a shower."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have fibromyalgia and there are days when even taking a shower is too much.  Raising my arms over my head for the amount of time it takes to shampoo and condition will make my arms ache for the rest of the day.  This No Rinse Shampoo has been a godsend!  On the days I really must shampoo (I can mist my hair the second and third day after I shampoo), using this is perfect.  It makes my hair fresh and scalp clean.  I don't know how it works without having to rinse it out, but it doesn't leave it feeling sticky or full of residue, either.  It gives me one extra day of rest and that's important for some of us!Tip:  I would shower and shampoo normally the day after using this, however."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this lip color for many years. I like the raspberry shade of pink, the ease of application, the long-lasting color that rarely needs a touch-up. It stays &#34;put&#34; and doesn't run into those lip creases we develop as we age.  My only complaint would be the frequency with which I have to buy the tubes.  Using daily, the color side of the tube honestly doesn't last more than 30-40 days for me.  I always end up with the clear gloss side being more than half full when the color side is empty.  I think more lip color could be gotten from the tube if the applicator was as long as the tube of color.  I always think there is more product at the bottom that I just can't get to with the provided applicator."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried a lot of lip products, but this is the only one I rave about. The color really lasts a long time - like, I'll put it on in the morning and it will still look great at the end of the day. Like I can eat, kiss, drink, and I'm still the only one wearing lipstick. Like, I'll still be wearing lipstick after a shower.It doesn't get stiff or cakey, and I can just add some gloss to freshen it up. The only things I've noticed is that it doesn't work well with Burt's Bees or other waxy lip balms - it can get lumpy if you use chapstick over it.  Gloss seems to be fine. Also, it can be a P in the A to get off at the end of the night, so often I will look extra terrible in the morning if I'm too lazy to scrub at it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For a lip gloss, the pigmentation and staying power is pretty great. Once it dries, it stays put and doesn't feel sticky (no more hair sticking to your lips on a windy day!).Just a head's up: it seems to form a plasticky coating on your lips that tends to peel/flake off, instead of just fade away. If I gently rub my lips together when wearing this, it literally forms little clumps that flake off. I wouldn't recommend this for people who tend to have dry lips. If that doesn't bother you, go ahead and give this a try."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have nothing bad to say about this product. It leaves your skin soft, healthy, moisturized,not greasy and with a very light scent of sunblock.I've been out in the sun a lot since I bought this product and I have yet to get a sunburn on my face even when the rest of my body gets sunburnt(have yet to find a good body moisturizer with SPF).And to make it even better, a little of this product goes a longggg way. The thin consistancy of the product makes it so I need just one small squirt to cover my face and neck, making the bottle last a long time which saves money :)My search for a facial moisturizer with SPF has come to an end with this product :) I love it :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I must admit when I first purchased this product I was a little skeptical because most Eucerin products I have got have been way too rich for my skin even when it claims to be lightweight .  Another reason I was skeptical was because I have never actually seen this product in the store by the other SPF face lotions.  However, I love it.  It is very lightweight and a little goes a long way.  Also the bottle size fits perfectly into my skin care organizer.  I think I will be purchasing this product from now on instead of my beloved Aveeno."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I got this product from Walgreens and it serves all of my needs, it is fragrance free which is great because I don't even realize I have it on during the day (unlike other spf facial products!). It has a great consistency, not too thin and not too thick, so it keeps my skin moist. It is the perfect lotion - it is not greasy and doesn't make your skin look shiny. It doesn't emit fumes into my eyes even when I use it in my eye area. It does make your face a teeny bit whiter than it is because of the ingredients but it's not that noticeable if you spread it well and not leave smudges of it, so I'd definitely suggest checking the mirror after you applied it. Though other people said the pump isn't great and clogs, I never had that problem, the lotion comes out smoothly and easily, and I can put the right amount of pressure to get the right amount I want. I'm very satisfied with this lotion!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I usually use the Q10 w/o the spf and wanted to try the one with spf because I'm starting retin-A but they didn't sell it.. so I decided to give this one a try. I have pretty dry skin. It gets pretty flaky in the winter time so I need something that will moisturize deeply. This face moisturizer penetrates my skin to where it isn't flaky anymore yet it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy/oily. I can wear it under make up and my skin looks super smooth all day. I'm also prone to ocassional break outs and haven't had any problems with them so I like this product a lot. Fragrance free is also a plus."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product feels okay on the skin but leaves a highly visible white film on the skin.  I'm not sure if it is apparent on other races but it is very noticeable on African American skin tones. It looks like I've applied cheap foundation shades too light on my face.I cannot wear it outdoors in front of people during the day (and I'm cheap! :) ) so I use it as my night time moisturizer before bed. Imagine using an SPF moisturizer only to bed...Will not repurchase once I've used it all."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a great value and offers great protection.I have very fair skin and I'm often frustrated when selecting moisturizers... anything above SPF 15 is either expensive or just regular, old sunblock.And then I found this! It's reasonably priced and offers SPF 30. Even more importantly, it's &#34;broad spectrum&#34;, which means it protects from rays that cause sunburn AND wrinkles and cancer. (Although BEWARE: Eucerin's similarly packaged body lotion with SPF 15 is NOT broad spectrum - BAD EUCERIN!)Previously, I used Olay, but couldn't find a higher SPF.I have VERY sensitive skin. Derms always recommend Cetaphil at the bargain end for skin like mine, and that even gave me a terrible rash. Even around the eye area, I'm able to use this moisturizer with no clogged pores or irritation.It's the best I've tried and I've tried all the usual drugstore suspects. I hope it stays on shelves for a long time!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the only sun screen moisturizer that I can find that features the physical combination of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to provide true broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection without potentially harmful chemicals with adverse effects (like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which interfere with reproductive hormones and metabolism). Unlike chemical agents, physical agents are not susceptible to being absorbed into the skin after they are broken down by the sun. The product initially has a white tint, as if it doesn't have very good consistency, but this fades away within several minutes."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have sensitive skin, plus have sun photosensitivity. I've been using this sunbloc for a number of years as a daily face lotion. To make it completely sunproof and long lasting, I use ColorScience sunbloc powder (colorless All Clear, which you can get on the internet) over it and know I am completely protected for an entire day of normal indoor/outdoor activities. (I wouldn't rely on it for waterbased activities or heavy duty sports activities.)Some reviewers have mentioned that it leaves a white film on their faces. It does, but that's not a negative and you shouldn't rub it in to eliminate the film for it is the film that protects you from harmful rays. I always get compliments on my complexion and questions about what makes my skin look so translucent and youthful. The secret is that white film which actually looks attractive if you put a dusting of Colorscience or any regular translucent powder, plus a little powder blush over it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I discovered The Prophet fifty years ago in college and have read it dozens of times since then.  Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy.  If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it.  It doesn't care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.  Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of the best, most inspiring philosophy/poetry books ever written!  I have read it over and over, though never tire of it.  It is a great reminder for what's most important in life and puts everything in perspective.  My favorite 'chapters' are Love, Marriage, Children and The first look. I am a romantic though, so the other chapters may appeal to you more....;-)  Absolutely classic and timeless.  Perfectly stands the test of time. My personal copy is from 1948 and is one of my favorite treasures."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Intrinsically, this book utilizes a flowing a cleaver way to express the ideological interpretations of the author. While, personally, I found nothing profound in the ideologies expressed in the book, I did find it, simply a pleasure to read. Even with the lack of philosophical epiphany, the style of the book in its fluid manner, the parallel structure of the chapters, and the brevity combined with the larger font in the piece, leave the reader, whether they agree with the philosophies therein or not, in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time. As, really, they probably have not, it really did not waste my time anyway; it only took a little over an hour to read (with breaks)."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Gibran Khalil Gibran was born in 1883 in what is now Northern Lebanon.  In 1909 he went to Paris to study, but he did not like the strict education, and so he traveled, eventually moving to New York.  Gibran became both an artist and a writer, and in 1923 he published \"The Prophet\", which is generally considered to be his greatest work.  He died of cancer in a New York hospital at the very young age of 48.The Prophet is a story about Almustafa (The Prophet) who after living 12 years in Orphalese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home.  Before he goes, a group of people stop him, and to them he teaches the secrets of life.  Gibran writes in a very poetic manner, and it is wonderful to read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Okay I know that Gibhran is supposed to be corny and cliched and assosciated with the hippy movement of the 60's.It does not mean that he also isn't still relevant to anyone seeking answers to what life is about. The set up is simple - as a prophet takes his leave of the people with whom he has stayed for many years, he is asked a series of questions, \"tell us of friendship, of love, of work, of death\". And to each question the prophet provides an answer.For me the message that the prophet provides is that life is not easy and that the greatest joys can only be achieved by risking and enduring great sorrow.But that is only what I took from Gibran and his prophet. Read and take your own message from his words."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Khalil Gibran's book, The Prophet, has the power to transform the darkest feeling of pain in your heart into great release. What a blessing that it exists. Each passage touches on a deep and universal topic (marriage, friendship, etc).  The words, spoken profoundly and clearly from the mouth of the mystic and insightful prophet, who has nothing but words of wisdom to impart to those who gather around him, is a truly life affirming and transformative experience.  Please read this today. It will give you insight on the sacred aspects of all life choices and experiences that exist in the world."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When Gibran was first introduced to me, I had definite doubts that his work would be the ordinary, grab a dictionary sort of read. But when you first open to those sections that apply to you, and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears, well, shock is the only word for it. Yes, the ideals and beliefs that he expresses in 'The Prophet' may not be anything new as far as philosophy is concerned, but the perfect blend of brilliant poetry and this simple philosophy come together to make something that is indeed, unique. I've purchased countless copies to the ones that I know will love and understand his words. And if for nothing else, Kahlil's work can be labeled as truly, a literary work of art."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Certainly the words are of Kahlil Gibran, but the eternally PRESENT divine wisdom told through his words is from the source of all sources. Only those who are ready to receive the divine wisdom are destined to read and know the meaning behind the meanings of his words. This is one of the five most valued books that I keep on refering again and again for solace and peace of MYSELF.While writing - or rather while being an instrument to write this book - Kahlil Gibran must have reached the original source of all the knowledge and wisdom available to humankind.Gibran's book is music, poetry, wisdom and truth - all at the same time!I salute Kahlil Gibran for giving us the &quot;THE PROPHET&quot;."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The Prophet dispenses ultimate wisdom to his loved ones as he bids fare well.Khalil Gibran defines all that I never had words to define, or more appropriately, did not have the good sense to define.  I discovered this book a while back and took a long time to read it since I refused to rush through it.  I read it a lesson at a time, understanding it to the best of my ability.I found a way of life in these words.  I could read it everyday and each time these words would dispense a new lesson... like a never ending treasure."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Reading a classic such as &quot;The Prophet&quot; is much more fruitful when it is revisited often, the lessons are applied and the reader reads as if Gibran is writing only to him or her.Sitting with this book in your hands can be like sitting across from Gibran, listening to him speak.  The accompanying art work also by Gibran gives it yet another rich element and peek into the soul of this incredible writer.Listen, embrace and breathe in these words.Open your mind and heart to The Prophet."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book takes different themes such as work, love, etc. and poses them as questions that a community asks a wise man, who seems to be spirit talking. He is a man who is not so much of a religious base but more filled with a love of nature finding peace and depth through sensory and embracement of all dark and light. He is a person who has freedom in all areas of his life and learns from all things and all moments because of his openess and aliveness. He wants all people to gain awareness from their path thru eternity. This can be read in a variety of ways coming from each person's belief system. I read this when I was in a state of loss, loss of so much. This book can bring understanding and a shift in consciousness at least for a spell of time. It can expand who you are while you process and integrate his writings. I most definately recommend this book, for all people on their journey in whatever space they are in on their path of life."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I first became aware of Kahlil Gibran when I read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Ever since then, I have sought out his books.  The Prophet is my favorite.  Several of the  &quot;poems&quot; or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life.  The  book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others.  There is  barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on-love, marriage,  death and all of our own insecurities and doubts about people and life.  This would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough  time, or just has unanswered questions at a certain point in their lives.  The writing is lucid, insightful, and will be relevant for as long as time  goes on.The drawings add to an already great work.  At my favorite Lebanese  restaurant, I not only found good food-I thankfully found Kahlil Gibran."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Gibran was a great author and in this book he truly shines. I recommend this book to anyone, even if he/she is not into reading. The book is short but full of wisdom. I only gave it 4 stars because the idea of the book (and even the title) are taken from \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" which I gave 5 stars. So I didnt think it would be fair to give this one an equal grading. I actually recommend both books, but The Prophet is much easier to read, while Thus Spoke Zarathustra is deeper and more intelligent."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My intention here is to comment on the quality of this reading, rather than the timeless content, the quality of which is well known.I very much enjoyed Paul Sparer's reading. I found his rich bass voice and eloquent style ideal for Gibran and very pleasing to listen to. Unlike another reviewer, I was not at all distracted by the music; in fact, I barely noticed it. Taste in such things is a personal issue, and for what it's worth, this reading very much suits my tastes."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love the Prophet and tend to buy copies to give to people who may need it's message.  I don't ever loan mine out because it never comes back!  This book speaks on all matters human!  I've owned it since I was 14 and go back to it constantly.  I especially love the sections on children, love and marriage.  It's a wonder insightful read and I highly recommend it.  It's also rather spiritual which is lovely.  It's not like the bible, but easy to read and take in.  It can give you peace when you need it.  Please consider adding it to your library."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Pure mastery in words revealing the essence of life. Very simply, this book speaks to everyone. It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe. It brings tears to me each time I read it, because if your mind is open, you will achieve a feeling of higher existence upon completion of your reading. I hope you will take that understanding and infuse it within all you do.I also recommend listening to Richard Harris' reading of this book, though it may be out of print these days."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If I have ever read a book that is timeless, other than the Word of God, it would have to be this one.  Although I may not have agreed with every word written, so many of the words of wisdom within these pages brought peace and comfort to me.I read this book many, many years ago.  I quoted from it at times and thought of it often. The words seemed to wrap themselves around your heart and spring out in times of need. There are not many books that can stake that claim, and I have read many.A classic in my opinion and a book that will never be outdated.Recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I turn to The Prophet for perspective whenever life gets distorted and seems to be on its own track. This book offers poetic and visionary commentary on some of the most vital points of living, and does so in a creative, thought-provoking way. I first learned of Kahlil Gibran and The Prophet during a sermon at a Unitarian Universalist church, and I ran to get the book. It's occupied an important place on my bookshelf ever since. It helps me realize that life is a process, and letting go is a big part of moving forward. It also reminds me to be mindful of how I think about and interact with the world. It keeps things in perspective. The Prophet is an inspirational read."}

Was it Myrtle's utter devotion that kept her there? Why was Potter there? Were they camp followers? Also, did Myrtle bear Georgie and his wife's children for them because the wife couldn't? Or am I dreaming? There seems so much allusion in this book and I feel dumb for not getting what the other reviewers are getting from it.

{"label": 5, "raw": "It's difficult to know quite where to begin here, in the face of such overwhelming praise from so many satisfied readers. It's not that it's badly written, just that it fails to illuminate Master Georgie's life. That after all should be its purpose, particularly where, as here, that person existed and at least one of the events described took place. The author is content to conjure up others to act as prisms, which would be a useful literary device if they illuminated the central figure, but instead we see him through a glass darkly. I may be in a minority of one, but it failed to live up to my expectations."}

In our book club we chose to read Master Georgie.This was a great disappointment. We should have asked for advice on what books to read. The book was nominated for the Booker prize in 1998, but did not win the award.While there is an interesting historical episode as the background, and there were different viewpoints, the reader never feels that this is a book that must be read. At times it seemed disjointed. There were narratives from different characters, but that style did not feel the gaps. Different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives. This did not happen.So need to read other books to appreciate the greatness of Beryl Bainbridge"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "In a revolving first person narrative, three people who are close to George narrate the events of their mid-nineteenth century life. These narrations center around photographs taken at certain points. Through the course of the novel the idea of an image taken is made increasingly more complex as is the mystery of George who is most often portrayed idealistically as a man of high knowledge and wisdom. Through the carefully written language of the narrative, there are surprisingly human incidents and facts revealed that are startlingly human. These are placed in the frame of the historical context leading to the war between England and Russia. The gruesome events of the war that follow strip each of the three characters of their pretence and leaves them yearning for the image of their lost ideal, Master George. This is a fascinating experiment in looking at ways of perception, the identities they fashion for people and the personal impact of assumptions about other people's identities."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It is amazing how some writers can blather on for hundreds of pages and yet be barren of memorable phrase or image, yet how a select few demonstrate the maxim of &quot;less is more.&quot;  Beryl Bainbridge and  her most recent novel Master Georgie surely fall into this latter category.  Each chapter in this short (190 pages) novel takes its title from a  picture illustrating its contents.  This is an effective technique, as the  photographic image provides both a jumping-off point for Bainbridge's  particular scene and narrator (the novel is given from several points of  view) and a framing device for the scene. I look forward to more of her  fiction."}

The first half about Grania's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective, even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling.  As far as the second half, I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI, and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions.  I didn't see how it added to the story at all, and at this point in the book I really wished I wasn't reading it, but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened, and I felt that the ending was a let down.  Mostly, I feel that this topic could have been really, really engrossing, new, and compelling, but the book's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat.  I won't recommend this book."}

I enjoyed it, you can read it bit by bit and look for certain information or you can go cover to cover.  An easy read.  It doesn't answer all my questions but at this point, I don't think anything will :)Also - fast shipping and a great price."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I am continually puzzled by the publishing industry's \"prizes.\"  This book takes up an astonishing amount of shelf space in book stores.  Cover to cover there is nothing in it.  It is like reading a cut and paste book.  The characters are thin, flavorless, cliched, sleep-inducing.  The same with the dialogue.  I am still trying to determine what the author's purpose was, unless it was to bore us to tears (those would be the only tears shed).  I felt like it was written by an automaton, someone who does not care about the craft of writing but thinks she is precious.  There is no strength to the story or the sentences.  I actually felt insulted by this drivel.Read The Deptford Trilogy, by Robertson Davies.  Now there is a circus story you won't forget."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I cannot begin to explain how much I have fallen in love with this novel.  I've never been so entertained, intrigued, horrified and ultimately satisfied by a book.  Each character had so much to offer to the story.  I slowed down as I neared the end knowing I had to say good-bye to Jacob, Marlena and Rosie (the smiling elephant!).  I will definitely go to the nearest bookstore and give Gruen's earlier novels a try.  This is by far the best book I have read in a long time.  I am recommending it to everyone I know!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was the first ever book that i had read, when i first got my kindle. To put it simply it a good nice read. The story line is nice the characters are well developed and have strong qualities. Really theres nothing i could put in words what this book mad me feel. Thats what i look for in a good book. How the story makes me feel how the characters an i respond emotionally towards on an other. When i read i feel as i the story comes to life. And thats what i got out of this book the story came to life so freely and beautifully and th characters showed so muh emotian so much heart that what really made it special. So do yourself a favor and read this book"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm going to be careful here, because I don't want to spoil anything for potential readers.  Let me just say it is a great book, sometimes disturbing, but often funny and charming, or filled with action.  It also has a good bit of grit and tenacity in the main character.  It is a look inside a unique community that you wouldn't get a chance to view this close if you weren't being \"escorted\" by  one of their own.  You may be tempted to stop reading at some point if you are an excessively tender soul, however hang in there.  All you need to know for now is this, it is a fresh well-written book that you will love and ends in a good way so, have no fear of it and enjoy."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have not seen the movie and was not sure how I'd like a book about the circus but a lot of people recommended this novel and it got great reviews so I gave it a try. It was beautifully written with vivid imagery. How could you not fall in love with Jacob? How could you not be enterained with the stories about the circus? How could you not be enthralled with Marlena and Jacob's secret love? I really enjoyed reading it, in fact I could not put it down and it only took me a week to read it. I think this is a story anyone could enjoy, and the author did an amazing job with her research about everything from the circus to the prohibition. The parts about the old man got kind of depressing but there was a happy ending for all at the end. Highly recommended. Lovely read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I understand some of the criticism, but does a book have to be a literary masterpiece to be immensely enjoyable?  The overwhelming positive reviews explain why not.It is well researched, but maybe the plot stretched a bit too far at times and low quality dialogues have taken away from the book's otherwise star quality.The depression era was well represented, gave a good realistic feel of the troubled times and the people.  Circus setting was pure genius, and made it so interesting.Overall, it is a very enjoyable book, very readable."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a well told, interesting story.  It  belongs in the historical fiction genre; the subject is the travelling circuses which tried to make a financial go of it during the Great Depression.  It is not a pretty picture, but as in much of historical fiction, it has a virtuous hero, and a very upbeat ending.  It also has an added dimension: the story is told by the hero as he resides in a nursing home, and suffers from the condescending  attitudes toward the patients there.  This aspect of the book was particularly good, and for me the most genuinely moving.  For that reason, I wish the author hadn't felt the need to give even this sub-plot such a \"nice\" ending."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book when it first came out, because of the exceptional reviews I read.  I have never finished this book.  I started it, shelved it, read three books, went back to it and I just could not foster up enough interest to continue reading.  The story line is uninteresting and the characters were dull. I finally accepted that I would not likely ever to read it; so I tried to sell the book back to the store. The book store did not accept it because this item was not moving from the shelves!  It was definitely not worth the money I spent on this item."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've had this book for two years and only just read it last week.  Why did I wait so long???  This truely is a gem.  You feel like you know all the characters, and the ones you don't know so well are introduced with enough hints and inuendos that you can easily imagine their colorful pasts.  I fell in love with the elephant.  She brought a wonderfully odd twist to the story.And as for the author, I was half way through the book before I paid attention to the jacket picture and realised that it was a female. She wrote exactly as a man would tell the story.  The elderly Jacob was perfectly portrayed.  She has obviously been around very old people and knows how they act and react to all kinds of situations.I truely did not want the story to end."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A friend recommended this book and I was thoroughly engulfed in it from the beginning. Such raw, real life and survival during the depression era. Jacob is a wonderful main character who is thrust into a world, grieving and desolate after his parents sudden death leaves him with nothing. The story is told by him as an old man of 90 or 93 as he says and is truly blunt on how our elders are treated in nursing homes and devalued as human beings. But, the wonderful, painful and thrilling story of his life, his love and his journey after his parents death lands him in a circus is spellbinding.Just know that the ending will make you smile and cry and feel joy for Jacob!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I bought it for my Kindle, but it sat there for months as I wasn't in my \"literary\" phase.  I finally decided to give it a go, and was so incredibly surprised!  I LOVED this story!  It was filled with so many emotions and the characters are depicted in such a vivid fashion, I could picture them so clearly!  They stayed with me for quite some time after completing the book and that rates VERY high with me.  I even got my husband to read it and he loved it as well.  I really couldn't put it down until I knew just what happened to everyone....and the ending?  AMAZING!!!!  I cried in joy, fulfillment, closure and sadness!  Wonderful read!-Just My Opinion [...]"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This novel tells the story of a man who is now old and struggling with health problems. A carnival comes to town and he remembers the amazing life he once had. I loved the ending the most and hated when characters died. The story itself was believable and the characters complex. This book is not for children and can leave you quite depressed at certain points. Other than that [and that's more of an observation than a complaint] this is a solid read. If the characters didn't die this would've been a 5."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Wow!  I picked this up to read on the airplane to & from Las Vegas.  I wound up finishing it while on my trip.Gruen is a wonderful story teller, you can tell she researched extensively for this novel.  While it's not a book really about a circus, that is the main setting for most of the book.  I really thought it would be a book all about Carnie Folk.  How far from the truth was I?!The story is told from the view of an ageing circus vet, which is different to begin with.  One would think that these types of stories would be told from performer's points of view & while that would be interesting, Jacob's POV is just as intriguing as another other's would have been.It's a great short read that's captivating & spellbinding."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First I must mention that I love books that take you to a time and place that you have no knowledge about and in this case it's circus life in the first half of the 1900's. It was fascinating to read what life was like in those days for those who worked in the circus, from performers to the labors. As for the book itself I did enjoy it, but I wouldn't call it a page turner and often in the first quarter of the book I thought about just putting the book down and starting something else a little more exciting to read. However the farther into the book I got the more I started to care about the characters the more invested in the book I became. In the end I was very glad I continued to read the book and now I can say I would recommend the book to friends."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I can't say I have ever read a book that was even remotely similar in plot or storyline. Water for Elephants is one of the most original novels that has ever graced my eyes. I felt all the emotions Jacob did as I read, and the story seemed to transition seamlessly between the present, and his memories without being confusing as some other books can be when they try the memory flashback thing. It's one of the few books that I read that I simply could not put down, stopping only to eat and sleep."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This novel made me want to meet someone who had worked on a circus before.  The prologue is all I read in the store and I immediately felt the need to buy it because of the mystery.  The book is filled with exciting storylines that will capture your attention and keep it there throughout the story--hoping that the storyline will end as you hoped.When you get to the part in the book that the prologue mentions, the actual outcome will surprise you. The animals all find a way into your heart and the characters are all worth remembering and holding on to.  I recomend this book for anyone interested in historical fiction or even science fiction because while it revolves around reality, a cirus, the way that it is written almost feels like science fiction."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I don't read fiction.  A snob journalist, I believe my time is better spent reading non-fiction. Due to reasons I won't bore you with, I picked this book up and thumbed through the first couple of pages, just to see if the writing was any good. I didn't put it down. Read it through to the finish. (The last time this happened with me and fiction was fifteen years ago with \"Boy's Life\" by Robert McCammon.)Sara is a wonderful storyteller with an engaging narrative style, and Jacob is a colorful character with whom to build a story around.So, if you're a non-fiction snob like me or a fiction addict like my wife, you can't go wrong with this book. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The story line is simple, man meets girl, falls in love and must get past all obsticles in the way of their love BUT I loved the descriptions of all the characters, time and events. ie.traveling circus. I do not think the idea was so original.ie boy meets girl, ect. but the research that the author put into the circus idea was just great. I actually felt like I learned something about a life I would never had even thought to learn anything about. I would definatley look for more titles from this author because her research and time put into her characters and themes is fantastic."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was extremely happy with every aspect of this book until, in one of the final chapters, when Uncle Al tells Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic, or as he puts it, a \"paragon schizophonic\".  After reading this, there seemed to me to be simply too many similarities with an older novel I read in 2006, William Styron's modern classic SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  A beautiful Catholic woman and a handsome Jewish man who fight a lot due to the man's schizophrenia, another younger man who is new to their 'group' who has feelings for the woman...sex...death...the only dfference seems to be the circus setting and the fact that in this, the woman DOESN'T die and ends up married to the new, younger man.  A nice book, but not extremely original, at least not in the romantic storyline."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What took me so long to discover this book?  I hadn't heard about it from anyone, just found it during a \"browse.\"  I've been looking for a good read for so long and \"Water for Elephants\" was right there the whole time.  I can't wait to read Sara Gruen's other books and when I finish them, her new one should be available.  She brings to life the good, the bad and the ugly of the circus world and her characters are vivid and full of life.  I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and falling in love with the main animals.  I couldn't wait to get to the next page...and the end was worth the whole trip.  For me it was one of those books that I was sorry to finish.  Thank you, Sara Gruen, for the beautiful journey."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First of all, Sara Gruen tells a really good story. People and animals both have their moments. What most impresses me though is her ability to show the feelings and memories of an old man. Once old, we tend to forget that the old man in a nursing home was once a part of exciting and dangerous events.To me, the viewpoint and dialogue of Joseph at 90 (or 93) really makes this book.Give it a read.And now the point of the Audio review:  If you like the book then you will find the unabridged audio a real treat. The reader captures the characters and takes you right along. We have listened to the story twice and still appreciate the skill of the reader and the beauty of this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I started reading \"Water for Elephants\" on a Saturday night and before I knew it, I had read half the book in one sitting. Sara Gruen's protagonist Jacob Jankowski, carries you through the novel - both as a twenty-three year old who just walked out of his Vet exams and onto the Circus arena and as ninety-three year old man stuck in a nursing home. Gruen's flawless ability to capture Jacob's voice both as a young and old man are is one of the many strengths of her talents. The storyline, which is composed of coming-of-age, love and well a circus will draw you in and keep you till you eyes read over every last word. \"Water for Elephants\" is a brilliantly, well-written and engrossing story that will appease to both men and women alike."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book! I found it very easy to read and get lost in the story. I liked how it was told from present-day Jacob's view looking back on his life. This helped me understand what type of man he was. I felt like I was there will him throughout this story. The setting of the Great Depression made the struggles and triumphs mean so much more. I found all the main characters; Jacob, August, Marlena, Walter, and even the elephant, Rosie, to be extremely poignant, especially when you remember the story is told from an elderly Jacob. The transitions from \"memories\" to \"current day\" Jacob were very smooth and I didn't feel distracted or lost during these changes. If you love a romance novel with hero and heroine, then you must read this book!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When I downloaded this book, I honestly didn't expect much more than a nice way to pass some time.  I really underestimate this little gem.  Once I picked it up I found it hard to put down.  In fact, I stayed up past my bedtime to finish it, but it was worth the extra cup of coffee I had to have the next morning.Without going into any details about the story itself (there's more than enough other reveiws to do that), I'll start by saying I was almost immediately endeared with the main charachters, which is a testament to the writing abilities of the author.  I laughed and cried with the characters, and was genuinely sad to see some of them go.While the ending was more than a little predictable, it was still a good read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What can I say, this book moved me. I saw the movie and put off reading the book, the movie wasn't bad but didn't inspire me to start reading.  Wow, am I glad I did! The transitions from depression time to the present left me breathless. The expertly told story played with all my emotions.  Left me with a renewed appreciation for the difficult times my parents and grandparents grew up in, yet made me want to experience them.  I couldn't put the book down until finished then I went to my computer, looked up old circus pictures and finally bought tickets to Ringling Brothers Circus later this summer."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I used to love to read, however it has been ages since a book has captured me like this one did. The description of characters is both dear and terrible at times.  The description of the life with the circus in this time in history is fascinating. Not really for young readers, it is a bit lusty in some areas but not offensive to me. I have not experienced the movie yet, it will be a challenge to capture the quality of this  book.  I look forward to reading more of Sara Gruen novels."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is simply just a wonderful book!The characters are well defined, each and everyone of them!  You care, you like, you love, you hate!The story unfolds with Jacob, at 91 or 93...he is not sure, and his life.Schooled in vetinary science, he finds himself adrift after the loss of his parents and any financial stability.  He joins the circus and meets a cast of characterS like no other.His love for Marlena, his ultimate choices and growth...the paths taken...andThen...he is 91 or 93...just read it...I can't wait to see the movie...it will be magic!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a tremendously fun and interesting read... not to mention educational too. The whole travelling circus/sideshow thing has always fascinated me, so it was interesting to find a novel with that as it's backdrop. The characters felt very real and I found myself reading far past my bedtime because I wanted to see what was going to happen next.The only dissapointing part of the book to me was at the very end. I can see how some people like things to be tied up in a nice little bow, but to me it was so implausable that it almost ruined the whole reading experience."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story line captivated me from the first chapter.  It had ALOT of swearing and graphic sexual content which I didn't enjoy having to wade through and skip over.  I didn't think it added anything to the storyline, and felt that it could have been left out all together.I found the author commentaries at the end to be most fascinating.  It was interesting to read that the story line has some non-fiction events weaved into it.  I you don't mind filthy language and sexual content this is a great read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Nothing about this book appealed to me.  Not the subject matter, nor the title, nor the cover.  Pfttt.....nothing. A depression-era traveling circus?  What could be more....depressing?  My sister delivered into my hands one day and said, \"Read it.\"  And I did.  I read it while cooking. I read it while eating.  I read it when I should have been sleeping.  I read and read and wanted to read more.  Now I hand it to you and say, \"Read it\".  You won't be sorry."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Others have reviewed the store line much more in depth and better than I can here. I loved this book. Once I started reading it, I didn't put it down. This is not a silly little beach read as it has been touted. It is more in depth than that.The characters were believable. They didn't do anything that was totally out of character once their basic personality was developed. The setting was realistic and interesting and a vital part of the story. The ending was surprising.Very well written. Very interesting. Worth the time to read and worth the money.Enjoy."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants presents a story of a veterinarian's life told from both his present and earlier life perspective.  The way that the author switched between time periods was entertaining.  I found myself experiencing a wide range of emotions from horror to curiosity to anger and then to happiness.  I personally have never been to a circus so I don't have any memories of my own to go by.  However, the author's descriptions of the circus atmosphere and \"class\" system within the different groups makes it very easy to imagine just how life was living on that train traveling from town to town.  I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to the film version."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was very moving for me.  The way Gruen writes about the older character seemed so very well done.  Even though I am not old, I felt older reading those passages.  Gruen moves back and forth from present day to the past very smoothly and it is always a seamless transition for the reader.  Great story, good characters, loved Rosie the elephant. Very thought provoking and I really adored the old carny photographs sprinkled throughout the book.  Never thought I would enjoy a depression era book, but this one was really well done."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed this book a lot, despite the fact that some of the stuff said doesn't match the era in which it was written. I wasn't as bothered by the small issues as some of the other reviewers were, apparently. It is a work of fiction after all. Sure, there were quite a few cliches, but not to the point of distraction. I liked the animals and their personalities, namely Rosie, the star of the show. She stole my heart and when she was a victim of violence, my heart broke for her.Having the old man relive his memories of the circus was very compelling and tied the story of then and now together nicely. The ending made me cry, but not why you'd expect."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was suggested to me by a friend and I wasn't sure I would like it. As soon as I started reading I couldn't put it down.  In fact, I read it in about a week.  This particular book earned it's place on the New York Bestsellers list for a reason.An elderly man, looking back on the past and how it has shaped him now.  The book is set in the present day as well as the early 1930's.  It paints the picture of exactly what I would think a traveling circus would be during that time.  It is full of drama within in the reigns of the circus as far as the everyday workers, performers, and animals. From cover to cover the reader does not know exactly what to expect.  I would suggest this book to anyone.One of the best books I have read in some time.  I can't wait to see the movie!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm not a real fan of fiction, only because fiction does not keep me tuned in to the story line. Often the subject matter rambles on before the story line gets going when  you finally know what you are reading about.Water for Elephants is a well written novel. The title fascinated me to begin with, and excerpts led me to believe this was going to be a good read. I was right!  The story line is never boring, it's uncomplicated, and keeps you tuned in to events as they unravel. So well done. I encourage anyone who is an avid reader to buy a copy. You won't be disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This really is an excellent book with an interesting story and well-conceived details.  I listened to the audio version, which was particularly well acted.  My complaint with the book is that it is blatantly anti-Jewish.  The circus leaders, who are described as Jewish, are mean and spiteful, making the lives of the workers a living hell.  Why did Ms. Gruen need to assign a religion to them? I found this really offensive, and played into negative Jewish stereotypes.  My other complaint with the book is that the two Jacobs don't seem like the same person (I'm assuming they are although I'm not quite finished with the book).  One is loving and mild-mannered, the other cantankerous and bitter.  Can these really be the same person?"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Like many who were critical of this book, I truly did want to love it. However, the writing was simple and flat, the characters lacked depth or conviction and the ending was a huge let down. Jacob was infuriating as he claimed to love these animals and then becomes sexually sidetracked while his Rosie was being beaten half to death. It made me sick to my stomach. Over and over, he continued to behave like a helpless child while this animal was brutalized. Time and again, he is either incredibly violent or he is impotent and seemingly defenseless. In the end, each conflict is suddently and hastily resolved with little authenticity. What a shame as this could have been a deeply moving and engaging story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "this author is a master story teller and she had me from the first.  The structure of the book is captivating, back and forth from the nursing home where the main character lives out his old age to the fascinating life he has led as a veternarian for the circus and his love affair with the main act.  and that is only the beginning.  It is the story of coming of age in a most unconventional setting.  I learned so much about the inner workings of a circus.  So why oh why did the author end the book on such a maudlin, unrealistic note.  Sarah Gruen forced a happy ending on a story that deserved a more intelligent finale.  Still it is deffinately worth the read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed this book as evidenced by the fact that it only took me a few days to read.  The characters are engrossing and realistic.  It is amazing that Sara was able to write the part of an old man with such realism. When I read a book, I also like to learn well researched real facts. This book did not disappoint in that area. The history is interesting and accurate.  The end of the book is satisfying.  If you would like to \"get lost\" in a great book, this is a good choice."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was a bit hesitant about reading this book, I kept reading that it was about circuses, and I really didn't think I had too much of and interest. Boy was I wrong. It starts with a murder and winds and weaves you through the story of life in the traveling circus and back to present day in a nursing home.  The book had my attention from page one and still has me even though I finished reading it. There is humor, love, murder, and friendship, and a whole lot of history about the circus, and circus life making this book a well rounded engaging read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I started reading Water for elephants after watching the movie trailer. I loved it and after going to the cinema I have to say that the novel is really really better. There are more elements than the love story the movie tells. The historical period is described well, the characters are more interesting and Jacob's everyday life is one of the best descriptions of what an old man thinks and feels when he is far from his family.It's an amazing book and even if you're not an english native speaker (as I am) it's an easy read"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a well-written, cute story.  I certainly achieved the `suspension of disbelief' that one looks for in a summer novel.  I empathized with the main character, and could picture him and the others.  I feel like I know Jacob Jankowski - both the younger version in shock from losing his parents, and the older version who hates being treated like an \"invalid\".  Unlike some reviewers, I am not old enough to remember the circus coming to town on the train and with a parade.  In fact, the circus experience from my childhood was in a large concert venue.  Nevertheless, Gruen allows me to imagine the big top in all of its grimy glory and picture all of the alcohol loving workers and performers smuggling their drinks on the train.  What a nice escape."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "\"Water for Elephants\" is a good read.  The writer confesses to being thrilled to be writing something besides technical documents, and this gives rise to minor annoyances, some as trivial as the overuse of \"stare\".The contrast of mores of the Depression Era to modern day is arrestingly authentic.  Using 1930's circus lingo is misleading (a \"bull\" elephant named Rosie).The symbolism that is not overtly contrived (the big circus in the sky) is captivating, but there is an the almost desperate struggle to parallel the narrator with the biblical story of Jacob."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "While I don't completely regret reading this book about a young man who joins the circus as a vet in the 1930's, in hindsight I defintely would have chosen another book. It starts off with a bang, then slows down significantly in the middle, and it ends quite nicely. It's your typical boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl story. I did enjoy the historical fiction aspect of it and I truly enjoyed the final portion of the book where the author writes about why, how, and what she did to write this book.I'd recommend it to the causal reader, but a more sophisticated reader may want to look elsewhere."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Loved every bit of this book. The narration is well-planned...we follow Jacob Jankowsi, a would-be vet with his father until his parents are killed in a car crash. Jacob hits the road, and one night jumps on a train. Little does he know that that one jump will change his life forever--for the better and the worst.Gruen delights readers with circus life during the depression, with strong character development and a strong plot. You root for the animals, who are heinously mistreated by the ringmaster, and you root for the workers."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was pleasantly surprised by this story.  Granted, it had wonderful reviews here on Amazon, but there have been other popular fiction novels with the same reviews, and I loathed those books.I don't need to go into any details as the book has been so thoroughly reviewed, but I will say there was so much in the book that touched me.  Ninety or ninety-three year old Jacob's story was so emotional...it's going to stay with me for quite awhile.  Bravo!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is the story of Jacob Jankowski.  After a tragic accident involving his parents, Jacob feels lost and unsure of his future.  One night he hops a train - only to find that he's hopped a circus train.  Because he is \"almost\" a vetrenarian they welcome him aboard (although not that nicely or easily) and he quickly becomes embroiled in a very predictable love triangle.Gruen does a great job with the transition from the ruminations of 93 year-old Jacob in the nursing home to 22 year-old Jacob on the traveling circus.  They're seemless and very well done.  Reading about the circus and life on a traveling circus during the depression era was also interesting.My complaint with the novel lies in the fact that as a reader I felt the author just skimmed the surface with this novel.  The story was predictable and shallow, and while the characters were decently developed, the overall story line just wasn't that great, IMHO.I was disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed this book very much.  Full of detail and things I would have never suspected or imagined about a circus.  I must admit that I had some trouble with the scenes of animal (and even people) abuse but was able to skim quickly over it enough to get the picture but not dwell on it.  I know that this part of the book had to be told because I'm sure that it happened.  I did enjoy the animals (and people) revenge at the end greatly!  I especially loved the weaving of Jacob's story from old man to young and back again.  And of course the happy ending...well who could have asked for a better one.  Yep!  I loved this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have owned this book for a few months. I keep getting side tracked by other books so I did not read it. Last week so many people told me how wonderful the book was and even the movie. SO, I picked it up last night and am almost done with it. WOW!!! What a wonderful story. You can tell a lot of research went into this by the accuracy. While I know very little about circus life I do work with the elderly and that is all accurate. A lot on the lines of \"The Notebook\" the way the story in told."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Page after page this novel is filled with interesting facts, experiences and history. That it's a memoir of a patient/resident of a nursing home is a literary vehicle of genius. How remarkable to live the life of a this young man, one we can easily identify with, through this period of American history (30's, 40's) only to end up with him in a current-day nursing home, the finest of which are lonely places indeed.My wife and I just recently visited an uncle who lived in a very fine nursing home in another state and were pronounced \"saints\" by the staff who said no one ever visits these people. That's why I'm haunted by the ending of this book.I've also paid more attention to stories of the intelligence of elephants, their almost human sense of justice. Perhaps I mean their more-than-human sense of justice.A wonderful book. You will be glad you read it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants offers some thing for everyone.  If you're a pragmatist you will love the research and facts concerning the circus of the depression era.  If a romantic, the ending will be for you. If you are young, the choices and frustrations suffered by Jacob will be yours. For me, a senior citizen, the gerentology  added greatly to the story.I thought it a great read especially since there are 70 years between the youth and aged of the story which is told in flashback form. There is little in common between the two periods of time except for love and the anticipation of all ages.Try it, you will like it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is loaded with interesting words because Sara Gruen owns a commanding vocabulary, and utilizes her well-chosen words with precision.  She also understands how to set the hook and carefully reel her reader in.  She's a master angler.The story is entertaining and the setting--a train circus-- is interesting.  Obviously Gruen heavy research is what birthed the rich detail.While some call this a romance book, the romance is lacking and rushed.  This is more of an action-adventure \"who done it.\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was given this book to borrow -- \"It is just a wonderful book.\" I cannot stand mediocre writing, and for this reason I don't often read popular fiction. I pushed into it, however, hoping for the best. Just could never care at all about the characters. The old guy is grumpy and resentful. Some of the circus behind-the-scenes reporting is interesting, but much of that is pretty low-life and tawdry. Not for me. I will read the ending and report back to my friend, but I will not read the rest of it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My hatred for this book knows no bounds. This is the trashiest thing to infiltrate the literature section of the bookstore since Henry Miller. (Although I'm not a Henry Miller expert, I'm guessing he at least brought some literary merit to the table, which is more than I can say for this author!) The depression-era circus setting, although intriguing, was not enough to make up for the endless vulgarity, flat characterization and vapid dialogue. And, to make matters worse, no character, at least from the ones I can remember, is spared horrific scenes of physical abuse - you name it, woman, worker, elephant, dog, clown. I just got tired of it all after a while.Why did I even bother to finish it? It was sort of like watching Ripley's Believe it or Not to see what kind of ghastly thing would happen next. Well now I believe it; this is one of the worst contemporary books I've read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of the most fun books I have read.  From page 1 all the way thru. I have laughed out loud at so many points and then sad at others. This is a fantastic read. I usually don't like to read women authors, Tess Gerritson and Alex Kava are the exceptions, but Sara has done a great, great job. I can hardly wait now to see the movie. I hope Sara had a lot to do with writing the movie script.  So many really good books stories are ruined when it comes to be a movie."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Interesting book that makes you want to keep reading, but in the end, it seems like the author tried too hard to wrap things up and make everyone happy.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated.

{"label": 5, "raw": "We find ourselves in the beginning at a nursing home with the elderly Jacob Jankowski's.  When the circus comes to town We begin to find out that Jacobs memory is still there and he takes you back to an era in the Great Depression.As a young man Jacob's life gets upended and he finds himself on a circus train.  They realize that Jacob with his training to become a vet will be of some use to the circus.  He falls victim to the ups and downs of life on the circus train and the beauty of the main act Marlena.  And falls in love with the larger than life Rosie, the Elephant.  Everything and everyone is subjected to the mercy of the cruel circus boss and Marlena's husband.This story is really engaging.  I personally found myself laughing at the antics of the circus family, cringing at the reality of the cruel act of red lighting.  And furious when the circus bosses cruelty reached horrifyingly to everyone and everything."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I found this book to be a very touching story with an interesting setting. The time period, the place, and the characters come to life in this wonderful story.  I don't want to give too much away but if you enjoy a book that makes you feel as though you are there...this is one!  There were times while reading this I wanted to throw a few punches, and other times I wanted to stand between August & Rosie, and times I just wanted to pat the hand of the older Jacob.  I'm sorry I finished this book...I will miss these characters."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really enjoyed this book!  I enjoyed the imagery of the circus and the settings, the historical facts of both the Great Depression and circuses during that time period, and I enjoyed learning more about circuses and the treatment of circus animals overall!There were parts that were disturbing - the mistreatment of circus animals, the mistreatment of circus employees, and the abuse of the lead woman.  But, overall, the plot was engaging and unique.  I especially enjoyed the flashback moments of the present lead character and his reminiscence of the past.  Make sure to read the Prologue! - it adds to the artistic nature of the writing style.I haven't seen the movie yet - hope it's as good as the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book is very enjoyable from beginning to end. It starts with a narration in the present and weaves in events from the narrators past. The style is fluid and non pretentious, engaging for its simplicity and character development. This book feels real when it presents its characters and you can't help but get entwined with the sentiments they live. I haven't seen the movie but I'm glad I read the book first. The story revolves around Jakob a retired circus vet which relates how he came to be involved in the circus world of the 30's and all he lived through while the show went on. The story depicts life through the depression, prohibition and society as a fitting background for the storyline."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Wow.  This book was just spectacular.  I tore through it (it grabbed me and would not let go).  How many books do you see a fifteen-year-old (my niece) reading while walking up stairs?  She could not stop reading it to climb the stairs!  It was an amazing ride.  I cannot imagine that ANYONE would not love this book.I read two of Sara Gruen's earlier books and this is in a different category - a tour de force, an absolute must-read.  What a lovely book.  You end up feeling grateful to her for writing it just so you could read it.  I cannot say enough about how great this book was - an enthralling story, enthrallingly told, absolutely marvelous."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Reading a good book is a chance to run off with the circus--to escape into a fun and exciting world totally unlike one's own. This is Gruen's gift to her readers. I got completely absorbed in the double stories of the old man in assisted living and the young man in the circus. By starting her book with the reflections of an old person looking back, this novel reminded me of Evening as well as Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. The black-and-white photos add a lot too. The historic photo on page 70 of the so-called gentleman \"freak\" is shocking, isn't it? A fast-paced enjoyable book.--Carol Weston, author of Melanie Martin novels for children and teen advice booksGirltalk Fourth Edition: All the Stuff Your Sister Never Told You."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book surprised me.  I usually don't read the summaries on the book jackets because I find that it spoils the story for me and so I didn't really know what to expect from this book.  However, by the end of the book, I was thoroughly fulfilled.  I loved the author's insight into seeing things from the perspective of the \"90 or 93 yo\" main character.  I found I couldn't put the book down once started.  I also liked the Q&A commentary at the back of the book telling how the author researched circus life - especially the story about Rosie - to include in the novel.  Great storytelling!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Take a chance and read this book.  It is wonderfully written.  Such an interesting book to take the lead character and having him in a nursing home, thinking of his life... and what a great life.  What a heart warming story.  I'm fascinated by the freakish carnivale life, and this didn't disappoint (but uphold) that theory!  If you're in for an uplifting tale of struggle and happiness in an unexpected way, you've found the perfect all-around book.  Enjoy!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Frankly, all of the good things have been said about this book by other reviewers. I can only thank Public Radio that had a review of it. Otherwise I would not have heard of it.One of the things that the book points out is how tough life was during the depression.  American today have no concept of what it was like for people who earned no money, had no money, and had no place to go. There were no homeless shelters, no social security.  It was a different world.Gruen does a great job of showing the read the America of the Depression years and also tells a wonderful story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "From the other reviews, i was expecting to have my socks knocked off as I had in \"The Glass Castle\" by Jeannette Walls and \"Replay\" by Ken Grimwood, but instead I found that I was pleasantly entertained. No more. No less. The most impressive parts of this book were Sara's portrayal of the elderly. I imagine that life for the elderly is pretty much as she portrays it, which I found enlightening and interesting. These parts ended up being my favorite! The rest of the book is colorful, imaginative, and worthwhile."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm usually drawn to books written about the depression era, as I have heard so much about it from my parents.  This book is not only that, but a great insight to the circus life during that time.  I had a hard time putting this book down in the evenings (after a day at work), and it was good timing that my spouse was out of town for the week.  Very well written, a great story, and a page turner. I'll be buying copies for future gifts."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Loved this book.  It portrays the life of survival of humans and animals alike.  It has always amazed me how elephants put up with us ignorant humans and our slow mentality in catching on as to how to treat them according to their abilities. The fact that elephants haven't done away with all evil handlers is a testament to the amazing personality, patience and attitude of their creation. The circus realm has a lot of shame, guilt and blame placed at its feet. Even though this is a fictional story, the real stories of circus elephants is much worse and a hard read.  I'm looking forward to another place in time where all will live in peace with all living things as this great earth was intended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "So far there are 866 reviews for this book, so there's nothing I can say that's different from anyone else.  It got to be so absorbing by the middle of the book with a VERY satisfying ending.  I couldn't resist adding another review to thank Sara Gruen for this wonderful story.  I just finished it a minute ago...I ignored my kids all night while caught up in this story.  Now my kids can have me back!  Please read and enjoy this book.  Thank you."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed reading about the history of the circus and the anecdotes shared by Sara Gruen.  It takes you back to an age of innocence in your life where the Circus was pretty close to the best thing that ever happened to you.  The elephants and the brave ladies that rode on them.  The clowns and the ittle people.  I enjoyed recreating those memories while reading this delightful and sweet account of two circus runaways who fall in love.  Their story was predictable in so many ways.  The old Jacob part was just sad and it left a sour feeling.  However, I did enjoy reading about the circus people and their lives.  The parades and the drama behind the curtain.  The roustabouts working so hard and sleeping in crowded spaces,yet what an adventure! to travel around the country from town to town brining smiles to millions and enjoying the camradie of the circus!  I loved that part."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished listening to this audio book and I have to say it was truly wonderful.  I felt the circus come alive, great imagery and historic detail.  You could picture the circus`s shows with great detail.  I listened to this while commuting and found myself really enjoying my drive to and  from  work, traffic and all. The only negative was the sex.  My tween daughter really wanted to read this book because of the movie trailer but I had to say no right away after just the first chapter or so.  It really didn't add that much to the story and wasn't needed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I didn't realize this book had been out for so long when I ordered it from Amazon.  Can't believe I hadn't heard of it before because it was a fantastic book I should have picked up sooner.  I think a movie is being made about the book, but I am glad I read the book first.  It's a quick read for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Definitely entertaining.  After I finished it, I felt like I was still transported back to the 1930's circus, and it took several hours to stop thinking about it.  Worth reading for sure."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My two best friends and I are all avid readers, although we usually read very different books. One of them got it, loved it and gave it to me, and this book was passed around for several months. We had a mother in law, an ex boyfriend all reading it, which really speaks to how good the book is.You can read the other reviews to find out what its about...I'm telling you, you will be hooked instantly. Clear your schedule. This isn't a book you want to start reading when its going to be a week before you can pick it up again."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is an awesome story about an engaging character that had me sneaking my kindle out at work to read a bit more.I loved it from start to finish. Some have criticized the amalgamation of the Jacob story from the Bible and post depression circuses but it works beautifully.The level of detail and insight into the train circus world shows an incredible amount of research but one of the most amazing things is none of those details come across as research. They are as natural to the story as the characters."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Not being, even remotely, a Robert Pattinson fan and not liking circuses either, I put off reading this book for several months after it was purchased.  I still couldn't help visualizing Robert Pattinson as the lead character, but eventually, the story took over and Robert faded a little.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really liked the book.  Well written, good story line and a bit of a surprise ending.  Still won't watch the movie (that Robert thing again) but the book is always better anyway."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Saw the movie before getting the book which I downloaded from Kindle.  Really liked the movie and then decided to buy the book.  The book is an easy read and if you ever have been to a circus or were curious about behind the scenes then you will probably enjoy the book. If you are looking for a deep mystery then this is probably not for you but if you like love stories and don't want to have to keep a notepad beside you to jot down things to remember so as not to get lost or confused in the story then this is the book for you.  I loved reading it on lazy days when I didn't have to concentrate real hard but could let my mind and imagination get lost in the characters and their telling of the story.  This Kindle book was downloaded immediately without any problems as usual."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "There were times I had to stop reading this book because it was so graphic.  I can't stand animal abuse of any kind, and I literally wanted to cry as the author described the treatment of the circus animals.  Some reviewers here have also been blasted for their criticism of the soft porn in this book, but it IS graphic and can be rather shocking.  I didn't expect this in the book at all and so as much as I wanted to like this book, I have my reservations about it.  Just be aware that there are some moments in Water for Elephants that are not for the squeamish or sensitive."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "'Water for Elephants' provides an insiders peek behind the curtain of a traveling train circus. Anyone who ever went to a circus and played the games on the midway are rubes wanting to be thrilled, enchanted and take leave of reality for a day. The illusion lasts about as long as cloud of cotton candy. The inside story delves into the darker aspects of what makes the circus viable especially during the 1930's Depression era. The reader is introduced to a strict caste system from bosses to performers to roustabouts that determines one's position among a long train of characters. The practice of 'redlighting' is  particularly powerful, a Darwinian, survival of the fittest practice where the circus bosses have the used up roustabouts tossed from the train as excess baggage. Our hero is Jacob Jankowski that over the course of  only 3 1/2 months joins the circus. As a veternarian he does not fit into the caste system. Through his character we take a journey making allies with unlikely people, finding love and slaying personal deamons."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book already has over 3,500 positive reviews on Amazon and every one of them is well deserved. This book was a wonderful treasure. I eargerly awaited each time in my day when my schedule allowed fiction reading so I could get back to this story. The characters are three dimensional, compelling, and as genuine as your next door neighbors or your long-lost aunts and uncles. The circus setting was fascinating, and the story-telling was first-rate, doesn't get much better than this. I highly recommend this book. I haven't seen the movie (yet), but if it's even half as good as the book it will be tremendous."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I knew very little about this book before I read it. I didn't know quite what to expect; but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It certainly wasn't as good as The Kite Runner or other great books I've read (thus why I didn't give it five stars), but it was still a very good story. I would easily recommend it to others. The author creates a rather fantastic situation - a Cornell veterinary student who suddenly finds himself a penniless orphan during the Great Depression. The story takes us to a circus train, a love triangle, and an elephant. Gruen weaves a wonderful tale that I found captivating, told both in the present and the past. In the meantime, I learned a great deal about circus life in the 1930s."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a great story line, but I really get disgusted with the writers that think they have a free license to use the Lord's name in vain. It has become a disgusting passtime and all too prevalent &#34;thing to do&#34;.  And why do they do it? It adds nothing to the story. Just a disgusted feeling and sorrorful feeling for the author. It shows how the people of the world are falling away from God. That is one thing I miss with my Kindle, I always use a black marker and mark out that word from the sentences or stop reading the book altogether."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "One day I was surfing Amazon looking for a good read. There are times when I'm looking for something different that I just go with a good title. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised, other times I'm not. This was a pleasant surprise. I'd never heard of the book or the author so I came in on a clean slate. It was a wonderful read, one of those books you hate to put down for mundane things such as work and sleep. I was instantly hooked on the main character, Jake, and the life he led. Sad in spots, dark and violent in some places, bittersweet at times, it was one of those stories that pulled me right in and made it hard to say goodbye when it was over."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For several years, various animal rights organizations have campaigned against circuses, citing the cruelty inflicted upon animals.  Gruen shows how cruelty permeated the institution.This is a wonderful novel about love and decadence, greed and control, and cruelty and tenderness.  It starts weakly, where the protagonist discovers his parents were killed in a freak traffic accident.  He hops a train, and winds up working for a circus.  But don't despair, I promise it's worth finishing.Gruen's characters are vividly drawn.  Hierarchies amongst performers, workers and management prevail.  Descriptions are so vivid, you can almost smell the hay, and everything else so accurately described.This is a wonderful window into life in a circus, with all it's horrors and despite them, it's draw.Well done!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As a prize-winning author myself, and a Pulitzer nominee, I know good writing.  This book was so riveting and fascinating I couldn't put it down.In fact, it became so real to me that I began to think of it as non-fiction some time after I'd finished.  I had to read these reviews to recollect it is fiction.  Having read a great many of the posted reviews, I can't help noticing the negative or low rated reviews are sneering and superior, and critical in the extreme.  This is, in my experience, typical of poor writers who feel compelled to comment scathingly on others' skills, but who are incapable of writing compelling literature themselves.  As a professional academic reviewer, I strongly disagree with the snide commentary.  It is a rare gem."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have seen this book on the shelves for sometime now and only just got around to reading it. It was so enjoyable that I read it in a day, I just couldn't put it down. The main character, Jacob, is intriguing without being over complicated. It is a peek into the history of the circus, all the while swirling a great mystery and love affair that will keep you glued to this page turner. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, mysteries, and a truly good read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was highly recommended to me by women in an assisted living facility where I teach, for whom one of the book themes--aging and loss of autonomy--resonated deeply. I found it an engaging read, though the story almost caves in under the weight of the author's research. The characters are archetypes I had the feeling I'd seen somewhere before, lacking complexity, and it was ultimately difficult to care about any of them. The shifts back and forth in time were distracting and superfluous. I felt manipulated by the fantastically sentimental ending, but still, it made me smile."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book does provide a fairly riveting story set within post depression America and also provides good insights into the circus business during this era. The book balances the dynamics of maintaining a circus in tough economic times against a host of vivid and disparate personalities that can both support and challenge the stability of the circus. For example there is Big Al who runs the circus with a nearly ruthless practicality, \"redlighting\" individuals who violate his rules. There is August, second in command, alternately tough and gracious, supportive and cruel. There is Jacob, the hero, who stumbles into the world after fleeing Cornell Vet School and who subsequently falls in love with August's wife. The book alternates between the young Jacob in the circus and the elderly Jacob in a nursing home. Some of the dialogue the characters use during the depression era sounds like it came from the 21st century but other than that there is a gritty, often grotesque and unblinking realism in everything from death to romance."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really enjoyed this book as I found it a very quick read with characters I was interested in.Water for elephants is told by an ornery man (Jacob Jankowki, about 90 years old), whose life now consists of residing in an assisted living center, where his children visit when they can.The story goes back and forth from his life in the present, to his life in the past, when by a turn of fate, he found himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Circus, as their Vet.  The time is the 1920-1930's  and we get to see life during The Great Depression.Their are many eccentric characters, and if you love the circus and animals, there is plenty of that for you.  I found the story of the circus performers lives fascinating.  It really is a great read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "In our hurried lives filled with responsibilities and all the stress associated with it, how many of us dream to run away with the circus?Well in Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, the central character Jacob Janjowski runs away from his life's troubles to join the Benzini Brothers train circus.In this new adventure Jacob comes of age with the circus freaks, clowns, and countless animals that dazzle the imagination of the many that come to peek into a world of wonder. He discovers love, hard work, and his passion for animals.Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen takes the reader on the lost world of the traveling circuits in an age that many lost hope because of the peril circumstances of the Great Depression.The first few pages simply grab you and you will not want to miss this page turner and the mystic circus world."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "90-ish Jacob Jankowski narrates his story in flashbacks from a nursing home. His days with the circus feel more real and alive to him than his current reality.After his parents are killed in a car accident, Jacob runs out on his vet school exams and joins the circus. Circus life is not always easy, but Jacob has experiences with humans and animals that change his life forever.Gruen brings the Depression-era circus vividly to life, along with its many colorful characters. If Rosie the elephant and Bobo the orangutan don't touch your heart, it's made of stone!Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants took a little while to fully grab my attention, with the flash backs between the circus and Jacob's time in the nursing home.  Once it got my attention it held it right through to the very end.There were a few relationships that stood out in my mind.  The first was between Rosemary and Jacob.  Their relationship exemplified the relationship I would hope all nursing home staff had with the residents.  Her understanding and patience as Jacob flashes back and forth between the present day and his youth is remarkable, and her connection seems to surpass the bond he shares with his children.I never would have thought I would enjoy a book that centered around the cicus, but this novel was about so much more than just the shows under the big top.  It focused on love, friendship, aging and compassion."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book because my sister-in-law (who never reads) could not put it down until she finished. So I gave it a go and, after a slow start, was interested enough to finish. The author does everything she can to exploit the reader's concern for cats, dogs, monkeys and, of course, the titular elephant. The narrator  is a vet who sticks with the circus, at first, in order to protect the animals, but he does little to interfere with their mistreatment... or the mistreatment of his fellow humans. In that sense, the book rings false. The book exploits the reader's feeling for animals and animal-human relationships for some cheap emotional effect. And it worked on me to some extent because I  cared about (and shed shed tears for) the animals much more than the humans. But I fail to see larger point."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I agree with several other people who found it amazing that this is a bestseller. As an author whose books sell poorly right here on Amazon, I wish I knew her secret. I found it disgusting on so many levels, hard to follow, and in the end, just not worth reading. Perhaps something in the last third of the book would have changed my mind, but I couldn't finish it. I can't remember the last time I threw a book into the garbage can, but I looked it over carefully, thought about the very act of throwing out a book, and then dropped it into the trash. I don't regret it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A sad story, beautifully told. Gruen cuts effortlessly between a faultless evocation of a seedy circus during the Depression - a grotesquerie if ever there was one -  and the modern-day life of an nonagenarian trapped in a failing body and a souless nursing home. Gruen's vivid prose and dead-on dialog transport the reader to a place and time, both physical and emotional, that does not fail to fascinate.  What in less talented hands might easily be a depressing tale of old age is animated by the spunk and wit of her main character.  My only complaint about the story is its ending, which I frankly found implausible.  But that's a minor complaint about an otherwise absorbing book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What an intriguing story!  From the first gripping lines of the prologue, I was pulled into the world of the traveling circus, a world I had purposefully avoided until now.  Told through the perspective of an elderly man's recollections, this book is full of grit, empathy, and adventure, and is a sharp portrayal of the seedier side of the depression era sideshow life.  The author juxtaposed greed, sloth, abuse, mental illness, and the fascinating circus world of cheap glamour and talented charlatans against the bittersweet remembrances of an old man and his present day frustration with trying to live life more fully at an advanced age.  There is a little surprise at the end that I had not foreseen.  The back of the book describes this work with words like vivid, rich, and riveting.  It is all of those things and more - a great story well told.  Water for elephants is highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A remarkably fast read,leaving the reader breathless from tight action and tingling suspense.  This book reveals the glitz and sparkle of the circus, along with its dark and terrible underside that lurks barely out of sight.  The two time frames - of old Jacob and young Jacob - are carried through smoothly by Gruen, who ties the events together  with skillful repetition of words and phrases.  I wish there were more novels that take place during the Depression - an era that had such enormous impact on our society and continues to reverberate in modern times.  This book did not make me want to run away and join a circus.  It did make me happy that movements toward animal-less circuses have made a toehold."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had some idea of the content of this book before I started reading, but was extremely impressed with the author's skill in opening the world of the Depression-Era circus, and the fascinating people who populated it.  Her ability to shift between the poignant situation of the aged Jacob, and the youthful enthusiasm and passion of the youthful Jacob made this novel 'work' better than most I've read in years.  The ending did catch me by surprise, and was absolutely delightful in all respects.  I will commend this book to the attention of anyone who wants to look through a window on the past, and the believable people who occupied that world -- told in the words of a very gifted author."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I can't believe it took me this long to pick this book up.  What a great story and very well written.  I always enjoy books that go back and forth between past & present, and the author did it brilliantly.The only thing I disliked was reading about the treatment of the animals, but that is to be expected with a circus story.Would definitely recommend this book to a friend.  I'm sure the upcoming move won't do the book justice, but will at the very least draw some new readers."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I get the creeps when I think of circuses from the mid 1900's. That was one of the reasons I put off reading this book even though I bought it quite some time ago. Eventually I just had no more unread books left and too long for my paycheck to arrive. I picked it up and barely put it down. I really got me hooked from the start and despite my despise of circuses I really liked it. I do think Gruen could have made Marlena more alive in the story. To me, she was just a beautiful girl. Her character never seemed to gain any life. But I especially cared for Jacob and the looking back of the old Jacob. It got me thinking of life, nursery homes and love.  You might even say it moved me. It didn't cure me though - circuses still gives me the creeps!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I picked this book up by chance at the bookstore. I was interested at once in the subject and the characters. I know nothing about the circus and was captivated by the descriptions of depression era circuses. This was all new territory for me and to find out in the notes at the end that all this information was based on fact was exciting.I loved having each chapter start with a picture from the Ringling Brothers circus archives. I wasso happy at the ending, I truly did not see it coming. Such a feel good story. I have recommended it to many of my friends, including my book club. Try it, you will like it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a great book!  I picked it up at my library after hearing it suggested at my book club.  I didn't want the story to end, but I wanted it to end because it was just so powerful and moving.  By the end I was crying from shock, grief, and sheer happiness.  The author took a subject that I've never thought about and gave it so much life.  I want to know more about circus trains and old time circus shows.  Read it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A very unusual book. I couldn't put it down. It gives an insight to circus life in the days when they travelled by train. It is written through the eyes of a young lad who traumatised by the death of his parents was unable to complete his final exam to become a vet and accidentally joins the circus. The characters and the animals are all very real. Some you love and some you hate (never the animals. Anyone who loves circuses and remembers (or would like to know) how they used to be will love this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story is lovely and you cannot put it down. I read every word from cover to cover. There are also authors notes, an interview with Sara Gruen, and questions for book group discussions.Now back to my title for review. So many of you gave the story away you should not rethink your reviews. Thank G-d, I had already chose to read this book when I read Riding Lessons. I had never read one review on this book before I bought it. I wonder what goody Sara has for us next. It will be fun as long as I stay away from reviews!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm not sure what to say about this book.  I enjoyed it - it's a cute little historical fiction - but it wasn't fantastic.  just a few random thoughts on the book:* The most interesting character was Walter the dwarf clown and he had a very limited role.* Jacob, the narrator I liked more as a 93yo than as a 23yo, and I never really felt the connection between him and Marlena.* The grime of the circus itself was part of what kept me sucked in - that was brilliantly described.* In the end, I felt a great deal of sympathy for August - he wasn't a good man by any means, but he also was fighting some serious demons.Like I said, I liked the book but I don't feel I need to run out and watch the movie now ...."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "i enjoyed reading this book. Although it will not go down in the ranks of a great American Classic, it is still agood read. There was a feeling for the desperation of the period, and the atypical lives of the circus. Some of the characterizations were a bit shallow and somewhat predictable, the plot manages to keep the reader engaged. I enjoyed the contrasting chapters of the young protagonist and his later, elderly self. The ending is sweet, but quite unplausible. All of these things considered, I still gave this book an overall 4 rating."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "On the simplest level, all I can say is that it didn't amuse me and I couldn't force myself to finish it. But I'm a \"hard sell\" for fiction, and I can see by the other reviews that many people loved it. Lucky them!On a slightly more analytic level, I'd say that what prevented me from enjoying the book was the \"voice\" of the narrator, who is supposed to be a man in his nineties remembering his youth in the circus. I'm a man approaching seventy, with some circus experiences as a teenager in Iowa and as the father of a circus acrobat in the Cirque de Soleil era. I found the \"voice\" of the narrator unconvincing, extremely unconvincing, as a male of the species and as a male American of the 1930s and 1940s. I couldn't get past that central implausibility. I found myself scoffing at the sensibilities of the pseudo-male narrator at every emotional turn of this quite melodramatic novel."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As most previous reviewers have said, this is a rich tale of circus life in the '30's. The protaganist, Jacob, is appealing with personality and real human emotion. I feel the author Ms. Gruen has well-researched everything-circus in writing this book.I felt while reading this book I was actually seeing what transpired in my mind's eye-I could see the rough characters come alive and could smell the sawdust, cookin grease, animals and popcorn. I felt what the characters felt when they fell upon hard times. This book also opened my eyes regarding how a rough slice of life a small circus can be.Bring on the circus parade!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is about an old man at the end of his days reflecting upon his life and the events that lead him to run away and join the circus right before he finishes college.  His story goes back and forth between his modern day stay at a nursing home and his days in his early 20s during the Great Depression traveling around the country with the Great Benzini Brothers Circus.Sara Gruen does a phenomenal job of painting a vivid portrait of Depression era America and of the end of the golden age of circus life in the USA.  The Photos that head each chapter are fun little bonuses that let you see the actual performers of this time as well as some of the settings in which the book takes place.The characters come to life and are vivid portrayals of heroes and villians.  The relationships formed amongst all the characters are memorable and keep you wanting more.  A page turner that does a good job of keeping you interested by flipping back and forth between past and present.5 star recommendation."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I am not a big fan of books on tape.  My husband is...on long trips we listen. If you dont mind listening to an old man with wet phlegm in his throat for hours ...go for it.  Since I picked this tape based on the reviews from Amazon I suffered through 5 dvd's so far. The story is not interesting or enlightening. A bad story can be read thru rather quickly but on tape listening at a horribly slow pace....well  ...it is like water torture."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is an engaging, fast paced story of a veterinarian in a circus during Prohibition.  The plot tension is well-handled and intense.  There is plenty of likeable characters, as well as villains.  And, of course, animals.  It is well-researched, and the setting (circus train stopping in many towns) is realistic, as are the many details of circus life.  I'd thought of circus culture as highly cohesive, but this novel showed serious social stratification.  The characterization is about that of the best genre fiction, though the book isn't genre.  The ending is a bit of a stretch, but a positive one.  The book was hard to put down.  An excellent read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was so well researched, that you are transported effortlessly  back in time with Jacob .  Upon learning that most of the incidents in the book are true, just makes this already incredible book all the more awe inspiring. It is impossible not to get caught up in Jacob's life with the circus.  The characters he encounters during his circus days are so real sometimes you think you can actually smell them, but it's his relationship with the animals, especially Rosie the elephant, that particularly touch your heart.  You won't easily forget Rosie and you'll be glad when Jacob can't either.  There is nothing more satisfying than when you finish a book and you feel like you also were part of the adventure.  I am so glad I was packed and ready."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was apprehensive about reading this book since I watched the movie first. I didn't want to compare and then end up with mixed feelings. I'm so happy that I did watch the movie first because I feel I had a better view of the books layout. The story kept me on the edge of my seat even though I had expectations for the events outcomes. I love that the story of Jacob was related to the bible and I commend the author for that. Amazing book. I love the feeling after reading an outstanding  book and this is surely one of them. Excellent job."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "There is a reason this book is so popular. Not only is a swift-moving adventure, a historical fiction, but it's a a love story about life. And, Sarah Gruen is extremely adept at vividly describing the interior life -- not only of the circus and circus life she so carefully researched but also the interior, psychological experience of her characters, including Jacob, the lead character -- even as an old man. She enters into his experience so deeply that it is impossible as a reader, not to as well! You see the nursing home, the circus, the animals, the rough competition, and the connection.Sarah Gruen has created a book which transcends the circus, and highlights the importance of life and living, no matter how old we are.This is indeed summer reading, and one of the best books I've read all year."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love this novel. I started reading a printed version, but I had a hard time distinguishing character voices as it was not always marked. And then there were alternating \"young\" and then \"old\" point of view chapters. Before giving up (because I have the same type of challenge when I read Amy Tan novels), I switched to the audio \"book on tape\" and LOVED the book. One of the best novels I've read. And the voice-over talent who read the audio version is a very, very good storyteller."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "There is a reason that this book has so many 5 star reviews...I avoided reading this for a while because I didn't think that I'd be interested in novel set in a circus during the depression, but I finally picked it up after yet another person told me how good it was.  I'm so glad that I did!  It really is the best thing that I've read in a long time.  I quickly became engrossed and could not put it down.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try, you will not be disappointed. Oh, and I LOVED the ending!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants draws you in from the very beginning. The story is fast paced and details circus life during the Depression years, making the reader see that for many, the circus was a way to keep food in one's stomach, when others had no jobs and were going hungry.Gruen does a good job of detailing the factual side of operating and working a circus, while keeping the story engaging. The only minor problem is that characterization is a bit weak, especially regarding Jacob, the main character.The book contains photos from circus archives, which is a nice touch."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I can't say it was bad but it sure wasn't good. I have had the book for many years and just got around to reading it. Major disappointment considering the hype and accolades. It had the potential to be much better, but it was trite and lagged all the way through, for the most part. I'm mystified by the massive attention. It, in my opinion, is mediocre, at best. 3 stars is the max I can give it. Great literature it's not. Sophomoric comes to mind."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water For Elephants is an excellent novel depicting railroad circus life during the early part of the 20th century.  The author, Sara Gauen researched boxcar circuses before writing Water, the societal environment of the depression, attitudes toward circus workers by owners, treatment of the animals in the menageries and how they were obtained during the depression era then rapped everything into the lives of her main characters, add to this the breaking of the sexual mores frowned on by society, mix, and you have a recipe that makes for good reading.  The best thing about Water is the telling of the story by Jacob Jankowski, who is a 90 or 93 year old Vet depending on how you look at it, now confined in a residential nursing home and looking back into his past. Heads up folks Water for Elephants is coming out as a movie soon and I am looking forward to seeing it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen spins a fascinating tale of murder, love, obsession, and life in Water for Elephants.  The characters were interesting and well developed.  Her portrayal of the elderly was spot-on without being stereotypical.  That's a very difficult thing to do; not many authors are capable of unraveling the story of an elderly character.Her portrayal of circus life is intriguing, and the characters never failed to invoke strong feelings of endearment, horror, amusement, or pity.  I wouldn't call this a \"must read,\" but it is definitely an interesting story that was well written and well researched."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had heard this was a good book.  I was misinformed.  This was the most crude, foul book I have ever attempted to read.  Though the main story was mildly interesting, the all too frequent use of profanity and descriptions of intimate relations put me off entirely.  I started trying to use white out to cover the offensive items.  I quickly realized that would include a great deal of the book.  I decided I didn't want to fill my mind with such things and stopped reading.  This book went directly into the recycle bin rather than being donated to a thrift store.  I didn't want another unwitting person to go through the same experience I did."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was slow to start but once I got into it I could not put it down.  It twisted and turned all over the place.  It was such a relief despite some of the more depressing points that it had a great happy ending.  The author did a great job giving Rosie the elephant human characteristics.  I liked that it was told from the point of view of an older man looking back.  Even his ending to the story was an amazing one.  I would definantly recommend this book to a friend."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It's also the only circus novel I've ever read. This is an entertaining drama novel with a love triangle. The characters are nicely fleshed out, and there is a nice to and fro between Jacob's current life as a ninety year old and his adventures in the circus. Gruen does a charming job of describing Jacob as an old man and the ending is very good. Whilst the book is good I think it has been lucky that it has benefitted from great marketing and a big budget film as there are other books which are more powerful & more deserving than this book that have not received any recognition.Enjoyably recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a wonderful book made better by excellent readers.Jacob Jankowski joins the circus as a young man after the death of his parents.  This was during the depression when many were willing to work for little more than regular meals.  Sara Gruen tells the story of a traveling circus with a surety that makes it hard to believe she has never experienced the cruelty, hard times and camaraderie of circus life.  Even more amazing, the story is told from the perspective of Jacob as a 93 year old man forgotten in a nursing home.There are two readers, one for the young Jacob and one for the old, and both are a true pleasure to listen to."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Yes it has its dark moments.  And yes it can be disturbing.  And that means the author did the job right.The book follows the life that was not an easy one and is not the perfect sunset of old age and conveys it all in the context of a world that most people do not know the in and outs about, the circus, but at the same time which is something we all have dreamed about.  If not dreamed about, at least were enamored with when we were young.As others said, I could not put this book down and lost a bit of sleep turning a few extra pages further in the evening.  But it was worth it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a beautifully constructed book. The circus atmosphere is rich and detailed, and it's redolent of its time period. The images are strong and the pace, while not fast, is stately -- perhaps the way an elephant moves??I deducted a star for two reasons. First, it seemed that some leaps in the story came too quickly. Jacob should have spent a bit more time with Rosie before he made the statement \"I was close to falling in love with her;\" that happened a bit too fast to be believable. Also, the ENDING was awful: contrived and saccharine. That was a huge disappointment, after the rest of the book.Overall, though, a literary and very good read, two things that don't always go together."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was really eager to read this book after seeing all the great reviews for it.  However,  I started reading it and could not get into it.  The whole first half dragged for me, with not too much going on in the story. The writing was difficult to read at times, and I agree with some of the reviewers here, it often read as a screenplay which made it that much harder to get into.  But about halfway through the book, the plot starts moving and I actually end up finishing the book and I'm glad I did.  I'm still not sure why the book itself is getting rave reviews, but I am looking forward to seeing how the movie version of the book will turn out."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When I read a book, I want to immerse myself in it.  I don't want jarring inconsistencies to remind me that it's fiction, and not particularly well written fiction at that.  The speech of Jacob, who supposedly is in the setting of 70 years ago, is disturbingly nonauthentic.  People at that time didn't use the same phrases we use now and putting them in, when you're picturing them in the dress and background of that time period is annoying and unnecessary.  This author needed a better editor.  It's not a 'best' book and the fact that the author is begging for votes makes you wonder about her integrity."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had high expectations for this, but it was kind of a chore to finish.  It was too depressing!  Too much brutality to the circus animals AND the circus humans, drunkenness, filth, squalor -- plus the portrait of life in the nursing home was grim.  When the narrator finally gets his true love, the author rushes through it in a few sentences and then goes back to the grimness.  I give her two stars because she's obviously done a lot of research on circuses, and I thought the photos were charming."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was recommended to me by a few different people.  I knew NOTHING about it when I went to pick it up.  I was hesitant at first.  I am not a fan of the circus at all.  But knowing that one of the friends that had recommended it is also not a fan of the circus, I was cautiously optimistic.I am glad that I gave it a chance.  It is a well written story that really draws a vivid picture for you.  A great reflection of the times with a love story that had me in tears in parts.  Highly recommend to all."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I thought this book was wonderful!  I loved the way the author juxtaposes the young Jacob with the older Jacob; such a method has the potential to be jerky or awkward, but the transitions are smooth and the reader can easily manage to keep up with both storylines.Gruen is a skilled storyteller, I was caught from the first page and couldn't put the book down.  I love when a book does that, and makes me both happy and sad, and this book does both of these things at various points.  The most emotional aspect of the book for me was how Jacob felt about being in a nursing home, his frustration at having a \"young\" mind in an older body, and being treated as though he's senile by the nursing home staff as well as his own family.  This happens a lot in our culture, we tend to pack away the old because we don't want to be reminded of what we will be one day.  Wonderful, wonderful.  5 stars."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants takes you to the time of the Great Depression on a circus train.  I was hesitating on reading this story because I thought it would be heartbreaking.  It's hard for me to read about animal cruelty and reading about a circus there is bound to be some ugly scenes.  There are some scenes that were hard to read, but for the most part I felt the author did spare us the raw details.  Sara Gruen knows how to write rich details in such a way that the circus jumped off the pages.  I felt like I was there surround by the sounds and smells of the circus.  I loved the characters and Rosie the elephant was the show stopper.  It was a pleasure reading this story and a huge plus for me that it had a happy ending."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Loved it! This was a really complete story. The characters were fascinating, the setting exotic and the story enthralling from the beginning. The writing didn't get in the way of the story (which I love). I loved the animal characters and their relations with the humans. It had a \"Life of Pi\" vibe, but was more grounded in reality. I got very attached to the main character as an old man (it jumps back and forth - but not in an annoying way - really lends itself to telling the epic of his life while only delving into a few years of it). The author shows restraint describing any suffering of animals and lowly circus workers - which I appreciate - can't stand when they knock you over the head with it. Very well researched, no boring details - just the good stuff :)"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants captivates the reader with its deeply moving and touching storyline.It is charming,magical.... laced with sadness,humour,joy. The story of a young man who loses everything dear to him in this world and then finds meaning and happiness in the most unexpected and least likely place....a traveling circus. The book really brings to life the spirit and times of a traveling circus(set in the backdrop of the Great Depression). Its many colorful,unique characters vividly bring to life this largly forgotten bygone era.Water for Elephants is simply a pleasure to read.  The only drawback to the book is that there is quite a bit of cursing and several sexually explicit passages that might offend certain readers.If you can overlook or skip these rough spots you will certainly experience great pleasure in reading Water for Elephants."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. I'll probably only give a handful of five-star reviews. This and Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet are my favorite books from what I've read this past year, and I've done a lot of reading.  The story just sucked me in.  Usually when a book goes back and forth between past and present there is one time period I prefer over another.  I will trudge through the less preferred period of time just to get to the better part.  In this book, I enjoyed both past and present equally. It's just well done."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a beautiful story Sara has woven with \"Water for Elephants\".  It really made me reflect on how difficult it must be for elderly people to have lost most of their friends and loved ones and how them can only relive the memories of their lives.  This book was captivating--love, adventure,friendship, excitement, betrayal, and the special love between animals and humans--all rolled into one wonderful tale.  From the time I started reading it-it was all I could do to put it down--kept me awake reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore.I will definitely be keeping watch for any new books written by Sara Guren--she is a fantastic story teller."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The parts of this book that dealt with the main character in old age, were very insightful and I enjoyed that.  But quite honestly had I known that it would detail the abuse of the circus animals and then also the detailed sex acts I would never had purchased this.  I wish I knew how to delete it from my Kindle.  I also wish someone else had mention this in the reviews that I saw.  I NEVER stop reading a book, but had to quit about 35% of the way thru it, it was disgusting and I am not a prude.I would never recommend this book, nor will I venture to the movie."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I found this book to be between 3 and 4 stars, but closer to a four. The first sentence had a grammatical error, and the descriptions were too involved and wordy, so I was afraid I would be disappointed. I wasn't. It turned out to be a well-written book. Gruen actually took me to the circus world in the early thirties, and I lived it along with Jacob. Not only that, but seeing Jacob in his nineties, gives the reader a new appreciation for the elderly. Although I could have done without the cursing and gritty sex scenes, I still found the book interesting, at times delightful, and well worth the read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Spolier Alert (kinda): I really enjoyed the reflection of the characters past and present. I found the love story to be a bit wishy washy.  when visting the main characters past I didn't really buy into the &#34;love at first sight&#34; idea. Not sure why, but I was asking why? Why did Marlena fall in love with Jacob? What made him stand out so much? It sounds bad that i say that, but I just didn't feel a spark between the characters. The whole damsel in distress was manufactured. Additionally, it was super convenient the way they ended up together in the end. Overall, I did enjoy the story and I was more drawn to the present version Jacob."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants was one of those books that was difficult to put down.  The prose flowed very smoothly. The subject of the circus world during the depression was well researched and make accessible to the reader.  It could be read on many levels, but even a surface level was satisfying.My only problem, as with many best sellers, was that the action was in places not very realistic.  This may be a bit picky, but after suffering from a concussion, nobody is ready to climb on top of a moving train and hop between cars, no matter how pumped they are with adrenaline.  Such lapses in credibility hurt an otherwise wonderful novel."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I found this book fairly well crafted, but did not believe in the characters or the story, which seemed awfully thin and contrived. The author admits in a postscript that she borrowed extensively from old newspaper stories and made up composite characters based on real-life people and animals, which is close to plagiarism if you ask me. The main character, Jacob, who is 93, and tell the story in flashbacks, is much too lucid for his age to be credible, and Marlena, the woman he eventually steals, comes across as flat and uninteresting.Like other reviewers, I found the dialogue artificial and at times anachronistic. Haven't seen the movie but not much source material to work with."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I could write a book about this book but will keep it short and simple.  This book tells a very entertaining story of Jacob (never referred to as \"Jake\" in the book) and a twist of fate that sees his fate aligned with a circus after his parents are killed.  It's a very engaging book, well written and enough to keep you reading into the wee hours of the night.  I can't imagine the movie could possibly keep up but may give it a shot.  I don't see Robert Pattison as Jacob necessarily.Great book!  And for those who seemed to think the book fell flat - you're digging too deep for meaning - relax and enjoy a good read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The strength of the book is its narrative flow. I particularly liked the little catch-words that usually connected the \"assisted living\" chapters with the circus chapters. Gruen generally wrote in such connections, and I found them both ingeniously crafted and useful in uniting the narrative.In addition to telling a great story, Gruen gives a remarkably detailed picture of the circus world of the 1930s. I had definitely never heard of a \"cooch tent\" before reading this book, for example, and Gruen's depiction of its solo practitioner is thoughtful, humane, and free of cliches. The ideas of circuses getting booted out of town, of people getting booted off the circus trains, and of entrepreneurs cannibalizing the remnants of failed circuses were also quite fascinating.To the extent that Gruen wanted to make an analogy to the biblical Jacob story by obscurely dropped hints and anagrammed names, I think, however, that she pushed too far. This novel stands nicely on its own without this type of symbolism or metaphor."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Beautifully written with characters that define humanity with their strengths but more so their weaknesses, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a most touching tale that brings the reader into a completely different and lost world of the travelling circuses during the Great Depression.What makes Sara Gruen's novel all too unique is her ability to bring us into the lives of her ordinary characters leading such extraordinary existence in the circus world.  Amidst the spectacle to provide temporary entertainment lies the cruelty and the debauchery never seen outside the performance area. A grumpy dwarf and his pet, an elephant who exhibits exceptional talent and is more human than the people around her ... a circus star and a would-be vet ... who would have thought that an insight into their lives can so summarize the abandonment of youth ...and the sadness of old age reviewing an existence that has come to pass?One of the most worthwhile reads for quite a time, this novel is a gem."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book! I couldn't put it down! It was a bit \"fluffier\" reading than I originally thought it would be, but it was fabulous none-the-less. The descriptions are vivid, not cliched; the characters are interesting; and the weaving of present-day Jacob with the Jacob of a bygone era is delightful.I would call this a must read... not because it will change your life or make you think about the world around you, but because it is just so enjoyable. I gave it a 4.5 because it isn't a book that will make you think long after the last page is read, but it will make you sad you've left the colorful circus world of Jacob Jankowski."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a good book about the circus (a comment I never thought I would ever make).  Jacob's story is heartbreakingly sympathetic.  Ms. Gruen's mastery of the circus vocabulary really sets the stage for the plotline.  A remarkable amount of reseach went into writing circus lore.  This is no Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth.  This is a downtrodden, edging ever closer to disaster circus run by the same type of people.  I must admit I had to skip anything that resembled animal cruelty (although I am sure it is factual).  My inability to deal with this led to my giving the book only 4 stars.  A reflection on the reviewer more than on the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a delightful summer read. Everything about this book was good. You could really identify and feel passionate (good or bad) about the characters, including the animals. All the loose ends are wrapped up. It makes me feel nostalgic and she has a way of transporting you back in time without being too wordy. The book is well written and entertaining. This was pretty  much the best book I read all summer. I even cried a little at the end. :) I really hope they make this book into a movie. It would be such a great movie if it was done correctley. Everyone should read this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have to admit I did not finish it. It was simultaneously boring, cliched, badly written and trite. Oh and repetitive. The only redeeming feature of the book was the parts where Jacob was an old man. If the author could write like that more consistently then she would be on to something. I cannot figure out why people love this book so much. If you compare it to another recently very popular book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, at least that book was riveting, even though it was also not very well written. I am not looking for Faulkner, but if a book is not high literature it should at least have a compelling plot. This book had neither neither good writing style nor an interesting plot. Don't waste your time."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It honestly took me weeks to finally talk myself into buying this book, I just said screw it and did it. I started reading it and could not put it down. By far my favorite book. (this month anyhow) I love to read the books before I see the movie and even though 9 out of 10 times I am very disapointed with the movie I honestly can not wait to see this movie! I think that the book was so real and made me feel like part of the circus so much that watching the movie will make me feel even more so part of the circus. I passed this book along to a \"reading buddy\" of mine and told her just read it! She text me the next day and said she had just finished it and it was SOOOOOO GOOD (This girl in not one to read a book in a day) If you are reading these reviews trying to descide weather to buy this or not by suggestion is.... Just buy it! Well worth the money!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I dont need to go into too much detail, as most of the reviews here have covered the plot.  I downloaded this on my kindle app during a horrendous layover at the airport, and it was nice read that kept my interest.  For some reason this book reminds me of Mitch Albom, in the style it was written and the flashbacks.  Looking forward to the movie, as I had envisioned the main character Marlena to look very similar to Reese Witherspoon during my read.  Pictures kept the chapters interesting as well."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book. It's about an lonely old man in a nursing home who's memories are sparked with the circus comes to town. He remembers back to his youth when he left veterinary school because of his parent's tragic deaths and joined the traveling circus. He details his unique experiences in the traveling show and of all the colorful people he became friends and enemies with. As mentioned in the title, there is an elephant, but the story is really about a young man's experiences as he struggles and learns his place in the hierarchy of circus and in life. Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'd probably never have picked up this book on my own, but it was chosen by a book club I've been coerced into joining.  It was an enjoyable book and very quick to read.  It's the story of a young man who accidently joins a mangy circus during the depression following a personal tragedy, and grows up in the process.  The background of the circus, particularly at this time in recent history, was vivid and fascinating, and it would be worth reading the book for that alone."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is about a young man lost a down time of now family, no work but finds a Circus and gets on by watering the elephants, Not fitting in but still clinging on.  Fell in love with someone he could not have, finally wins the love, but looses frightening friendship with the crazy Ringmaster, and manager of the Circus.  We go through the hard times of the circus money not knowing what comes next and everyone is Leary of everyone.  At the End he learns he had a great life even as strange as it was. It was a good story about the hard time in that timeline and period."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Although this is a work of fiction, author Sara Gruen did extensive research into the circus world during the Depression years.  She weaves some real-life incidents into the story of Jacob Jankowski, a beloved only son who is well on his way to becoming a veterinarian.  Shortly before he is due to graduate, his parents are killed in a car accident and he is left penniless.  He accidentally climbs on a circus train and his fate is then sealed.  Despite the fact that he has not finished his veterinary training, he is taken on as a circus vet.  The story is told by Jacob when he is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and is waiting for his family to come and take him to the cicus.  The book is interesting and creative, and is a very good read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I am not quite sure how to rate this book.  It was a book club pick or I probably would not have read it.  I picked it up and put it down countless times before I could actually finish it.  I just could not get past the animal cruelty scenes.  Plus I am probably one of a minority of people that do not believe animals are here for our entertainment.  The fact that they were and still are, I am sure, in many third rate circuses/traveling zoos mistreated makes it all the more heartbreaking for me.  I had to give the book stars for the scenes involving Jacob in his old age and also for making you care about the characters.  I cried over Walter's fate.  The author also took pity on me and at least made me think some of the animals received a better fate and future.  I keeping thinking about Rex though..........."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was practically forced to read this book by my partner, who loved it and would not stop insisting that I had to read it. I offered lots of excuses as I put it off, but the truth is, I couldn't care less about the circus. When I finally gave in and started reading Water for Elephants, I realized on the first page that my apathy for the circus didn't matter.This was a touching, clever, totally unexpected story. It offers a window into how we treat the elderly, animals, and people of a different class, without ever being preachy. There were times when I feared it would become a depressing wallow, but that never happened. The unexpected upswing at the end was particularly satisfying. A great read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a fun story, cleverly delivered as Jacob moves back in time to relive his story and returns to the present, his disgruntled present.  Some critics have complained about the ending, but I'd have to say they are Bah, humbug critics.  The ending is delightful, one of the best ever. This is a feel good story and it IS fiction, so the complainers, IMO, just don't understand Suspended disbelief.  The story is magical in its authentic setting and making you feel you are under the big top. It is sometimes shocking, sometimes painful, always compelling. Don't miss this one.  ...Karleene Morrow, author of Destinies, a novel."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "While certainly Water for Elephants includes the harsh reality of what circus life was like during the depression, I found it more of a story of hope, love and survival. How desperation drives people to do tragic things to one another, yet just when you think all is lost, a surprising hero can save the day.As with any good story, the author must offer conflict and contrast, and as much as animal cruelty existed in the story, so did an intense love for animals that some of the characters had. In many ways this story was one of good vs. evil set in the unusual backdrop of the circus train.This is one of my new favorites.  I read it twice, about a year apart and I enjoyed it as much the second time."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I don't think this story could have been any better than it was. I read it front to back in one sitting. I just couldn't put it down! I don't read reviews before I read a book, I'll read anything I can get my hands on. When I got this book I flipped through it, and I didn't think I'd like it because of the pictures. But after the FIRST page I was hooked. I LOVED LOVED LOVED Jacob and Marlana...and HATED Uncle Al and August. I wanted to cry everytime Auggie went to the tent to lay it on Rosie. It made me sick. It's been a while since I read something so moving! A+++++++++"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book last year and am sincerely hoping that the movie is able to sufficiently capture the adventure, romance, and poignancy.  I not only enjoyed the flashbacks to the days in the circus - I REALLY enjoyed the perspective of the character in a current day nursing home.  This book has it all and is written in a way that it easily became a movie in my mind as I read.  Many times books like this have sad endings but the ending to this story is excellent!  I highly recommend this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was curious.  I knew there was a movie based on the book.  I had never seen that movie as I thought it looked cheesy.  So I took a chance on the book and was not disappointed!What a view into the circus culture!  Things the customers don't see and would never expect!  I've been dying to see the movie since and can't find it in Redbox and none of my friends own it.  And it's not On Demand!  I will see it at some point though.  I think now it will be worth it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've decided I just can't finish this book. The main character is a 23-year old male, but c'mon - I just don't appreciate some of the details the author is having him describe and they are totally unnecessary to the story. I've read almost nine chapters and decided I don't need any more images like the explicit strip scene, the details of a graphic \"8-pager\", and I certainly didn't need the picture of what the dwarf is doing alone on his cot while looking at the graphic magazine. It's a big disappointment because the story is actually interesting and I want to find out what happens but not badly enough to wade through the sludge. I don't think I've been this disappointed in a story since the ending of Angela's Ashes."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book from cover to cover, and I'm glad I did.  But I thought it was very sad, because of the old man in the nursing home narrating the book, because of the animal abuse to the elephant and other species, and because of the spousal abuse to the elephant rider.  Oh, there were elements of humor, friendship, love, and happiness.  The ending was good as well as unexpected.  Still, if I had to describe this book in just one word, it would be \"sad.\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen's gorgeous new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, unfolds as a dual narrative, alternating between Jacob Jankowski's life as a nonagenarian, and his time spent working for a ragtag Depression-era circus as a young man. The plot is captivating (I missed two meals because I didn't want to put the book down) and Gruen's writing, as always, is transcendent. She deftly evokes a fascinating period in American history that deserves to be revisited, and her characters--human and animal alike--will stay with you long after you turn the last page."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water For Elephants was just what I wanted in a book right now: an easy read, fun, romantic, with a unique setting. Sara Gruen's research into the life of long forgotten train circuses and America in the 1930s was obviously extensive and the way she used her knowledge in the writing of the book was loving and playful and made me want to learn more about it. There were a few things that I looked up, curious to know if they were the author's invention or actual historical facts that she incorporated into her story. For example, I had never heard of \"Jake Leg\" before and commend her for revealing in the context of her book parts of American history that most people must be unfamiliar with. The characters were well drawn and the fictional Circus she created was completely believable. I loved the photographs that accompanied each chapter which added to the believablity of her story. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to immerse themselves in a good old fashioned yarn filled with romance and even a little danger."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book because I wanted to see the movie.  I opened it and the first few pages compelled me to download it immediately.  I have been reading it through the new year and hate putting it down!  AWESOME book, it has everything you'd think went &#34;behind the scenes&#34; in the 30s in a circus...  :)Plus the Jacob J character at 90 or 25 is an amazing write... being a writer, I can say that the character had me at the visual in the first few pages!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I actually wanted to give this book a 4.5 because it was more than your average \"I like it\" 4, but not quite the brain-exploding-spectacular 5. It was close, though. When I started reading, I wasn't sure if I'd like it; the story started slowly and felt disjointed at times. By the time I was about half-way through, however, I was flying through the pages, sneaking off to read every moment I could spare. I even read in the middle of the work day! Crazy. But it was that good. The circus culture of the early 1900s always intrigues me, particularly where it relates to animals. Gruen treated the topic with affection and accuracy, both of which she deftly imparts to the reader. I love Rosie the Elephant. A word to the wise: this novel was fairly gritty both for violence and sex, so not for YA readers."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book.  I could not put it down, because I was in such suspense about what would happen next.  I particularly love the storyline of the character as an old man in a nursing home - having worked in nursing homes, the descriptions are spot on.  I laughed out loud at his antics, and cried when characters I had grown to love were lost to tragedy.  I have never read a book where an elephant is a main character and pivotal to the story.  All I can say is \"WOW.\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm not one to read historical pieces, mostly because I don't think I'll relate to the people and times, but this book is an exception. An exceptional exception! I loved \"Water for Elephants.\" Tragedy, mystery, adventure, humor and romance -- this book has it all. This is the story of a young man who finds himself working as a veterinarian for a traveling circus during the Great Depression era, but it's really so much more. So, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and enjoy this masterpiece!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For me, this book reminded me of being a little kid.  I could picture myself sitting at the foot of my grandfather's bed as he told me stories of his youth and the adventures that came with it.  I was instantly transported to the 1930's and to the world of the traveling circus.  The author wrote with such clarity and viviid realism, that I was shocked when I later read that at the time she started writiing the novel, she has never been to a circus.  This novel is beautiful and moving, and certainly one that I will pass along to others."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story feels magical, while containing it's fair share of hard-hitting reality. It's a depression era story of a lost soul joining a traveling, American circus. It reads like a memoir of the story's main character, Jacob. The story begins in a modern day setting, where you meet Jacob as an elderly man, living in a retirement home.A circus is setting up just across the street from Jacob's retirement home, and the whole place is buzzing about it. It brings back Jacob's memories of his time traveling around the country with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. As a young man, he worked as their veterinarian.Jacob's relationships with the animals in the circus, as well as the crew members and performers are my favorite aspects of this novel. The author reveals that many of the most entertaining stories and plot twists concerning the animals were based on real occurrences. The author really did her homework, and it shows. The story line in endearing and entertaining."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My daughter has been asking me to read this book for years.  I resisted because I read the synopsis and thought \"a story about a circus in the era of the great depression? Nah.\"  I finally downloaded it and gave it a go and couldn't put the book down.  Seriously this is one of the best books I've read in years!  I felt like I was right there.  The narrative shifts back and forth between old Jacob and young Jacob seamlessly.  I strongly regret waiting so long to read this book.  And for you Nook/Kindle lovers, this book is only $5 to download.  I would have paid full price.  It is a haunting story and often had me thinking of my own aging.  What will it feel like to be inside a body that is old and doesn't function like it used to, yet the mind still feels young?  I can't wait for the movie to come out in April."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book because it was rated so highly and it was a NaNoWriMo novel. Somehow I made it to the bit that describes the old man having a shower which is about a 1/3 the way through according to my Kindle progress bar. I don't know how. I found it so incredibly vulgar that I just couldn't keep going. I didn't even care enough about the characters or the story to skip to the last few pages to find out what happened. In fact, I wish I could erase what I did read from my head and gain back the time I wasted reading it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Oh how I loved this book! The story is told by its main character, Jacob who is now confined to a nursing home, reminiscing about his time spent in the circus. It tells of Jacob's life travelling in a circus during the Depression and of the harsh conditions for the workers in during this time. There are so many great characters in this novel that have great depth to them, including Rosie the Elephant. This is much more than a novel about the circus, it has a great story that everyone should do themselves a favour and read! I'm looking forward to seeing whether the movie can capture just what a truly captivating story this novel tells. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished this book, and oh my word, what a fun, very quick read :-)  The story was wonderful and I loved the back and forth from the \"old\" Jacob to the \"young\" Jacob, the the past reality, to the current reality.The detail of the writing was so descriptive that I felt like I was in the hobo \"city\" or seeing the high trestle that Walter & Camel were thrown off of. It was just an amazing story, I'd suggest it to anyone, at any age."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wasn't sure about this - circus and elephants and all. I was afraid it was going to be about animal abuse and very sad. Well - there is that, but it's so much more than that. You'll be transported to a different time and a location most of us will never experience - the backdoor view of a circus. Each character is so real, I felt I could regonize them.  And although I wasn't even around when the story took place - at least the early part, I could picture everything right down to the smells and sounds! The author has a terrific grasp of aging as well. Sympathetic but not syrupy. The aged Jacob is quite a character as he struggles with the indignities associated with 'assisted' living and the recollections of a past - recollections that he was just now ready to reveal at age 90 or was that 93?"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've been seeing this book for years at book stores and amazon website but for some reason I wasn't interested. The idea of a novel that takes place in a circus didn't seem exciting to me. Then, the kindle version of the book is offered with a great price and I reluctantly buy it and even more reluctantly read it. What a surprise... I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. The main character, Jacob, is brilliant especially at old age. I learned a lot about circus life and people. I thought the ending was marvelous. Now, I have to watch the movie and see how it compares to the novel. Very enjoyable read and highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "WE was terrific out of the starting blocks, vivid and well-researched, replete with interesting characters.  Along the way, though, it increasingly took on the feel of a creative writing exercise -- ever lighter on research, weaker on character development, and thinner on plot.  In the end, I found WE disappointing.  Like many historical novels by contemporary young authors, WE is only shallowly situated in its particular historical context (depression era, circus).  Every now and then the author tosses in a cliched reference to food lines to remind the reader of the historical moment; otherwise, nothing to suggest the landscape (literal and figurative) through which the Benzini Brothers train chugs ever onwards.  I emerged from WE with far less of a feel for circuses or society in the 1930s, or for aging and the elderly today, than I should have.  WE reads like an entertaining short story stretched to the breaking point.  There just isn't enough 'there' there..."}

An easy coming-of-age  must-read to curl up by the fire with!(I can't say I'm surprised that the book is being turned into a movie, though it'll be interesting to see if the movie manages to capture the poignancy of the old man's recollections...)"}

Narrated by an old man, 90 or 93 he says. Who is (unhappily) living out his days at a nursing home. Ah but he wasn't always an old man.The book appears to have been carefully researched and many of the characters and incidents are based on actual people, animals and or occurrences in circus of times past.At times funny, sad, heartbreaking yet hopeful this one will stay with me for a long while. I highly recommend it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It had excellent character development and I had to keep reminding myself that it was fiction.  Since hearing about the dreadful Hartford circus fire from my mother (who had friends perish), I have always found it to be such an interesting topic.  This bridged the gap from story to reality by referencing some of the real aspects of the circus by utilizing that backdrop with an interesting storyline.  I cannot wait until the next book!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This audiobook was so well done! Two different readers provide for the voices of the man at 93, living in a rest home and his 23 year old self in memory. Alternate chapters keep the reader torn between hearing the story of Jacob and his experiences with a circus during the depression and his later self coping with another type of depression as he deals with a worn out body and his limited life as he waits to die. Anyone with compassion for older people will find this story heart wrenching and enlightening at the same time. Excellent!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The historical story was interesting and kept my attention, even though I think TOO MANY people here are giving Ms. Gruen too much credit.  Personally, I don't think she used enough historical fact and instead relied on a very formulaic plot-line that was very predictable, i.e. the love relationship, the MC and head of the animals will be foiled in the end, and the preposterous ending where our dear wonderful elephant kills the cruel animal director.  Too contrived for me.I can understand the popularity of this book.  I cannot understand why it's a runaway bestseller."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was afraid I was not going to be able to relate to this book as it begins when Jacob is ninety, or nienty three.  I assumed it was going to be about dealing with age and death, and, boy, was I wrong!  As soon as I started this book, I could not put it down.  I love how it hops from old Jacob to young Jacob.  It has mystery, love, suspense, and death...just to name a few.  It was so much more than the \"easy read\" I thought I picked up.  The characters had such depth, and you could truly feel their emotions. Who would have thought I would be so interested in the going-ons of circus life, but this book draws you in and makes you never want to leave the \"big top\"."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For me, this book was like making a dear friend, and then bidding him farewell. I tried to savor this story, but couldn't put it down either. I was so sad when I got to the last page and it was over.I think the other reviews cover the storyline well...and I'm not a fan of giving away endings, but in general, it has vivid character development, authentic to the period and circus era of the depression years... and despite some graphic scenes (which add to rather than take away), it was a great, great read.I suspect it will be hailed as one of summer 2008's top beach reads...and will be on my recommend list to anyone who will listen for a long time to come."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "After all the hype about this book, I finally gave in to reading a borrowed copy. I wanted to like it, truly I did.  I made it to page 164 with some effort.  The characters were not developed well enough for me to like them.  Also, I work with elderly people and the narrator as an elderly man was not altogether believable.What I did enjoy was learning a bit about the circus business  back in the 30s.Please if you know of some real 5-star novels, non-romance, let me know."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book when it was a Kindle deal of the day, although I had long had it on my wish list due to the many rave reviews it had received.  I have never been fascinated by circuses, so maybe that's why I didn't find this story to be very engaging.  The characters never seemed very real, and the story just seemed too implausible for my taste.  I did enjoy the device of having the protagonist tell the story from his point of view at age 90 and at 23, and I thought the chapters taking the 90 year old's viewpoint were far better written than the rest of the book.  While I didn't dislike the book, I certainly do not think it deserves the high praise bestowed upon it by the majority of the reviewers."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I do!  The story had me hooked - I felt like I was a part of this exotic traveling troupe and despite the horrors and sadness in it, I couldn't be pulled away.  Especially heart-rending was the author's detailed depiction of the heavy-laden post-depression days and what one tragedy can do to a person: turn his life upside down. The storyline had my emotions wrapped up in the circus, and in the next moment, broke my heart for the lonely old man in a nursing home.  Excellent read that pulled me in and caught my breath."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The various characters made this story interesting.  Each brought a part of every day life.  Some were misjudged.  I did not like the fact that one could not trust anyone well unless he/she were very well acquainted with each person.  the story was fascinating and circus life was presented as hard work, low pay, and no home for many.  I would recommend this book to imaginative spirits, and to those who trust and judge too easily and quickly.  There were some tender parts that were a relief from all the cheating."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a pleasure to have such a fascinating book  read to me by two great readers! The main character, a 93 year old man recounting his life is read by an actor whose rough, gravelly voice perfectly embodies the character. The main character, as a 23 year old, is read by a much younger actor. Together, these two readers turned this book into an unforgettable novel.Maybe the book is every bit as good as a read, but having had heard it on CD, that's the way I'd recommend you discover it, too!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "At the time of this review there are over 1,700 reviews posted so I won't bother to sum up the story but just my opinion of the book.I thought the book was simple to read, an interesting story and engaging characters.Even though this novel is not perfect and a standard \"boy meets girl\" story with a charming setting, the descriptions are colorful and the characters are a variety of misfits; but somehow it all works and comes together very nicely for an entertaining and well paced read.Granted, the book is not going to be put on a shrine of the scholarly literary Olympus, but to me this book felt as if I was reading a fairytale - and I tremendously enjoyed it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I spent most of this book wondering why Gruen chose to intersperse her primary story of a young man who found himself thrust into the circus life in 1931 with the musings of that same man at the age of 93.  The story of how Jacob came to be in the circus and what happened to him there seemed like enough to me, and Jacob's aged voice seemed unnecessary.  At the end of the book, though, I realized why she gave us both perspectives, and could hardly argue with her narrative device, as the closure it provides works so well."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As a person who usually reads non-fiction books about science and psychology, I thought I'd give myself a break and see what all the hype surrounding Water for Elephants was about. I was not disappointed. It was not the best book I've ever read, but it was very entertaining and a pretty quick read. I was explaining to someone that the story is very formulaic: guy wants girl, can't have girl, ends up getting girl - but it was set against a different backdrop than others. Sometimes that's exactly the kind of book you want to read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Nothing more satisfying than a novel with a pleasing ending, and this one does just that, it makes the reader feel content.The story is believable, has you cheering, despairing, and crying for the antagonist and protagonist,and can be thoroughly enjoyed by both men and women.The story takes the reader on a journey of a man who, in the midst of his veterinary college training, ends up hopping a circus train and changes his path dramatically.  It is told through the memory of the 90+ year old man who lived it and is recalling it from his current life in a nursing home.I rarely read books twice, but this is one I would revisit!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Gruen's novel is the story of one man's life.  It is presented both as a recollection of a 93 year old man reflecting on his youth, as well as the current story of the matured man.  The central story revolves around a character that drops out of school after a family tragedy.  Being the depression and few work opportunities available, the character finds himself working with a circus.  The author clearly researched the subject and provides historical photos to provide the reader assistance with the visualization.  Overall, the book was enjoyable up until the last chapter.  I feel like I would have been much happier if the author left this chapter off all together as it in implausible and affected my entire view of the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a WONDERFUL book about a slice of American life that not many people know about.  What was circus life like during the Depression? Don't let the topic discourage you from reading this book.  I was captured by the first line: \"I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other.\"  As I was reading this book, I could see the whole story play out in my mind as the author easily transitioned the storyteller from the present day back to the 1930's and his life on a circus train.  I can't say enough good things about this book.  Read it....It's a true winner!!!"}

No. (Although she doesn't contradict the claim, which has been made very publicly by one of NaNoWriMo's founders.) Was it still worth the read? Meh. I don't know. I guess. Whatever. It wasn't a waste of time to read it, but it didn't enrich me or leave me with any lingering thoughts or feelings about the book. As a matter of fact, I barely remember what it was about (I want to say circuses?). All in all, it was a zero balance book. Some good footnotes though. I'd definitely recommend those.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Life in the circus during the Depression is probably depicted very accurately; times were hard and people were desperate.  The circus setting for the book is excellent; but, in my opinion, the plot is somewhat weak and the ending was less than I had hoped for.As others have described the scenes vary from life in a nursing home to Jacob's past life in the circus.  I actually liked that juxtapostion and felt it was done well.  I loved the pictures in the book and felt they added a lot.  In short, not a bad read, just not as gripping as I had hoped it would be."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book definitely is number one on my list of favorite books (and I read A LOT).  The story is gripping, beautiful and a little sad in some parts.  It's one of those books that you start reading then constantly stop in the middle of whatever you're doing to read \"just one more chapter\".  The writer doesn't leave the reader hanging, wondering what happened to all of the characters but it's not a predictable ending.  Read this book, you will not regret it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For years, \"A Prayer For Owen Meany\" was my favorite book.  Until I read \"Water For Elephants\" for the first time.  I turned the last page and started all over again on page 1. I read it again after that.  I just love every sentence.  Jacob is a hoot!  The ending is the best ending ever!  Totally unexpected and totally true to character.  I live in Chicago, so the Chicago connection was one more sweet moment.  It's just such an all around loving, joyful book, with quirky surprises at every turn.  It made me laugh out loud.  I can't help it . . . I love everything about it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wanted to rate this a \"zero.\" WHY can't there be a minus stars rating. Totally disappointed. Over-the top melodramatic and predictable, especially since the ending is revealed in the first 5 pages. AWFUL, totally dreadful, prose. WHY, would ANY publisher (other than Harleguin Press) pick this tripe up! Thank god I got this from the library and didn't pay $$$ for this.I suspect this may be one of those rare instances where the film version might be better (but only if they make the orig novel unrecognizable). It certainly couldn't be any worse. I listened to the audio version while exercising and could not reach the fast-forward button--made my workouts twice as difficult. ;-)"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was an engaging story from start to finish. The author did a wonderful job telling Jacob Jankowski's story as an old man biding his time in an assisted living facility waiting to go to the circus, and as a young adult, who after finding himself homeless and parentless, jumps a circus train.I found the ending a bit surprising, but beautiful all the same. This was an easy read and something I couldn't put down. I love it when an author is truly able to bring you back to a time and place and make it so believable as Sara Gruen has done with Water for Elephants.Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen spins a yarn, more than just a circus story, filled with memorable characters (not all human, some at a crucial crossroads), and highly dramatic events juxtaposed with the loneliness of old age. Near the end of his life, Jacob Jankowski finds himself reminiscing about his salad days, as painful as they might have been. He knows life is about the pleasure and the pain; you can't have one without the other (like good and evil). After a tragic loss, Jacob finds a home with a traveling circus as a veterinarian and along the way he: loses his virginity, makes some true friends, learns some valuable life lessons, and falls in love. But above all this book is about his grand love affair, how it began and how it will end. Oh, and there's an elephant named Rosie mixed in there too. I recommend this strongly. 4.5 stars."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've just finished the book and liked it a great deal. Some of the research which underpins the book was outstanding. Depression era circuses, train circuses as Ms Gruen calls them, being a hobo on the rails, the brain of an elephant and the thread about Jamaican Ginger - all were fascinating - as was the almost seamless blending of the two time periods. Clearly the lady can absorb large quantities of research information and transform that into an excellent novel. She clearly, and obviously, loves animals. Will I buy the two other books listed here on Amazon? I don't think so but I am sure that horse lovers will and should."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is a small step up from chick-lit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it's what you're looking for.  A great read for the beach, or a good light read in-bewteen heavier or darker novels.As mentioned in other reviews, the character development was on the poor side, and the plot was pretty predictable (kind of hokey).  I felt the reading level was quite low, which made it a quick read, but not the brightest one.  Everything was pretty spoon-fed to the reader...there was no need for me to think about anything.  I prefer a bit more of a challenge."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had this book in my TBR pile and really wasn't in any sort of hurry to read it. Now, after finishing it, I can't believe I waited so long.This book gives me an in depth account of circus life during the depression and of the lifestyles of those who traveled with it. I learned a lot. I however, got really emotional when aspects of the book dealt with animal cruelty and even human cruelty to each other.This is a must read book. The ending is also a surprise."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story has a circus, a villain, an adventurer, and a love story. What else could a summer reader wish for? I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Granted, it's not Dickens, but it is great fun.Jacob's experience as the an old man reminded me so much of the nursing home my mother died in. His experience as a young man reminded me of the stories my father told about the depression, especially riding the \"freights.\"I passed this book along to a woman co-worker, and after she finished it, she said, \"I love this book!\"Sara Gruen did a marvelous job researching train circuses. That alone is worth the price of admission."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What is a life worth? How do you judge if someone is worth saving? What does it mean to be human? What or who is really an animal? Why can an individual choose how to live but not how to die? Who has the power to answer these questions? How do you know that person is right?Hidden beneath this easy-to-read though dark coming of age romance is a novel that prompts the reader to ask the above through the reminiscing of protagonist Jacob Jankowski who is prisoner in fact to old age and in feeling to a nursing home. The story begins as the circus rolls into town and the flood of Jankowski's past full of pleasure, joy, love, hate, regret & guilt washes over him.Sara Gruen brings the Circus Culture of the mid 20th century to life through meticulous research, both the bright spot light and the grittier nature of transitory existence. Anyone who ever dreamed of running away to the big top or just dreamed of running away should read this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book only because it was on my book club list. I had passed it up many times in my search for a \"good\" book to read. When it came time to read it for the book club I was not looking forward to it. All I can say now is WOW!!! I would have missed a great ride had I not been \"forced\" to read this WONDERFUL story. By the end I was cheering! I have since recomended it to many people and they all have had the same reaction. This is a keeper!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sure it is a well researched book.  The detail and description of circus life is very realistic and at times downright disgusting.  But what else does this book have that made one of my friends rave that this was the best book she had every read.  I'll tell you what....nothing.  I partly read this book on the recommendation of friend but I also wanted to read it because it was described as a murder mystery book.  A mystery murder it is not and by the end of this book I wanted all of the main characters to go away too!  I won't spill any beans but frankly this book deserved less time on the best seller's list and more time on the bottom of my discard pile (the books I will never read again or books that I would like to forget).  You make up your mind."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was my book club's book this month.  I don't always like what they pick, but I give each book 100 pages before giving up on it.  I liked this book immediately.The main character is in a nursing home and the story goes between his life there and his memories of his younger days when he worked for a circus.The imagery is excellent and you can feel the movement of the train as the author is describing the setup of the cars and where everyone rides.  You can smell the disinfectant in the nursing home when Jacob is there.I guess one of the reasons I liked this book is that I've never read something on this topic.  It was very interesting to learn about the different aspects of the circus and its struggle for survival.This is slower reading, you can't plow through it like one of those books you read on the beach, but you will enjoy every moment!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was recommended to me a 1000 times just by everybody (including Amazon). The thing is I thought it was going to be really depressing: a circus (they really depress me), great depression era.... and when I started reading it.... an old man in a home. Well, I finally thought, ok I HAVE to read it, at least to see why everybody is so in love with it, and now I am one of those people recommending it to everyone!Sara Gruen obviously has the gift of being a true story-teller, she just makes you read page after page completely forgetting your surroundings. The story is original, it has a drama and a force that absorbs you into it.If you want to have a great time reading or are looking for a special gift for someone: BUY THIS BOOK!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had to force myself to finish this and was continually disgusted with the animal cruelty. Maybe I should have stuck w/the gut instinct that I don't usually care for historical fiction? Gruen's insight into the minds of the aging is wonderful - she should have written something focusing on that. This book could also have been about 75 pages shorter and was painfully slow at times. The writing was not \"stellar\" - I just don't see all the hype but for the millions that loved it I'm glad for you - just be prepared if you haven't read it to wince w/some of the scenes."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was beautifully written. I felt so connected to the characters and the descriptions made the characters that much more vivid in my mind.The content regarding animal cruelty was hard to read for me. I cried a few times as I read them.With that said, I think it is beautiful and honorable for these elephants to be acknowledged and their names remembered as their stories are further shared with the world.The details in the book regarding the workers and the environment of the circus were accurate and well portrayed.I felt a connection with all of the characters not just their Marlena and Jacob."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book in September 2007. That means I had it in my drawer for almost five years and I just kept postponing reading it (I bought it along with many other books and it took me a while to read them all; then other books got on the way and so on).  When the movie came I refused to watch it knowing I should read the book first. And so I finally made up my mind and did it. It's a great book. I'm not a circus fan but the love story is precious. It was interesting to read about the Great Depression and how hard it was to make a living. I liked the pictures inside the book. I think they were a nice touch from the author. And of course I rented the movie and watched it after reading the book. Guess what? The book is better!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The book is okay so far, but I'm very distracted by the horrible Kindle formatting.  I've never had a problem with a Kindle book before, but this one is full of gaps and spacing problems. Dialogue is separated by abnormally huge gaps, but author-intended spaces intended to denote a pause are the same gaps as the extraneous ones; in other words, the intentional spaces are lost in the shuffle.  This makes the book very hard to read and follow, since I'm never sure if it's a \"Kindle\" gap or an \"author\" gap.  This was very poorly digitized.  It almost makes the book unreadable because it is such a distraction."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you want to feel the sorrow and excitement of joining the circus and the sorrow of old age in our country, Ms. Gruen could not have crafted a better story.  The protagonist, a Polish vet student, of all things, joins the circus and therein begins the story of corrupt managment, the wonderful animals and the class system among the workers and the performers.  The reader is provided with historical information while the author paints a vivid picture of the circus train and its dynamics.  She interweaves a touching love story and a strong respect for circus animals, espcially Rosie, the elephant who only understood Polish commands! Read it - you won't be wasting your time."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When this book came out in hardcover, I passed it by.  No interest in reading about circus freaks.  When the book came out in paperback, I passed it by.  Still did not sound interesting.  Three people recommended it to me and then, finally, a friend gave it to me after she finished it.  Still, I waited a month or so before beginning it.  Within the first few chapters, I was intrigued.  I loved the descriptions - created a definite picture in my mind.  I loved the characters - I wanted to know what would happen to them.  Although I thought the end was somewhat predictable, on the whole, I found this a very enjoyable read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was torn between two or three stars. I read this book for my book club, otherwise it is unlikely I would have picked it up considering my backlog.Personally I didn't find anything wow-ish or over the top astounding with this story. Besides that it takes place in a circus. It had its moments of course, which makes me think that what really makes you like a book is not sometimes the overall story, but a couple of scenes that really stand out. And this had a handful of those, especially those set in the present time, which were the only ones to actually pull my emotional strings, which usually doesn't take much I'm afraid, and considering that this book didn't stir much in me overall. Not even the traditional `big twist' scene riled me up. I actually read a paragraph past it then did a double take on `oh that was suppose to be it'."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A very good read!  The story as related by Jacob, alternated between the present when he's already 90 or 93 and during the 1930s when he was 23 and traveling with the circus.  It talked about loss, love, friendship (odd and otherwise), fellowship, family.  The book is full of so much emotion that even if I have not been to a circus all my life, and given that I am a woman, I was able to transport myself into Jacob's mind, and feel the story.  I just wish there was more to read after the old Jacob got himself into the circus \"train\" again."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Jacob Jankowski is a student at Cornell Veterinarian School.  He gets the heart-breaking news that his parents have died in a car crash.  In the throes of the great depression, Jacob finds out there is nothing left of their estate.  He tries to finish his exams but cannot.  Jacob takes the next train out of town.  Inadvertently, he finds himself on the Benzini Brothers Circus train.  Jacob is hired on and becomes immersed in the circus life.  He also falls in love with Marlena, one of the star performers married to August, the equestrian trainer.  Jacob is telling his story some 70 years later as a 93 year old patient in a nursing home.  Present day happenings are interspersed with his memories of life back in '31.  The circus chapters start with historical photographs lending to the authenticity of events.  Mesmerizing writing, fascinating characters, and actual documented circus events combine to make this an exceptional novel to enjoy!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The story was good but had too many swear words for my taste. The circus storyline was very interesting (ie, how a circus works, what happens behind the scenes, etc). I was also surprised to find a good description of getting old. If you're interested in reading just that part of the book, skip the chapters with pictures at the beginning. In doing so, you'll also skip most of the foul language.I've given this book 3 stars, but it really should be 2 and a half."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I would have never believed that I would have enjoyed this book. Let alone enjoyed it to the extreme level which I did. A well respected friend recommended this book to me so I pull it up online and read the synopsis. Well, the synopsis and subject matter regarding circus life in the mid 1900's did not interest me in the least bit. Suffice to say I did not immediately read it. Only after subsequent prompting from my friend did I agree to give it a shot. That turned out to be an EXCELLENT idea. It was clear and concise reading that gave me vivid images of that era and written with short chapters that propelled me along to read just a little more each time since I was skeptical from the start. The story recounted through the eyes of an old man reminiscing his youth was pulled off seamlessly. It was like reading two stories. Now, after reading the book for myself I'm amazed at the few negative reviewer's comments. I'm reminded that some people complain about everything."}

I felt like i was riding along, like i was a part of the circus!Jacob Jankowski : \" I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other.\" Jacob is living in a senior citizen home, grumpy, depressed and starting to lose his memory . The author does a wonderful job of alternating between Jacobs story of his life in the circus and his current life.The details of circus life, the struggles, the sadness and the happy times.I highly recommend reading this one. On a scale of 1-10 this definitely gets a 10!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "How many novels have you read about the circus? This was certainly my first and that's what I loved about it - it was something out of the ordinary. The story flowed smoothly and was full of great stories. I read a review stating that the characters weren't realistic, August was too horrid and Jacob was a coward. I definitely disagree and found most, if not all, the characters to be believable.My only complaint is the vocabulary in the novel. It seemed the author was going out of her way to use synonyms fairly close together within the plot. While I don't mind challenges to my vocabulary I didn't find it believable as if the story was really told from one person's point of view it is doubtful that they would use such extreme variety in word choices. This is nit-picking though, overall I really enjoyed the journey!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was so taken by this story when I first started reading it that I told my Mom about it, suggesting that she would love it. I was almost finished with the book when my Mom passed away. When going through her things, I found a copy of \"Water for Elephants\", and it really hit me hard emotionally, much like Jacob's feelings when his parents died (my Mom died from a neural hematoma after slipping on a step ladder). Now, almost five years later, I was able to bring myself to finish reading this wonderful tale, and I am so glad I did."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a wonderful story.  I first heard it on Chapter A Day and just finished reading it to fill in the parts I'd missed.  The extra bonus in reading the book is seeing all the fascinating historical pictures Gruen gathered from various circus museums.  I loved that some of the amazing things that Gruen discovered in her research about circus were woven into the story.  She began her research into the world of circus life by contacting Circus World Museum in Baraboo, WI which we have been to and love.  Gruen's book has added a whole new dimension to the world of the circus."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "WATER for ELEPHANTS was a quick and mostly enjoyable read for me.  The story of Jacob, a young man on the verge of his career as a veterinarian, was told as the flashback of a much older Jacob, who now resides in a nursing home.  As young Jacob was about to take his final exams and graduate from vet school, his world crumbled when his parents were killed in a car accident.  Left without family or money, a despondent Jacob jumped on a passing train.  He soon found himself working as a vet for a traveling circus.  The story of young Jacob's adventures with the circus is interwoven with the story of old Jacob's life as a resident in a nursing home.  I loved the book, but I found parts of it too graphic.  There were sexually explicit passages as well as descriptions of violent animal abuse, which I felt were overdone and unnecessary to the story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As a devoted historical fiction reader, I thought this book would interest me. It did not. Water for Elephants reads like a children's novel, save for excessive and serious profanity, graphic and frequent sex scenes, and violence so vivid I was moved to nausea. If you are able to ignore those sorts of things, you will not find yourself feeling any kind of sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The characters do not develop over the course of the story, and seem only concerned with dabbling in vice. As a result, I was unable to identify with them.A portion of the story is written from the point of view of the main character in his old age. This writing is exceptional, and managed to keep me interested during the course of the book. Still, these marvelous little glimpses of author Sara Gruen's potential do not permit me to recommend this book to anybody. Avoid it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was a bit apprehensive about reading this book, but found it surprisingly refreshing in its approaches (spoken from two time periods) and its treatment of life as part of a circus \"family.\"  While the senior perspective was somewhat depressing, it was quite vivid of how one can be forgotten when one has so much life left to live and so much to share.  I also liked reading the excitement of the junior perspective, his trials and tribulations.  I think that both could have easily been expanded and still kept the reader's interest - wanted to know more about each character who are one and the same!  Bravo!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Could not put this book down, read from front to back and held on tight.  Without giving the good stuff away, you are there in the book at all times....amazing....wonderful.The twist on Jacob from the Bible (which you won't notice unless you read the Bible) is a grabber!We all will get old some day.....and if you are close, give this book to family members waiting to put you in a nursing home.  I think what got me the most was  \"pay attention\".I don't even want to see the movie...this was good enough for me!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've actually read this book twice--once because some friends recommended it, and then a few years later I read it again when the movie came out.  I thought the story was fascinating about a young man whose veterinary education is interrupted and he hops a circus train.  He becomes the circus vet and his whole life changes. Of course this all happens during the Great Depression.  I guess I liked this book because of the background research by the author about circuses during that period.  The old photos were charming as well. Like another reviewer mentioned not all of the facts regarding the care of animals may have been accurate but it's a fictional story and I think you have to give some license to that.  It's a book you would take on the plane or to the beach just to enjoy!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love reading books which captivate me so much that I constantly think about them; the characters, the plot...what's going to happen. When I was a child, Enid Blyton's books did the same thing for me. Sara Gruen is the kind of author a lot of people (including me) should aspire to be like.  Although this is a ficticuous novel, some of the events are true...Ms. Gruen should be applauded  for doing such an excellent job weaving past events with fiction. Her writing style is superb. Most people will probably start reading the book and think they know the ending......you won't!  That's how brilliant this author is.I highly recommend this book...and, oh, in addition, I would LOVE to see the next traveling circus.  (Do they still exist?)"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a lovely story this was! I feel like it was witten for hollywood, I cant wait to see the movie. I loved the fact that the story was remembered by an old man. The author REALLY got what it feels like to be old and she makes you get it also. I felt like I was right in the story, I read through this wonderful book in a few days. My only complaint is that it wasnt a little bit longer. This is only about 300 pages but I felt it should have been more."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I held off reading this book because everyone I knew who had read it or was reading it loved it but kept referring to it as \"depressing\" or \"violent\" or with other strong negative adjectives.  I wasn't in the mood for a \"downer.\"  Nothing else in my \"recommended for you\" list appealed to me so I downloaded the free sample.  This book is everything everyone said it would be...violence, cruelty, betrayal, death but somehow the story grabs you and won't let go.  Told by a 90 or 93 year old vet from a circus, the story is as personal as a biography and engrossing as a news account of the circus in the 1930s.  I read it in 24 hours.

But it's about the circus in the early years....not the big stadium circuses we see today.The story is narrated by a 90-year old man in a nursing home.  He worked in the circus when he was younger, and when he sees a circus setting up down the street, he begins to reminisce.  The story is told in two eras, that of the man's young years with the circus (during the Depression) and that of the man's present time in the nursing home.I have to say that I looked forward to getting back to the book every day.  I truly enjoyed it.  It's action packed, thoughtful, and different.  I read this book very quickly!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this novel for my Nana long before it was made into a movie - she loved it and raved about it to everyone. I felt very proud to have picked a good book for her. A few years later I read it myself and I fell in love. This book is delicious and a real treat. You will fall in love with every character and you will not want the circus to end.Even if you have watched the movie - you should read the book - it is (as always) so much more than the movie."}

My dad traveled  with the circus five years when he was young, When I was young we went to every circus within 50 miles and I got to spend time in the back where most people do not see, Loved seeing and petting all the animals.  We stayed until cars were all loaded on thetrain. At that time the horses brought the cars to the tracks and then the elephants pushed them upon to the train. My Dad saw all but 2 of the states. I miss the real circus , The ones today are only so so."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I adored Water For Elephants when I read it the first time, but it was on my second reading that I realized the extreme skill Gruen exhibits on every page and in every scene. Her prose is crisp and exacting, and her characters are so vivid, they leap to life in this story that grabs hold of you and  doesn't let go. I was literally transported to another place in time. I can't recommend Water For Elephants highly enough. This book deserves all the praise it's received and then some. What a beautiful novel--a treasure for all who curl up with this gem!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was hooked from the beginning and looked forward to coming back to the story each time I had to turn off my Kindle.  Coming of age in a circus might seem cliche yet the insiders view of the social dynamics that existed within a circus really put context around the whole \"running away to join the circus\" thing; although, in this case, it might be more apt to describe this as \"stumbling into the circus\".  Regardless, while I felt the end of the circus component of the story was somewhat predictable, it didn't spoil the story for me.  A truly remarkable story that I will enjoy again and again."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a very interesting read because it describes, in great detail, a segment of life in the US that is not often known and was experienced by relatively few people. The story revolves around a traveling circus and the many characters who live with and work for the show. I will not go into any detail about the story other than to say that it is very well written, in a style that allows the reader to really see what is going on. Without giving away anything, the story is told from the perspective of the main character as he recounts the events that happened so many years ago. What happens to him at the very end is what generated the discussion. Was it a realistic ending or just a romanticized but unrealistic conclusion to the story? I urge you to read it and post your thoughts here."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a fantastic read. I had seen the movie and I wanted to read the book as well. I am so glad I did. Though the movie followed it very well, the book gives you more in-depth information that leads you along, their thoughts and some of the behind the scene activity that the movie could not show.Sara Gruen is a marvelous writer and so descriptive with her writing. You could almost smell the sweat of the men, the hay, the booze. You could hear the music and feel the drums pounding as the animals entered the Big Top.The story was so well told that it made you feel what Jacob felt both as a young man and as a 93-year-old man.I highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just love it when the circus comes to our town and when I read \"Water for Elephants\" I was impressed with Sara Gruen research into several topics: the circus life and the great depression. I'm not sure how Ms. Gruen, managed to get herself into the head of a 93-year-old man but I loved the old man that narrated the story.The story is a mysterious and historical tour of behind the scenes of circus life. The deception and downright cruelty takes place. As far as I was concerned, Rosie the lovable elephant was the star of all the animals' maybe it's because I just love elephants.I won't go into detail about the story because other reviewers have already done a terrific account of the story. I would like to add that I found myself still thinking about the long suffering of the animals long after I finished the book. In summary the romantic scenes were weak but still a great story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen has created an engaging memoir narrated by the nonagenarian veteran and veterinarian of a depression-era circus.  Her research into the caste hierarchy and politics of train circuses reveals a world which, much like HBO's Deadwood, had its own laws of lawlessness and morality of immorality.  Into this world Jacob Jankowski is unwittingly dropped, and the recounting of his evolution from inheritor of his father's veternary practice to circus vet to aged resident of an assisted living facility is almost always convincingly told.  While Jacob may be the hero/narrator, it is most definitely Rosie the elephant who steals the show and wins your heart.  Like the rubes who paid their nickels and dimes to gawk at the freaks, I felt my $14.37 was well spent for a 332-page peek behind the big-top."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First of all, this book was waaaaay more sexual than I thought it would be. If you are getting it for a friend because they like elephants and the title has \"elephant in it\" DON'T DO IT (long story). This was a crazy story: funny at times and also sad at times. The story was told by switching between the past and the present, which was confusing at first, but made sense later. This style of writing kept the story moving; the shift from the old senile man to the young eager man developed the main character in such a way that it was difficult to put the book down. I enjoyed reading this book and I reflected on it for a while after I finished reading it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book! Honestly the only reason I picked it up was because of the movie with Robert Pattinson (yes, I know...I rarely justify the reading of a book with an actor).  I really enjoyed the time setting for this book and the behind the scenes look at the life of a circus worker back then.  I also liked how the entire book wasn't just a love story and how nicely it was framed within the overall novel.  This is definitely a book that I would recommend and read again! And just as a side note, the move was awesome as well!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Jacob Jankowski runs away from his ivy league veterinary education when his parents die in an accident and joins a circus on impulse. His training serves him well and provides him a place of esteem among the performers and the workers, an odd position which spans both groups. He falls for the lovely Marlena who performs with the horses, but she is married to August, a violent but charismatic animal trainer. The story culminates when the circus purchases an elephant named Rosie whose intelligence hides behind her thick skin.Some of the best scenes in this book are those in the nursing home when Jacob is an old man who can't remember if he is 90 or 93. The writing is sensitive, believable, and these moments are some of the most emotional snippets from the book. That is not to say that the rest is boring. Gruen has written a real page turner, and although it is not entirely original, it is incredibly entertaining."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is an amazing book.  The author took my mind into places I just did not want to go, into what it means to be a person at the end of life, still coherent but old and sick and living in a nursing home.At the end of your life, is that all that's left to hope for, that you end up in a nursing home with kids younger than your grandchildren bossing you around and moving you back to your room against your wishes after an argument with another nursing home resident?  Is this what the end of life means, an adult becomes a dependent child who must be bossed around by others, even if that person's mind and intellect are still intact?  Wow.  Of course I know these things happen, but never in fiction have I seen the final years of a person's life etched to the pages in such an emotional and moving way."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants was recommended to me by a co-worker, and I was really surprised at how much I liked it. A book about a circus didn't necessarily appeal to me, but I figured it was worth a shot.This story is great. I really enjoyed the way the story alternated between Jacob in present day and Jacob's memories. In both times, he was heartwarming and sincere, even if he could be a bit cranky in his older age. :)The characters were great--well-developed and dimensional, even the ones you didn't particularly like. The whole circus feels very vivid, and I just loved Rosie to death.Overall, it was just a very enjoyable read with enjoyable characters (well, mostly, unless they weren't supposed to be). One thing that I found unexpectedly interesting was the circus dynamic--the cruelty, the hierarchy, the crazy characters. All in all, this is a very well-rounded novel and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a wonderful and delightful book! This is a look thru the eyes of a 93-year young man of his experiences with the circus mixed with today.  What an experience he had in years gone  by; what we do to our elders now because we are too busy with our own  daily lives. This has an absolutely magnificent ending...something quite unexpected and heartwarming. I hope there is a circus in town when I get to Jacob's age and my family is busy with their life. I think I would make a great ticket taker."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Written in the first person perspective, this story explains the life of an circus worker back in the old days, before any regulations were ever thought of.Rough and rugged lives wherein the guy with all the power hasn't much thought or care to the value of life - be it animal or human - but Karma wins in the end!Well written, kept my attention enough to loose sleep so I could keep reading it.As always, the book is better than the movie.  Read the book first and you will most likely understand the movie better."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this novel.  I am disappointed in the reviews that say the characters are too far fetched and the romance was unrealistic.  Its a fictional novel that explores a vet-school drop out, Jacob, who joins a circus by chance and falls in love.  The story he tells about life in the circus was thrilling and had me wanting to read more.When the chapters skip back to elderly Jacob, we see how he has gone through a lot in his early lives.  I love that he lives at an assisted living and tells his view of his life.The ending made me so happy and I couldn't stop smiling.  WELL worth it.  I might skip the movie because I am fearful that it will not give me what the book did!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I finished this book only because I felt like I had to. I suppose it was well researched and written because I felt the same way about reading it that I feel going to a county fair or local carnival: a little grimy, a little ashamed, a little grossed out. It's not a glamorous life and it wasn't a good time, economically speaking. The writer definitely gets that across. The content was just a little disturbing to me. But for those who like a dark and somewhat gritty story, this is probably really enjoyable. Just not for me."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "To me, the mark of a good book is when you don't want to see it end. And when it does end, you can't stop thinking about it. That's how this book was to me. The characters were so richly drawn that I actually felt like they could be real people. When some of the injustices happened I had to remind myself that this was fiction. Sara Gruen writes this amazing story against a backdrop of the Great Depression and that adds so much to the story. I can't say too much about it without giving away important plot points, but I did not see the big twist coming. I'm surprised I didn't, as all the signs were there, but I was just so engrossed in the story that I didn't put them together. This is a book I will read again and again."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "We listened to this on a road trip out west and I loved it! The story itself was a great leave from my everyday, but the voices were fantastic! I loved hearing cantankerous 90 (or 93..) year old Jakob tell his tale. If you enjoyed reading this book, I'm sure you will love it more hearing the tale from the two Jakobs. If you haven't read the book, there is a good chance you will be drawn in by the storytellers and end up loving it. We sat in the car after we arrived home for the last 10 minutes of the book we were so enthralled.Get this and listen to it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was a pleasure.  It is meaningful enough to warrant the time to read it and yet it is still fun and engrossing enough for a good poolside read while on vacation.  The protagonist's world is shredded near the beginning and he does what readers of this review would dream of but never do.  He hops a circus train and enters that most bizarre of American sub cultures of the depression era 1930's.  Read this and live vicariously in the circus from the comfort of your hotel's patio furniture.  You'll be glad you did and you'll feel more literate than if you read most of the trash you see at other chairs around the pool."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book.  It was breath-taking alive - as if I could smell it, taste it and feel it.  It was like I became lost in the Great Depression era.  I so wanted it to end so that I could hear the conclusion of Jacob's life with the circus, but I didn't want it to end because it was such an enjoyable book.  I liked the way the story was narrated by Jacob as a young man and as an old man.  It is hard to believe that this was not an autobiography."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I didn't realize this was such a controversial book until I came to write my review. I liked the book. It is fast paced and an easy read. I did not like the explicit sexual scenes; I don't think they added anything, other than showing Jacob was nave, which we knew anyway. I didn&#8217;t like the animal abuse, and the fact that he was a vet and didn&#8217;t do anything about it, but if he would have he probably would have been red-lighted. The author did a lot of research about the circus in that era and it was interesting to read about some of the things that really did happen."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book based ( embarrassingly) on the attraction of the trailer. however, upon reading the book, I have to say that it outperformed my wildest expectations. I loved the characters, their imperfection and their depth.  Gruen's Narrative is vivid, exciting, passionate, and at times heartbreaking. the personalities of the animals and their role in the main characters interaction (and livelihood) in and out of the circus; are really moving.  I also found it refreshing that the main character's reasons for join the circus are not the norm. I did find the leading lady a bit flat at times, and the summation at the end left a little to be desired, but the ending was still perfect."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book is one of my all-time favorites because I loved the main character and the woman he fell in love with, but most of all, I loved the adventure of the traveling circus. Gruen had to have done a major league amount of research to learn what the circus was like in the 1920s. And my guess would be that she really did meet a man like the main character. Otherwise, how could he be so believable and so lovable?I have lent this book to several people. I know the author prefers to hear that everyone bought their own copy and I get it. But \"Water for Elephants\" is a book everyone should read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When I first read the title and the back of this book,  I wasn't the least bit interested.  However --- two of my sisters, my daughter,  and my niece were reading the book at the same time --- and all four of them loved it and recommended it highly.  I had to get it --- and I had to agree with them!  Its a great story!  One that is amost impossible to put down!  I highly recommend this read!  I just hope the movie doesn't ruin it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was captivating from page 1.  The story kept a good pace and is one of those books you just don't want to put down.  I really connected with the main character and felt his emotions as if they were my own.  Other characters were both likable and despicable, but all the while intriguing.  A very interesting story and enlightening as well.  I can imagine life on a circus train during the depression and realize now that it was not all it was cracked up to be.  Highly recommend!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this, but I picked it up at a garage sale on the cheap.  The storyline was completely engrossing and I couldn't put it down.  I know nothing about circus life, so I can't comment on whether or not the circus elements are factual.  I do have experience both working in and visiting nursing homes and the descriptions here sadly ring true.  A review on the cover described the book as gritty and sensual and it is certainly both in a very entertaining way.  One of the few books that I immediately wanted to read again as soon as I finished it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Really great book. The characters are interesting, particularly our hero Jacob. The setting is vibrant (a circus during the Great Depression.) The plot moves at a great pace, and the material is really well researched. All of which comes together under some excellent writing that provides just enough detail to make everything real and interesting without banging you over the head with it. Throw in murder, sex and a big elephant wearing pink sequins, and you have a fab book. The very end is charming too. I highly recommend it"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I don't read a lot of fiction these days because I don't havethe time, but I picked this book up from my Mom over my summervacation...And boy was I glad I did. Some books do more thancapture your mind; they create a certain feeling or emotionthat captures your heart too. This is one of those books.The author's voice has a certain cadence and style that sucksyou in from page one. And what seems to be a simple tale ofdepression-era circus life with an obvious outcome soon takesunexpected twists and turns to a surprise ending that had melaughing and crying at the same time.If you read one novel this year, I'd highly recommend this one.It ranks right up there with many of my all time favoritebooks."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you were a kid and experienced the train arriving, the parade of elephants, and the setting up of the big tent, this book will inform you of what went on behind the extravaganza!  I saw the performers outside with their buckets, but who would ever imagine what their lives were like?  I went to the side shows, ate the cotton candy and this book brought it all back!  This is a great novel with circus history that I fully enjoyed!  A perfect ending to those who wonder about Jacob's future!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen's prose is straightforward and simple, her research of Depression-era circus life impeccable.  With a gentle hand, she transports the reader back to a time and place most of us could never imagine. Along the way, her rich characters--Jacob, the young protagonist whose world implodes as he readies himself for life as a veterinarian, Marlena, the beautiful circus performer he falls in love with, and August, her psychotic husband and head trainer of the 'Worst Show on Earth'--leap off the page.  Water for Elephants is a rickety train ride into the dark, seedy, melancholy world of the 1930s circus performer.  But it's a trip worth taking.  Your final destination is not a place of misery and despair but one of love and hope.  And the ending is guaranteed to soften the hardest of hearts.Salmon Run"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First the title, Water for Elephants is quite interesting. It catches my eye and has been since I saw it on the bookshelf. Finally with a copy of my own, Sara Gruen's writing style is quite detailed and specific but she has abundant of information and allows the reader to understand Jacob Jankowski, the widowed 90 year old man. In writing about the loss of his parents, he writes how he discovered that his parents mortgaged their home to send him to Ivy league college, probably Cornell University. He drops out and finds himself working at the circus by providing water for elephants. We know he was married for 60 years. The sccene in the lawyer's office discovering his parents' lack of estate was heartbreaking and typical depression era story. The fact that the great depression and stock market crash of 1929 is still relevant in today's literature. Sara Gruen makes accountability for explaining the details of Jacob Jankowski's life."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really wanted to like this book, I really enjoyed learning some of the slang and history of the circus.  I like the circus and I was told I'd fall in love with the animals and the characters of this book.  The fact is I hated the raunchy descriptions surely we could do without those.  I felt the book to be dark, twisted and weird.  I did indeed love the animals but didn't like the characters.  Honestly - I only read half the book because of these things.  Too bad."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is my second review on Amazon.  I seriously have a lot of catching up to do.I love books about animals as I am such an animal lover myself.  The read was cool, which hotted up at the end, although a little slow moving to begin with.  In the second half I couldn't put it down, I had to know the ending as I was on tender hooks all through the time.  I guess part of this story was very emotional.  Well worth a read despite the slow beginning."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A good friend of mine who is a Veterinarian, recommended this book to me several years ago. Based on her review, I purchased the book and it sat on my bookshelf for three years!! I considered reading it several times, but it was always passed over in favor of other novels that sounded more intriguing. Once I started seeing trailers for the movie adaptation of the novel with Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson, I finally extracted the book from its place in the bookshelf and read it. THANK GOODNESS I did! Water for Elephants is a brilliantly written account of a Veterinarian student who loses his parents in a car crash and ends up joining a circus in a chance encounter. The author clearly depicts what circus life was like in the 1930s and builds larger than life circus folk whose personalities bounce off of the novel's pages. I highly recommend Water for Elephants, it's a story of loss, love, animals, circus shenanigans, and betrayal. It's a fun romp with a great ending that you'll thoroughly enjoy."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It's not always that a popular novel lives up to the hype...but this one absolutely does!What I most enjoyed about this book was that it was unique from most other books that I've read.  I was transplanted to a place and time that I'd never been or really thought about before...a LIFE I'd never thought about.  It was really fascenating and I learned quite a bit about the circus, although some I didn't want to know.  I will caution that this book has some very graphic animal abuse scenes.Overall the story kept me reading, the characters and their lives were interesting and dynamic...even though some were not likeable.  The time passed quickly as I was reading, I was curious to see how it would end.  I dare say this was one of the better endings to a novel that I've read, I'd put it up that high for sure.  Full circle."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Dreadful.  Judging from the first paragraph, this novel had the potential for being absorbing and a good holiday read.  I was soon only making my way through it because I had nothing else to read and I kept thinking it must get better since it came highly recommended.  If only I had had something better than this time waster: lazy plot that never seemed to go anywhere because it went in too many irrelevant directions, little firsthand knowledge of the circus, low-level vocabulary.  A waste of time on a good topic."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love when you open a book and start reading, and you visualize yourself right there.  Not only do you see things, you can smell the aromas in the air, and you are stopped just short of touching.  You stand there witnessing the events going on around you.  You can not stop them, you can not change them, but you are feeling the feelings of everyone there.  I did not want this book to end.  This book had me emotional from the beginning to the end, and even beyond."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book is one of the best books I have ever read!  I would recommend this book to everyone and have already passed it on to my Mother who also LOVED it!!  This is one of those books that stick with you and even when you've moved onto other books, you'll find yourself thinking about it still.  I will NEVER look at an elephant or a circus in the same way.  I laughed and cried several times and just can't say enough good things about this book.  It is one of those books that I don't think I will ever forget, it touched me very deeply."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this book. From the opening line on Chapter 1 all the way to the end, you are hooked.A young veterinary student loses is parents tragically during the time of the depression. After having his family house repossesed by the bank and no prospects, he winds up working in a circus.As stated in other reviews, there are some shaky transitions and predictable plot points. But there is a sincerity to the book that works and unique setting that makes one easily forgive the story's few shortcomings.And it's the setting that I really liked about this book. It brings back the circus of old and it made me miss it. The smell of animals and hay. The popcorn and cotton candy. The acrobats with the sequined vests. You get a wonderful \"behind the scenes\" insight to a peice of nostalgic Americana. Combined with classic dramatic elements and a motley cast of characters, this is a great book and I'm glad I got it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book is well written, well researched, and overall an interesting story. That said, without a doubt I would have closed it and never finished it due to the abuse of the animals, but I read until the end it because it was a book club choice. This is not a book for animal lovers and I found it to be incredibly painful. Those who torture animals are the scum of the earth in my opinion and I don't enjoy reading about them. Nothing personal Sara Gruen, you are a good writer."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I simply don't understand the fanfare.  Every bit of this story was heartbreaking.  The animal abuse (especially Rosie), the human abuse (Walter and Camel, especially), and all of the heartbreaking things that happened at the hands of certain men.  What was there to enjoy about this story?  Revenge at the end?  Ok, so I liked the last 3 pages.  But those last 3 pages didn't make up for my sadness throughout the whole of this book.  I wish I hadn't read it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a great vacation read.  The book is engaging and easy to read.  The author has paralleled the story of Jacob into a depression era love and life story that takes place in a circus.  In Water For Elephants, Jacob steals the love of another man's wife.  The man is cruel and probably mentally ill.  Jacob's heartrending moral dilemma over his love for Marlena amid all the circus characters and their individual tales forms the struggle in the novel. While the novel is character driven, it has plenty of action.  I agree with another reviewer that this book would make a good movie. I gave this 4.5 stars.  It is good not great literature."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A 90+ gentleman (sharp as a tack) in a nursing home watches from the window as a circus comes to town.  He takes us back in time to his own \"carny\" days as a veternarian for the circus animals.  So far sounds boring as heck, doesn't it?  Well, this is one old gent you come to really like.  We learn a lot about the shenanigans behind the scenes of the circus as well as the plight of those during the depression.  Again, sounds boring.  But this author makes it a story you can't put down.  This is a testament to a great writer.  I believe she could make the phone book interesting.  JUST READ IT !!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I give this book a 2.6.  All those people Jacob's father helped in that little town and no one came forward in his time of tragedy?  It just didn't seem realistic to me.  Someone from immigrant stock with the pluck and drive to get into Cornell vet school is not likely to founder in this situation, nor just dismissively to walk away from his final exams.  Jacob wasn't a pampered trust fund baby; he'd probaby had it a bit rough all along. The rest of the story is just a contrivance built upon an unbelievable premise."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had not read Sara Gruen's work when my book club decided to read Water for Elephants...now I am a big fan! The writing is clear and engaging, the story is filled with vivid characters (including Rosie the elephant), and the action is well paced. Gruen seamlessly interweaves the story of an aging ex-circus vet and his recollections of the exciting (and often dangerous) road show days. With her interesting research into the carny heyday, Gruen transports the reader into another world, including the fascinating vocabulary of the performers and roughnecks. A lovely story!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book. While it has history it is not a dull history book and the history is indeed interesting. The book details the lives of different people enveloped in the gold rush from a wonderful clergy man ,a young Irish woman with a keen sense for business, successful and not so successful miners plus those who went there with no knowledge of mining or life in the very rugged north.The book is very well written and weaves the history, the town of Dawson, and the individual characters together seamlessly."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "To me Hemingway epitomizes the hard drinking, hard living, hard loving, worldy writer. In this book, the main character Robert Jordan is a soldier send on a mission to the hills of Spain to blow up a bridge. There, Jordan meets up with a rogue band of warriors who believe in war but not in military. Once united with the militia, Jordan becomes involved with a woman named Maria. The fight scenes are incredible. The ending is even more incredible. I'm not going give away the book, but the ending  brought tears to my eyes- I guess it's true, underneath every man of steel is a heart of gold."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "An interesting historical novel set in the context of Revolutionary Spain, but classic Hemmingway, it carries with it the important lesson of activism over apathy, especially pertinent to today's world.  It teaches that ideals transcend political boundaries and that if you believe in something strongly, then you owe it to yourself to protect that ideal in any part of the world and at any cost, even that of your life.  Intwined is a beautiful love story.  One of my top 5 greatest books of all time.  Thats a rave, baby.  The poem by John Donne at the beginning makes the book worth buying.A 5 because it is a great story with an invaluable lesson.  If you gain nothing, you still read beautiful prose by one of the greatest authors ever."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For Whom the Bell Tolls takes the reader on a three and a half day journey starring Robert Jordan who is assigned with blowing up a bridge. He is in Spain and the fighting is between fascists and the Republicans (Robert Jordan&#8217;s side). It accounts his time with a group of guerrilla fighters.While the writing drags on at times and in the beginning it is difficult to tell what or whom the dialogue is between, it is a pretty good book. Topics such as love &#8211; between Maria and Jordan, the psychology of soldiers, and who God is are covered in this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is by far my favorite book ever.  I am sure many other people will lay out the plot for you in their reviews, so I will tell you what I loved about it.  I love the bravery and leadership of the main character Robert  Jordan, I loved how Hemingway used people such as the strong willed Pilar  and other characters to only make it seem more realistic, and I mostly love  how Hemingway painted a picture with Robert Jordan that is the example for  all people who want to see what bravery is.  No author could top this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What could be better than Hemmingway?  More Hemmingway.I learned about this short epilogue on the program \"Hemmingway in Cuba\" was broadcast April 6, 2013 on my local pbs station.  There is a joint effort by Cuban and American scholars to preserve all the materials left at his home in Cuba.  I am not a scholar, but want to share this with other readers of Hemmingway.This Epilogue for \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" was found in the basement of Finca Vigia.EpilogueIt was night when Golz rode in a staff car on the road down from the pass to El Escorial."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book has everything.  War, Romance, and the little known history of the Spanish Civil War.Hemingway is at his best in this book.  His keen journalistic eye doesn't miss a detail.Although the era he is writting about has long since gone by the reader cannot help but be pushed back in time.There is one scene that always sticks in my mind.  I think Pablo's mujer is telling Robert Jordan about a village they \"cleaned\" of fascist.  The details of the brutality in that section of the book will give any reader a glipse of what war is."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I became hooked on Hemingway long ago when I was in college, and this is the book that got me hooked. In English composition we were being taught how to write interesting sentences, for instance, how many adjectives you could use in describing a person walking down the street. Then I read Hemingway and realized you could write, \"He walked down the street\", because walking wasn't the important thing. The important thing was what was in the heart of the person walking down the street. When Hemingway won the Nobel Prize the committee mentioned THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, but it would be hard to imagine Hemingway winning the Nobel Prize and becoming one of the three giants of twentieth century American literature without FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. I would recommend this book, but be careful, you just might get hooked on Hemingway."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It cracks me up how Hemingway refuses to write swear words and the word &quot;obscenity&quot; becomes a verb, ie. We are obscenitied!The obvious Spanish syntax is interesting as well and I imagine that those not fluent in Spanish would find the English both twisted and awkward at times.(example, Hemingway writes, &quot;For a favor, do this!, which seems a direct translation of &quot;Por favor&quot;.Another example is &quot;How many years to you have?&quot; (Cu&aacute;ntos a&ntilde;os tienes) instead of the proper English &quot;How old are you?&quot;.  It's as if Hemingway wrote the dialogue in Spanish and then translated it word for word into English. I'm not sure if this is genious or annoying.Regardless of this goofy English, the novel is a good read and I recommend reading it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I learned a very important lesson here; take a good peak at the book before you get it. The Scribner publication (paperback) of this Hemingway Novel wasn't the one I believe most people read. This was spattered everywhere with \"Thee\" and \"Thou.\" That really detracted from the story. Unfortunately I don't think even with out that distraction the story wouldn't have been much better. It also would have helped me had I known more about the bigger picture. I'm not that familiar with Spanish history and wasn't sure who represented what. Also a strange personal quirk; I keep thinking of the protagonist Robert Jordan, and transposing him in my mind with Di Vinci Code protagonist Robert Langdon. I guess it's the common name Robert."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Hemingway used his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War to build the structure for this novel.  His descriptions of the settings are superb. The novel is a great introduction to the Spanish Civil  War, a war with which many Americans are unfamiliar. Hemingway used  characters like Pablo to show how people lose their humanity during war.  The story is powerful.  His main character, Robert Jordan, begins to  question whether anything good will come of all the fighting.Despite its  many wonderful attributes, this novel has some problems.  The dialogue is  stilted.  The romance (as in all Hemingway novels) is unbelievable.  Finally, Hemingway should have stuck to English.  His use of Spanish in  this book is embarassing.Nonetheless, in my opinion, For Whom the Bell  Tolls should be required reading for all U.S. high school students.  It's  truly a classic."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read many, many books. I read many good books. But I read few books that are masterpieces and that I *know* are masterpieces before I've even finished them. This is one of them.Hemingway is a writer of many virtues and his share of faults. All his virtues and few of his faults are on display here. He brings to life a little skirmish in a &#34;little&#34; war that would perhaps be largely forgotten by most of the world were it not for this very book. His characterizations (with the exception of Maria, who however well she serves her purpose, is still, frankly insipid) are brilliant. Jordan is easily one of his most likable and relatable heroes, Pilar one of his best female characters. The conflict, and especially the climax in the last fifty pages, is electric.Thought-provoking, moving, entertaining - what more can you ask from a book?"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My first Hemingway was Men Without Women, a collection of short stories, and I was so bored with it. After that, I pretty much put Hemingway on my black list, because if I couldn't stand his short stories, there's no way I'll get through a whole novel. Man was I wrong. I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend. All I can say is wow! This book is truly beautiful; the characters, the scenes, and all the emotions that goes with it.The whole story takes place in 4 days. It's about a man who's on a mission to blow up a bridge and to do so he needs to work with the local guerrillas. Each character is unique, and the all the things one man can learn about life in just 4 days.Definitely one of my favorite books of all time. I look forward to checking out his other novels as well."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Hemingway's style was so fashionable amongst writers of the post WWII era, that Italian authors actually attempted to invent their own slang just to sound like him. I haven't kept up with modern Italian literature, but I am noting that American writing is slowly regressing into that pre-Hemingway over-wordiness.  The focus now seems to be on sounding &quot;poetic,&quot; rather than writing &quot;one true sentence.&quot;This is truly sad because Hemingway brought American writing to a new level. You can almost feel his straining to come up with the perfect words for his descriptions.I read For Whom the Bell Tolls for the first time thirty years ago, when I was fifteen.  It convinced me then that Ernest Hemingway was the greatest American writer of all time.  Re-reading it now, in middle age, I still feel the same."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "After having read the first half of this book, I was bored.  Nothing happened.  We heard about a future attack, but it never happened.  But then suddenly, at the last few chapters, it finally took place.  And then the book got so exciting that I sat there gasping for air.  I also understood why the boring first half was included, because that part was the one that made the last half in to such an incredible experience.  And after I read the whole book, the first half became exciting too. So buy this book, it is the best I have ever read.  But keep in mind, that the first half is boring.  So do not give up.  Keep reading it to the end, and I promise you the best reading experience you have ever had. It is the first book by Hemmingway I have read, but it will not be the last."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I feel bad giving a one star review on this because the paperback is printed very well and it looks very high class.... but this one is all Hemingway's fault. I LOVE classic books. I am an avid reader and I read books by Faulkner, Proust, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Victor Hugo in my free time. I was not assigned this and actually, if anything, I set out predisposed to like this book; that said, there were very few good things about this book. If you want to learn more about the Spanish civil war, this book might be for you - but if you care about characters, plot or writing style, this book is destined to disappoint. I can't believe I'm saying this about someone whose name is synonomous with a writer (eg. &#34;I'm no Hemingway but...&#34;), but this book was poorly written."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a tough book to write about. How many ways are there to say \"brilliant\"? This was a re-read for me of a war story and love story. The book far surpasses both. It was the first to describe war as it really is: with flawed heroes, horrible treatment of the civilian population by both sides, guerrillas who are both cruel and afraid, madmen in commanding positions, etc. It also tells about the Spanish Civil War, so for people are unaware that there actually was such a war, it is an eye-opener on the prelude to WWII. The book is appalling and beautiful at the same time. Please read it or re-read it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved Farewell to Arms, so I picked this up at the bookstore near work  and couldn't put it down.  It really grabbed me.  While the first chapter  in any Hemingway book is difficult due to his lack of immediate  characterization, it soon becomes easy to understand.  I loved the  dialogues between Pilar, Jordan, and Maria.  They were so funny.  I even  learned some Spanish.  I love Hemingway's prose and for a while I tried to  model my own writings after his.  Unfortunately, I'm not as good as he is  at it.  Anyway, this book has inspired me to go to Spain for my semester  abroad and to research the Spanish Civil War more deeply.  Great novel that  happens to be educational."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've probably read this book over 4 or 5 times throughout the years, first having read it as part of an assignment in a High School English class.  This is my absolute favorite book, and I'll tell you why.  As many reviewers have already pointed out, this book is enjoyable on so many levels: the characters are deep and complex; the questions about their purpose are deep.As a native Spanish speaker, I truly enjoy this book much more because Hemingway's prose is an exact translation of how the characters would speak in their Spanish setting, which I only realize now living in Puerto Rico and re-reading this masterpiece after many years (and two war tours).  The conversations, which may seem awkward to a non-Spanish speaker, are perfectly natural if translated into Spanish, adding to the realism of his tale.  Chalk this up to Hemingway's genius and his ability to create realistic worlds in which his characters live and die."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I revisited this book in my early 40's and came away resold on Hemingway as one of America's greatest writers and an artist who stands the test of time. It's a shame, in fact, that Hemingway's caricature-friendly persona, life and writing style have sometimes obsured his work. Forget the macho image and the stories of drinking and hunting. He is an artist of the first order.For Whom... is a novel about the important things -- life, love, death, fear, the attraction and horror of war. What struck me throughout was how innocent the characters are and how genuinely Hemingway depicts the most difficult subjects, be it war (in this case the Spanish Civil War) or the love between Maria and Robert Jordan.Hemingway is a writer we need in our times. He focuses on the big, important issues without cynicism, and never shies from exposing what is in our hearts and minds. A classic."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of several Hemingway books I have come to read, actually in this case, listen to.I loathe idling about so I decided while I wait, wherever that maybe, I would listen to an audiobook. I prefer the unabridged versions which in this case was quite long.I found the subject matter mysteriously complex ( who doesn't find love  complex ) yet simplistic in it's exposition true to Hemingway's style.Each character is carefully developed and his/her relationships meticulously crafted and consistent with their dispositions.Hemingway explores humanity and allows us a glimpse of it in the most trying circumstances....love and war.It really is very hard to discuss the book without ruining details and the outcome so I will stop here.I would suggest getting the audicopy on ipod and listening to it on your next long journey overseas."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story is a classic. It details events that occurred during the Spanish civil war of the late 1930s when fascism was on the rise in Western Europe.In 1944, in my adolescent romanticism, I had become immutably bonded to the characters and Ingrid Bergman after seeing the movie that had just come out.Now, 70 years later and reading the details of the love affair, I was to discover that I understood practically nothing of the historical significance in which the story takes place. The atmosphere of the guerrilla cave and escapades left a deep impression on me that was never to be forgotten.Should you read this novel, I might suggest that seeing the movie first might place the characters most strongly in their rightful desperate and fateful surroundings as so skillfully described by the author."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Hemingway is one of the best known authors worldwide and with good reason. As someone with limited knowledge of European history and a complete ignorance of the events of the Spanish Civil War, this had me engrossed and wanting to learn more. It had me so engrossed that I nearly wanted to go join a rebel movement and dedicate myself to war a la Robert Jordan.This book has the vital ingredients of sex and war and mixed together with Hemingway's unbelievably creative writing style, makes for one of the best works of fiction of all time."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Hemingway has a way of getting into our heads.  The characters are plain spoken; almost Shakespearean at times; with  powerful, philosophical paragraphs sprayed in.  His interest in bullfighting is obvious if you have read any of his work; and is not ignored here.  Against the rules of writing he uses the Spanish tongue; although irritating, he gets away with it.Set in the mid 1930's, and centered around an American munitions expert fighting to help the cause of removing the Germans, Italians, and the rest of the fascist armies from out of Spain.  He links up with a group of cave dwelling partisans outside of town.  Much of the book is spent on his relationship with this group and him falling in love with a young girl, whom he can never have.Some may object to the ending, but I found it fitting; \"I man's gota' do, what I man's gota' do\"Wish you wellScott"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Having recently come back from Paris, I went through a Hemingway phase, starting with his memoirs of his Paris days, then I stumbled on this book.The stumbling was a fortunate accident, for this book is amazing.  Hemingway's short but powerful prose is in perfect form. I actually find  Hemingway and Gabriel Garcia Marquez similar in their ability to capture a  thought completely in one sentence- even though their actual sentences are  different.Hemingway perfectly captures poignant emotions, and the  sentence sparsity adds to the strength and description beautifully.I  also agree with one of the other reviewers above, in that my appreciation  is probably helped by age. A lot of the emotions of loss, doubt,  disillusion and love I only felt in my post high school years. It's a good  adventure story nonetheless, but might lose its power for a youger  audience."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is another masterly work from Hemingway. When he gets it right, he gets it OH so right. You have more tight, evocative language that conjure up the landscapes the characters live in, and wonderful characterisation so that you fully engage and sympathise with them. This is a great look at the Spanish civil war from the guerrillas point of view, with the assistance of an American explosives expert. It has romance, chivalry, betrayal, adventure and the rougher side of human nature. What more could you want from one novel? If you like Hemingway then this is another great novel and if you're new to him, this may not be the best starting place, but you'll still not be disappointed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had to write this review because of the review someone else wrote...This person said it was about Hemingway's support for anti-communists and young americans going over to Spain during the civil war to fight the communists...He must not have read the book.  The main character of the book went to fight against the FASCISTS, not the communists.  He hated fascism and wanted to stop the fascist regime from taking Spain.  Fighting on his side were many communists, or Spanish backed by communist nations, such as the spanish generals trained by the communist Russian nation, so how on earth this reviewer could think it was against communism if he read the book is beyond me.  Also, this book is about much more, it explores moral issues and covers themes from love to the truth of war.  Hemingway really makes you see the tragedy and pointlessness of war."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "EXCERPTED FROM &quot;GOD'S COUNTRY&quot; BY STEVEN TRAVERS&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is based upon Hemingway?s support for the anti-Communists fighting in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s. He and many other Americans went over to fight in the war, which some say was a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for World War II. It did not materialize into the kind of idealized Spanish government that many had sacrificed for. The fascistic Francisco Franco ended up ruling an isolationist Spain until the 1970s. While the nation is now Democratic, the Franco regime was the final event that took Spain from greatness to mediocrity. Hemingway also wrote a stageplay about the Spanish Civil War called &quot;The Fifth Column&quot;.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;&lt;B>..."}

I really enjoyed the ugly women who had in her life many young handsome swashbuckling lovers who were matadors. This reminds me of advice I have given to women many times in my life essentially if you are a women and you like a guy pursue him it's really a buyers market for women when it comes to men in that respect."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Ernest Hemingway wrote another great adventure story with FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. His style is very vivid, and reading the book is like being on the scene of the Spanish Civil War itself. Prior to reading FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, I had read all his short stories while taking a short story course in college, then THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA. The short stories vary in style, except that they are also written in short sentences, just as Hemingway preferred. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA tends to be boring, but FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is fascinating throughout. I just wish I had the time to read more of Hemingway's novels, just to see what they are like."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "in for whom the bell tolls hemingway looks at war from the individuals perspective. his army is a rag tag group of guerrilla fighters, not the army. the time and setting is the spanish civil war. a general understanding of that war is helpful. the characters include mostly local insurgents and one american mercenary. the horrors of war are portrayed on both sides with neither having the higher moral ground.it is also a study of courage in the face of potential death. this is developed not only through the underlying theme of war, but the stories of some of the characters earlier lives which include bull fighting and the running of the bulls.the one drawback to the book is the stilted language used in the dialog of the novel (including the refusal to use obscenities).a book well worth the read"}

I seldom remember lines from books, but I've memorized many from this novel.  The opening quote from John Donne is  as deep as they come.  It sets the tone for the book, but is better  understood if you immediately re-read the quote right after finishing the  book.  You really truly understand then what is meant when he says,  &quot;Do not send to know for whom the bell tolls....it tolls for  thee.&quot;"}

For years I read the poem at the beginning of the book, (which has the same title as the book itself) but had never read the content.  It is amazing that after years of reflecting on that poem, that reading the actual content of this classic meant so much more. As I am sure was Hemingway's intention, you can literraly reflect on that poem back through every single chapter in the book, and each time the poem will have a new meaning for the reader.  This is a true sign, in my opinion, of a great author.  I need to read this novel again, to pick up on some of the hidden inuendos and nuances I might have missed the first time, but that too will be time well-spent.This is a phenomenal book, by a bona fide, talented classic author.

Even if you are not looking to learn about chimpanzee developement and behavior, the book is excellent on a purely entertainment level.

{"label": 5, "raw": "A really fine volume. Jane Goodall describes her study of chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream in Tanzania. She and her team has studied these animals over a long period of time. This covers the social behavior of the chimpanzees in the earlier years of the study.The story occurs at several levels. One, simply, is the interaction of individuals with their own personalities--Flo, David, Goliath, Faben, Merlin, Passion, and so on. Another level is the group/society. What is the structure of the society studies?The book covers the life cycle of chimpanzees in this environment-- from infant on. It explores relations with other species. It looks at the variety of behaviors that characterize chimpanzee society--reproduction, feeding, hierarchy, predation, and so on. The book also addresses the challenges facing chimpanzees as humans encroach further.In the end, a riveting book, well worth reading."}

She gives excellent descriptions of how chimpanzees interact as family members, how they feel like people do - and what people can learn from them. Her book makes us readers aware of how close animals can come to how human beings feel and act, and that man is by no means far superior to animals. It also gives us an incentive to appreciate animals and to respect them. Obviously, Jane Goodall observes and then accurately narrates. Even in the shadow of man, animals develop healthy, and man needs to respect that."}

She was so far ahead of her time, science is now only beginning to catch up. This is a beautifully written account of the beginnings of the longest continuous animal field study on earth. The discoveries Jane Goodall made at Gombe, in Tanzania, redefined not only science's understanding of Chimpanzees, but also redefined human beings. Because of Jane Goodall, we could no longer consider man to be the only \"tool maker\" living on earth.In the Shadow of Man has all the elements of a best-seller - politics, violence, sex, warfare, murder, devotion, tenderness, even love."}

Dalrymple and his wife go to spend a year living in Delhi (how did they afford this?), and he uses this arrangement as a way of chronicling the present day status of the city  and delving deep into its history. He's done a very nice job of moving back  and forth between present and past, managing to keep all his meetings and  interviews with various experts quite interesting. The only part which lost  my interest was an extended look into Sufi mysticism, but I just skimmed it  and moved along. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in India,  and especially to anyone planning a trip to Delhi."}

He took me places that I wouldn't have been able to visit even if I flew to Delhi today.The people he met and described were as fascinating as the places he explored. This book is a combination of history, tourism, mini-biography, human interest, archeology and anthropology. The mix was well balanced and Dalrymple's writing ability made the entire book entertaining as well as educational.Please do not let the age of this book dissuade you from reading it. Dalrymple's take on Delhi will still be worth the read for as long as people read.My only gripe (worth a tenth of a star) was with the only map. Though nicely drawn by his wife, it was nearly useless. A more inclusive map would have added a tremendous amount to my enjoyment."}

She will love it as much as I do, I predict. The layers of the city are peeled back through Dalrymple's sensitive approach to history and culture, and the reader is transported to places and times that are long gone, as well as those that are contemporary. Walking through the streets of New Delhi and Old, the reader feels as though the City has come alive in some other dimension. Voices speak from the past, and some of those voices have lessons to share."}

{"label": 5, "raw": "Overall, an excellent overview of anarchism that is well worth reading. Glad I bought it and enjoyed reading it.However, at times the author goes from chronicling the views of individual anarchists (and opponents) to coming down on one side or another of a debate. This itself would be useful, except the author seems to give short shrift to views he doesn't share.For example, take Murray Bookchin's criticisms of deep ecology. Marshall simply treats Bookchin's criticisms as untenable and treats Bookchin's disagreements with the deep ecologists as an example of how Bookchin \"laments our alienation from nature ... but he would still appear to be a victim of the process.\"Perhaps if the subtitle of \"Demanding the Impossible\" had been \"An Evaluation and Critique of Anarchism\" rather than \"A History of Anarchism\" this wouldn't have been so jarring, but it left me wondering (as someone not overly familiar with anarchist thinking and debates) how much of his history is colored by his own personal views on what is and is not anarchism proper."}

It's comprehensive, objective, well sourced and indexed, and frequently updated.

It's particularly adept at showing the precursors of anarchism as well as anarchism's close philosophical relatives. All the internal and external controversies and criticisms regarding anarchism are covered as well as anarchism's replies. The book covers the history of anarchism in action and in thought. Although the book is a daunting 705 pages printed in a font a tad too small for aging eyes, the book is a page turner. With an admirable scrupulousness, Marshall largely doesn't interject his affiliations until the very end in the epilogue and, even then, he does so minimally.This will be a book that I consult frequently. I cannot recommend it highly enough."}

The Allies who prosecuted the Pacific War held trials of Japan's war leaders on the same legal basis as those of the Nazis following the end of WWII. This book, written by a reporter who was present during the proceedings, looks at international law and the violations of it while Japan attempted to take over Asia. Also, the Japanese government's involvment in narcotics trafficing and both large-scale and small-scale atrocities directed at the civilian populations and POWs was addressed during the trials.While imperfect, the trials not only established the criminal behavior of Japan's government but determined the punishment of key leaders involved. The war guilt of Emperor Hirohito was never addressed (or addressed only obliquely) for political reasons while seven men were hanged for war crimes.A good read with some photos."}

Over time, the wooden shafted golf clubs gave way to titanium steel.I certainly enjoyed the historical perspective that the book provided. Although some golf instruction is included in the book, it is more of a nostalgic look backwards to days spent in the Texas sun mowing the lawns and watering the greens. Reading a book like this is not a bad way to spend an afternoon. Harvey Penick had a good life.If you are searching for a serious golf instruction manual, however, you may want to choose another book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book many years ago, when I was 13. At the time I was into much younger books for younger readers, but my college aged sister introduced me to this one - and I was totally hooked. A love of historical fiction and gothic romance followed, and I read all of Victoria Holt's novels. There was no end in sight after that, and today, 27 years later, I often wonder where I would be without Victoria Holt. I recommend this book to all young adults. It will introduce you to a whole new world, one of reading."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book actually should be under one of Victoria Holt's other pen names, Jean Plaidy.  Plaidy writes about actual historical figures.The Queen's Confession is told by Marie Antoinette herself.  Well, not actually, but how she would have written it.  She grows up in the Austrian court under the guidance of her mother, the Empress Maria Therese.  She marries the Dauphin of France and deals with the &quot;uncrowned queen&quot;, Madame du Barry.  Finally, she becomes queen and started the beginning of the end of the French monarchy.  Scandal, intrigue, and flamboyancy were never as great, and the consequences are even greater.This book was wonderful!  I actually learned a lot about her (I thought I knew everything!).  Also, it is a good book to read if you are in for a good cry."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Ahhh Marie Antoinette. By now most people know she really did not utter the phrase \"let them eat cake\" in response to the raising bread shortage. During her and her husband's reign, the country was very unstable. There was a famine, a huge deficit, and finally, the Bastille and Reign of Terror.The book begins with her at 14, and just about to be married to the Dauphin of France. With get a look at what it must have been like to be her, a child bride, and completely unaware of what is in store for her. the famous line when they became the reigning king and queen\" we are too young to govern\" was probably true.We see her slowly mature and see through her eyes the country falling apart. What noone realized at the time was it really wasn't all her doing.Written as though she herself wrote it while awaiting exeuction, we feel sorry for her and that is truly the mark of a great book and a great writer."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "From the dust jacket: ...Red Adam's Lady is a boisterous, bawdy tale of wild adventure, set against the constant dangers of medieval England. It is a story of civil war and border raids, scheming aristocrats and brawling villagers, daring escapes...Its vivid details give the reader a fascinating and realistic view of life in a medieval castle and village...The reviews here are excellent. There are times when I cringe at the brutality of an era but the writing here is so fast-paced I found I didn't have time. It's a wild ride and highly enjoyable."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It seems cruel to review this book because you can't get it anymore.  My old copy is held together with rubber bands.  I liked everything about it.  All the characters were wonderful; the history was accurate; the mystery and intrigue were mysterious and intriguing.  The secondary characters were almost better than the main characters.  Good wasn't always pretty and Evil was evil with reasons and, sometimes, even strengths.  You could hiss the villians and cheer the good guys but you knew that these people lived and you mourned and rejoiced with them.  When the hero finally wins his lady's love, it's a timeless moment. Her love is an achievement...not a casual tumble in the normal historical bodice ripper.  My only complaint about this book was it was too short and there's never been a sequel.  If you can find a copy, read it - you'll love it."}

To me,  reading this story was like stepping back in time - into a romantic and  charming and exciting time... I really wish the publisher would re print  this book!  I would love to have my daughters read it now."}

On their way out of England, they &quot;accidentally&quot; stop by Whiteladies, and old castle inhabited by a young lady, Minta (isn't that at pretty name?), her parents, and her governess.  From there, they go to Australia.  Once there, Nora meets Lynx, seemingly half-man, half-god.

I found myself wanting to strangle Uncle Aaron and to scream at Natalie. I think knowing what's in store for the various characters just built up the tension.My husband is a WWII junkie and so I have seen every episode of every documentary ever made about that war. But I learned more about the causes of the war and the thinking of the politicians from this one novel than from any of the documentaries.  If you are even vaguely interested in that war, read this.  Not just history, but a great story"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The story takes us and the Henry Family from 1939 to 1941.  We see how the coming war changes members of the Henry family and their friends.  We meet some of the important people who shaped the world and led us into War.  We participate in the invasion of Poland and learn who the war changed the lives of those who were involved.  Some characters face terrible challenges and rise to the occasion and others fail.  Hitler was not a nice person.  Read the book and watch the miniseries.  It was interesting to see the attitudes of many Americans before the war and others in Europe how they thought things were going."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this in hard-copy when it was first published.  During several moves, I have lost the book.  I decided to get the Kindle edition and I am thrilled to read this wonderful author again.  I found the sequel 'War and Remembrance' in the last move and will read that.  This is a long novel but well worth the time.  Although fiction, it involved historical figures that give it a real-life experience quality.  The fictional characters are fully developed and it is easy to visualize their life during the run up to World War II.  It is definitely a cautionary tale in today's world where most of us have the tendency to bury our heads in sand--or in family and work--and hope things will get better without doing anything ourselves.  Great read.  I'm still on the second half (because this is really two volumes) and even knowing the end, I'm rooting for Natalie and Aaron to get back home."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you were one of those students that was doodling during American History or, more likely, by spring when WWII was covered, was thinking of other things as the teacher sped through the entire event in two periods, this is an wonderfully enjoyable way to get the history you missed. Following two families, this historic fiction offers insights into WWII that no textbook could. It opens in early 1939 and closes with Pearl Harbor, describing events in London, Europe, Washington and the Pacific. The book includes an enormous amount of factual data on actual events and individuals who played a significant role during the period. Additionally, it very effectively employs the device of reports written by a fictitious German general, to provide the German perspective on the war effort there. All in all an excellent book that should be required reading for anyone that feels they know too little about the period. And the sequel, War and Remembrance (which I am now reading) is an excellent follow up, continuing to track the characters throughout the remainder of the war."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Herman Wouk's tale is a huge masterpiece: sweeping in terms of plot, character, and history. His knowledge of WWII is staggering; years of research are evident in the story. He also has the rare gift of literary poetry, with imaginative similes rolling off the storyteller's pen. The one very slight fault is that the occasional letters or diaries lose a bit of their authentic voice; most people, even creative geniuses, don't pen such cleverly Shakespearian notes to their loved ones. Otherwise, this is a moving and satisfying drama about one of the globe's great tragic conflicts. NOTE: I read a hard copy, not the much-aligned Kindle version."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The &#34;Winds of War' along with its sequel &#34;War and Remembrance&#34; have been around for a long time. Still probably no other piece of historical fiction better tells the inside thinking and decision making of WWII's major players.  Told through the eyes of an extraordinary Naval Attache, &#34;Pug&#34; Henry finds himself with the wars key decision makers during their most important decisions of  WWII.The novel is also about the plight of the Jews in Europe leading up to and throughout WWII told through the eyes of Natalie Jastrow and her stubborn Uncle Aarron, the novel shows just how easily the Jews of Europe were systematically gathered up and brought to the &#34;work camps&#34; where most were eventually gassed.The novel(s) are both beautifully and horrifically written.  Some of the finest historical fiction ever written,"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "\"The Winds of War\" and \"War and Remembrance\" must be read together. These lengthy novels follow the trials and travails of one American family through the years immediately preceeding the Second World War through to the end of that war. The author does a great job of depicting the terrors of the holocaust and of the ground war on Europe's eastern front. Likewise pacific naval combat is dealt with on a personal level. The historical context of the books seemed to be quite accurate. By the close of the second book the reader will have an appreciation for the cost of global war. Personally, I could have done with somewhat less of the romantic double-dealings and intrigue. My only other caution to the prospective reader is the daunting length of these books. I listened to the unabridged Audible Audio version of both books and found the narration to be excellent."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book, and it's companion, \"War and Remembrance\" are two of my favorite novels of WWII. I read/re-read them about every ten years. I find them exceptionally well written with clearly drawn characters who enter the traumic period of Western civilization's march through the use of the industrial model for the destruction of millions of people and an end to traditional European colonial powers. I find myself caring about the characters, their losses, and how they delt with a world bent on destruction; characters trying to balance traditional values while creating new beginnings from the ashes of a world focused on self-destruction and death. I have read most of Mr. Wouk's books and have been a fan of his writings for many years. You will not be disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "He's a most utterly unappealing protagonist.  Wouk wants us to think of Pug as a career-driven, very rigidly moral sort of person.  Instead, he came across to me as cold, humorless, stodgy, somewhat hypocritical, and very, VERY boring.  The few things Wouk has him do to make him less of a plaster saint (drinks a bit, smokes, lusts in his heart after a young English woman) didn't humanize Pug for me.  By the end of the novel, I found him about as likeable as Wouk's other famous character, Captain Queeg.That said, the plot of the novel was engrossing and most of the other characters (Including Hitler and Stalin!)were more interesting and entertaining than Pug.The definite highlight of the book is Wouk writing as the German General van Roon.  It's very convincingly done and it is in these sections of the book where what little (sly) humor Wouk offers is to be found."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For me,  THE WINDS OF WAR, combined with WAR AND REMEMBRANCE, comprise Herman Wouk's ultimate masterpiece. A sweeping telling of the World War II story from initial rumblings to Hiroshima, all through the eyes of a US Navy commander. The two books combined make for a massive read, but it's well worth it.  We must never ever forget the horror of the war, the horrific fate of the Jews caught in it's net and the brave men who willingly and, yes, gladly went off to fight enemies on both sides of the planet.  They are dying daily and the world owes them a huge debt.  Herman Wouk's accurate and fair telling of the story will stand as a monument to all of them. These books can be read and read again then listened to in the excellent audio version - they are that good."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I feel like I stepped into the 1940's and I was right ther with Pug and Rhoda. This is the most detailed and accurate novel on WWII that I have read.The charachers are so alive. This Navy family are scattered all over Europe and the US in WWII. You go from desk jobs to the trenches in Russia. Briney the youngest son marries a Jewish woman who is living in Siena, Italy so you can guess where that leads.You read the horrors of Hitlers Final Solution. All the military planning and battles and the tender moments between husbands and wives.The Kindle edition did have many typo's in it. I did report it and was assured that it is being corrected.This is a great read and it is so much easier to read on the Kindle as it is a BIG heavy book.I highly recommend it to anyone who loves WWII drama."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Despite the fictional characters, I believe this book to be among the best sources available to get a sense of the world of the 1940's.  As a baby boomer, I grew up among many adults who were directly or indirectly involved in World War II.  Herman Wouk has captured the values and views of that generation in a way that no future novelist (one who was not an eyewitness to those times) will ever be able to do.  The Henry family whose lives are traced through this book typify the straightforward Americans of that day.  This book ought to have won a Pulitzer.  Oh and finally, in case none of the other 37 reviewers mentioned it, for inquiring minds:  &quot;Wouk&quot; rhymes with &quot;oak&quot;."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "\"The Winds of War\" by Herman Wouk was one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  I have just ordered \"War and Remembrance\" because I finished the latter today and need to continue with the story.  The first half of the story (the first book) was a bit slow at first and I was reluctant to continue on, however it soon picked up pace and I couldn't put it down.  The story was heart-rending and I became sympathetic to all of the main characters and felt disdain towards the antagonists, just as the protagonists felt. I recommend this book to anyone who loves America and the struggle to gain freedom in a time when hope seemed far in the distance.  This book will enliven the American spirit.  I am sure that \"War and Remembrance\" will be just as well-written as \"The Winds of War\" and I look forward to reading how the character's lives end up.  Read This!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved the mini-series so decided to give the book a go.  The TV series covered all the most important things from the book, but as usual there is much detail in the book that there was not time for in the series. This book is a good bet for  anyone who loves an engrossing story about a very important time in the history of mankind.  I learned a great deal that I never knew before, and I fancy myself somewhat of a history buff.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A reader does not need to have a special interest in war stories to enjoy this novel (along with its continuation in War and Remembrance).  This is a very well-written story that puts a personal face on World War Two.  Even though The Winds of War adn War and Remembrance is one coherent stroy covering over 2000 pages, the story never bogs down.  Spans events from the lead-up to the end of the war and follows the main characters all over the world.  Wouk does a great job of writing from various perspectives.The history seems to be fairly accurate, with some necessary literary license taken to covey the sheer volume of information required as the backdrop for the main characters.  You wouldn't read this to replace history works, but it really humanizes the events of the war."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This Book on CD's is terribly disappointing. The CD's don't play well in my car CD player - the player either skips ahead to future tracks or skips back to previous tracks or even occassionally to another CD. In addition, the CD's are packaged so poorly that the plastic binders that hold the folders for the discs come apart readily when you try to turn to unplayed CD's or when you try to put back CD's and have now ripped out of the base on the container. The product seems like a counterfeit product produced in a back alley in Bejing or Hanoi with poor, cheap materials. Extremely disappointing!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Wouk's The Winds of War is a wonderful piece of historical fiction.  Following the Henry family in their international travels in the lead up to World War II, the author's extensive research enables him to use this familial narrative as a context for providing the reader with a history of the events that lead up to the break out of WW II.  The characters are unpredictable and realistically three-dimensional.  The book was so good, I eagerly took up its sequel War and Remembrance the moment I finished it.  Highly recommended."}

Navy Captain Victor \"Pug\" Henry travels the world doing odd jobs for FDR while Germany invades Poland, overruns France, and fights England and Russia.  In the meantime, FDR keeps the USA out of the war. After rubbing elbows with Churchill, Stalin, and Hitler, Pug finally finishes up his tasks for FDR and heads to Hawaii to command a battleship.  All Pug really ever wanted was a sea command, a decent shot at flag rank, and good lives for his family.  Wait a minute---Hawaii?  Isn't that where Pearl Harbor is?  When I read \"The Caine Mutiny\", I thought I had read Wouk's best.  Despite the rather narrower scope of \"Caine\", I still feel that way. Don't miss this one though, it's great."}

As the other reviewer said, there is a little \"they know we know that they know\" business in this book, but that didn't stop me from zipping through this book in about 2 days. I  give this book 5 stars because the style of writing just allows you to literally sprint through the pages without realizing you're even reading. it's seamless, and a breeze to read. i never once stopped to question something he wrote, and never once felt like i was \"outside of the story\". i'll be purchasing more of his books pronto."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I think James Bond should take a leaf from Alistair Maclean's books. His hero in this &quot;yarn&quot; defies description, someone who is smart, a little cynical, unwilling to give in to the momentary distractions of injury or beautiful spoiled women (who are actually great heroines in disguise!) in order to force the hand of the blackguard holding the world in thrall.  My most memorable scene in this book is when the protagonist is suffering from a bullet-ridden leg, yet hanging from the side of a porthole in high wind, trying valiantly to get past the villains that have hijacked this ship which has precious lives and gold cargo.  It's a real treat and an engrossing read, especially because it is so fantastic!  I would rather take a hero of Maclean's stamp than Ian Fleming's any day of the week!"}

The author manages to make day-to-day - in fact a minute to minute - life aboard a Napoleon-era man-of-war seem like it is happening contemporaneously. And a very exciting life it is too. Aubrey's skill as a mariner is amply displayed, as are the machinations of .Maturin. I used to think the C.S.Forester's Hornblower was the ultimate in sea stories of that era, but his skill has been supplanted, in my view, by O'Brien. If you like sea stories you will love this one."}

More importantly, he continues his tradition of compelling characters in involving situations. I wasn't thrilled with the way poor Jack kept getting slammed with defeat after defeat, though. In addition, although thoroughly enjoyable and even re-readable, this book lacked the \"oomph\" that would have let me give it a 5 rating. Like all the books in this series, the conversion to e-text was done via OCR and not as carefully as I would have preferred. but the result is readable."}

Eric Johnson, I have to say, has a very different personality, melodic approach, and technique from Vai and Satriani, but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better."}

I don't like his overexaggerated singing much, he seems to try to somewhat copy Marc Bolan (personal opinion) and as for craftsmanship on the instrument he seems adequate at best. The other guys look bored and i got the impression the only time they enjoyed themselves was during the heavier songs like 'kick out the jams'. The only song i liked was the last one 'hallelujah' but even that dragged out too much. A redeeming factor was that i aquired the DVD for a bargain and got almost all my money back when i traded it in at a different shop."}

However I found the constant darkness overwhelming, even though the light background showing the city was very well done. Similarly almost all costumes were black, as if everyone, no matter what was happening, was dressed for a funeral, even those celebrating the wedding between Zerlina and Masetto. Although that is not their fault, Donna Anna, Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira appeared too old to make their passionate roles believable. The parts of Leporello and Don Giovanni were acted excellently: Leporello a servant, ambivalent, who enjoys, but then also dislikes his role; Don Giovanni: a very charming seducer, who can also be cruel, who does not care at all about the effect of his actions on others."}

Watching the little kids play with the babies is my favorite part, and it really gets my daughter's attention.  All in all I do recommend this DVD.  It shows alot, but isn't too fast paced.

Riverdance is exhilarating entertainment that lifts you up and leaves you with simple joy in life itself.I can't think of anything we need more given the events of the past month.Peace."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Our 4-year old enjoyed it, with a little explanation in order about Miss Clavel's habit, and about the motives of the kidnappers.A very nice extra on the DVD is an old 1952 animated short based closely on the original Bemelmans book, with the text and cartoon style nearly identical. Amusingly, Miss Clavel is therein depicted as a sort of governess, rather than as a nun; perhaps a sign of the times, or maybe the cartoon's producers were not Catholic?I thought Hatty Jones did great in the title role -- wonder what ever happened to her?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was hoping this would be a decent video about potty training.  It jumps around too much from character to character and from process to process.  Addresses washing hands before it addresses using the potty which it called a toilet and let's face it few kids / parents call it a toilet so that is another thing that irritated me.  I have always hated that shadow chick, and she is really annoying in this series.  And the \"potty time\" song with silloute stick figures is just plain stupid.  There was only one redeeming scene in the actual bathroom with the little brown bear, but the rest of this was total [...].  It is going in the next yard sale."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this dvd for my 24month old son. I've been potty training him since he was 18m with great success but he had a backslide, having accidents about 4x a week. Now, he grabs himself and says POTTY and runs to the bathroom. Before he was using a potty chair, now he only uses the toilet (I think because he saw Tutter using the toilet). Aside from the potty training he loves the singing and he loves all of the animals on the show. I also recommend Bear in the Big Blue House: Colors and Shapes. These dvd's are so cute my little one watches them every day!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "My daughter loves Bear, and especially Tutter. So when we saw this video we though this would be a great way to introduce potty training to her.She watched the video a couple of times, but it did not interest her. She always seemed to be distracted. I like the idea that the video shows kids that this is a normal everyday thing.While this video has not been the perfect tool for us, I would not discourage others from buying it. We have found our daughter prefers to read and that she enjoys reading the book \"Potty Time\" while sitting on her potty."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you haven't heard any of Carole's music since Tapestry, hold on to your hat.  Her style has evolved, but not unrecognizably so.  And her wonderful voice and talent are the same.The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio quality is quite good.  The visual quality is high  enough to watch at a widescreen setting with only a tiny loss of sharpness.  Each song is a chapter, so you can easily go to a particular song.  My  only criticism is that the dvd is very dark in places.  I would have preferred softer lighting  on the stage with fewer spotlights and shadows.I loved seeing Carole at the piano for several songs during this concert. That's  the Carole that I remember.  But how fun it is to see Carole facing the audience, singing, dancing, and inviting them to join in on a chorus of one of the old  favorites.  This is a must-see for any Carole King fan."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "I was shocked to see Tchaikovsky's classic danced exclusively by males.  One reviewer felt that the result was a \"human\"-- not merely  \"romantic\"-- ballet.  I saw it as a travesty of Swan Lake.  We all know that gays have contributed much to ballet, but Nureyev danced with Fonteyn in the pas de deux from Le Corsaire.  A gay agenda should not trump artistic integrity.  The superb pas de deux by Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky in the other selection from Swan Lake did not remove the bad taste left by Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Puccini's La Fanciulla Del West must have a great cast, in order to bring out the depth of characterizations and musical values, as prescribed by Puccini and his librettist. Placido Domingo and Carol Neblett shine in this production from the Royal Opera. The rest of the cast are all well- suited to their roles. Maestro Santi has a reputation for being a formidable Italian conductor! The production is great. I'm spoiled by today's High-Definition format, so my only reservation is the picture quality. This production is from a number of years ago. All in all,this is a good product and should be in any operaficionado's collection!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Girl of the Golden West is almost funny in its use of a Western (as in USA) as an operatic vehicle.  The real strength of this production is that looks like a western and the men and Minnie, the important female, look like characters from a western. The sets are excellent.  The acting was also good.  However with the exception of the male lead, Ramirez (alias Dick Johnson), played by Placido Domingo, the singing is extremely wobbly and, in the case of Minnie, the singing was so inaccurate that I could not even imagine what the musical intent was.La Fanciulla. . . is a good opera that anyone could enjoy.  You should not buy this version when an musically excellent La Scala production is available on both DVD and VHS."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Handel, when asked towards the end of his life what he thought his greatest work was, replied \"Theodora\". It's his next-to-last oratorio, and it is of such transcendant beauty that words fail to describe it. Everything that can be said about this performance has already been said better by others, so I won't even try. Peter Sellar's direction may not be to everyone's taste, but he had the vision to turn this English \"Oratorio\" into a viable stage piece, crucially giving Lorraine Hunt the opportunity to give her greatest dramatic performance. She's the star of this show, even if everyone else surpasses themselves as well. A sublime, overwhelming recording of Handel's greatest work. Not to be missed."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a far better interpretation than the older Bolshoi performance that was recorded in the 1970s on murky Russian film stock.  The choreography and dancing in that version were dull to say the very least - cinematography and editing uninspired and choppy, respectively. It was also half an hour shorter than this performance.This newer version with the Australian Ballet is superbly choreographed and strongly danced.  It is perhaps the most virile ballet performance every captured on film or videotape. This is a videotaped performance and is overwhelmingly powerful and passionate.  The male dancers are all quite strikingly handsome and every movement is devoid of the \"elegance\" and effeminacy in the earlier Bolshoi performance.  This is rugged, but in its sheer masculinity, it is a tribute to the beauty of the male body in movement.This screams to be converted to DVD before the VHS goes out of print."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was my first time seeing anying by the Australian Ballet and I was very impressed.  Costumes and sets are beautiful.  Pavane and Horsman are very talented performers.  I really enjoyed the second act in the Dr's \"workroom\".  The members of the company who \"dance\" the various \"dolls\" are great especially the one who performs the floppy, unformed, unsculpted \"doll\".  Also worth noting is that a friend who knows nothing about ballet easily understood the story without help from me or any other source."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Coppelia has always been my favorite ballet (to watch and to dance).My friend and I decided that we wanted to see the ballet again, after several years of not seeing it, so I went on Amazon to see what was out there.  I'm really glad that I chose the Australian Ballet's version.If you read the other reviews, yes, there are some differences from the 'classic' version of the story, but it's done really well and the dancing is phenomenal.  If you're looking for a great version of this ballet for your collection, pick this one up, you won't be disappointed.(this, from a professional ballet dancer. Well, 2 if you count the friend I watched it with!)  :-)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Peter Lorre is the psychopathic child murderer who turns a whole German city upside down trying to track him down. The underworld gets in on the chase after the police, in doing their job so thoroughly, harass them so much they can't conduct business as usual (pretty funny when you think about it). Thus we have a race between the cops and the crooks to see who'll find Lorre first. The crooks win after getting a tip from a blind balloon seller (the blind leading the blind?).Any other director might have been satisfied with this ironic satire, but Fritz Lang goes after more: Lorre is what really interests him, the workings of a psychotic killer, the uncontrollable drives, the fear, the guilt. And Lorre, sweating profusely, eyes bulging, makes us feel what it must be like to be trapped in who he is. That is what makes this film so memorable. A great movie. Definitely worth a watch."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Honestly, after reading some of the wonderfully written reviews here I cannot see myself even attempting to better this excellence.  Just going to say I watched it today and was astounded.  I originally started to watch it in English but as soon as Lorre came on, realized he didn't do his own voice-over. Stopped and begin the subtitled version. The imagery in this film will blow you away. Lorre is perfect in the part.  I've mostly seen him in comedic roles, the exception being CASSABLANCA, so this was a good opportunity to watch him strut his dramatic chops.On a lesser note, I enoyed seeing life in the 30's Germany. The washboard and the wash tub, the way the rooms looked as well as the way people dressed.Now, go read some of the other reviews. You won't be sorry."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Peter Lorre is great  as the man who kills children.  M is an excellent film.  A man is killing children and the police are going after everybody with a record, so the criminals band together to find the killer to get the police off their backs. How these desperate characters work together makes a very compelling and suspenseful story.  Directed by Fritz Lang, who also directed the Sifi masterpiece metropolis, does a great job on his first talkie. Shortly after making this film Peter Lorre fled Germany and Fritz Lang followed shortly there after as both men were Jews.  I would highly recommend this movie.  It is in German with English subtitles, and after a while you don't mind reading them."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is what every filmmaker should try to produce.This film is difficult to rival.  It was and still is an influential movie that discussed reality with realism and never shied away from continual controversy.  One of the first films about a serial killer, with details ripped from the headlines and extras ripped from the streets.Peter Lorre is a genius in this film.  Even though you know everything, he still manages to illicit some sympathy from viewers.  Lang is excellent at creating a story that draws in his audience and captivates.This movie also solidified Edvard Grieg's \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" as a terrifying piece of music.Although made in 1931, this film looks and feels well beyond its time.  This new edition of this film will ensure its legacy to continue well beyond as a masterpiece!Highly recommend for anyone, especially those who consider themselves cinema connoisseurs."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "German director Fritz Lang's first sound film was this haunting story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre) on the loose in a large German city.  It is a seminal film in the sense that it ranks among the first appearances of two genres: police procedurals and serial killer movies.  Lang's Berlin is an eerie place full of shadows and inhabited by a very well-organized underworld that is capable of launching its own manhunt for the killer when the police investigation makes things too uncomfortable.  Lorre's Hans Beckert is a pathetic figure that acts on his grotesque compulsions in total ignorance of the forces aligning against him.  His tormented speech toward the end of the film, when he has been put on trial before the mass of the Berlin underworld, shows keen insight into the killer's condition and mental state, almost eliciting sympathy for him.  This is a stark, facinating film."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "\"M\" was a pioneering effort when Fritz Lang directed it, a lifetime ago, and it's still well worth watching. But 72 years later, it's lost a bit of its edge. Peter Lorre was primarily a stage actor at the time he appeared in \"M\" and by today's standards  his performance in the famous \"underground trial\" scene verges on scenery-chewing. And while the print used to produce Criterion Collection DVD is mostly clear, the subtitles [are bad] ... sentences are broken in odd places, and often several characters' lines appear all together, before an exchange is half over.  If you've never seen this movie, and you have any serious interest in the development of the art form, you definitely ought to see it. But don't expect edge-of-your-seat tension throughout!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Amazing how the old school films had no need for all the gore and over-explicit graphics often used in modern filmography. This film offers a look at a very true and realistic problem that seems to have been haunting societies since old. It makes one see that fine line between true sickness of the mind and and a plain criminal one. This must have been a very controversial film for its time but it brings something that has to be dealt with. Again, is amazing how no over explicit graphics are needed in order to awake one's imagination. Not that I don't like graphics, is just that sometimes the imagination does a better job at imaging and bringing true tension to the scenes. Very well made film and classic for all times. Superb role for Peter Lorre. A better actor for this charachter could have never been found."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Perhaps the very first serial killer film ever made--way back in l931!Although, as far as directors go, I preffer the works of Claude Chabrol (especially Chabrol's The Butcher, over Lang's M), Lang's M holds up pretty damn well.What you really get here is three films in one: first third feels like a serial killer film, middle third feels like a police procedural, and the last third feels like a crime caper flick.For me, the first and last third worked exceptionally well. Peter Lorre convincing in the title role. Middle part (with the cops doing what cops do) lagged and felt drawn out, only because we have seen so many scenes like this over the years in other films of this nature.Friedkin interviews Lang in the two-disk package."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a chilling film about a child murderer who terrifies a Berlin neighborhood.  The police seem to focus on the lowly criminals and prostitutes in the area and seem more interested in making a show of the hunt at least in the beginning.  The community members are terrified and numb at first then become activist in hunting for the killer.  Police eventually bring in skilled investigators who come close to catching the killer.  The people use a blind possible witness for better effect.  What happens to the killer, who captures him and his explanation form the essential thought provoking finale.  Capital punishment, evil deeds and uncontrollable compulsions are discussed and become part of the story.  The psychological background of the killer, the police and the community were ground breaking at the time.  The DVD comes with a story booklet, several interesting documentaries and quite a lot of information on Fritz Lang and German film-making at the time.  I found all very interesting.  Loved them."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is one seriously disturbing movie. Fritz Lang created several masterpieces (e.g., Metropolis) in his career, but M is unique. This was Lang's first \"talkie\" and to be honest the dialog means little to your ears if you're watching M and can't understand German (you can read English subtitles - very well done in the recent criterion release on DVD). Yet the \"talkie\" nature of M is critical when Lorre's character whistle's chords from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt before each chilling moment. I found this use of a simple repeated musically element to be one of the most effective I have ever heard in a film. If you don't like subtitles M won't be your cup of tea, but if they don't bother you then check this movie out. You'll have chills for a while I promise! 5 stars!*This review is of the Criterion 1999 version."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is an astounding film. Peter Lorre gives a hauntingly brilliant performance as the twisted, yet sympathetic serial killer loosely based on real-life serial killers of the time (Fritz Haarman &amp; Peter Kurten). A serial killer is on the loose preying on little children. The police can't figure out who it is. The criminals who are sickened by the news decide to band together to track down the killer. Fritz lang does a brilliant job conveying the sheer terror that gripped the town as a monster roams the streets killing innocent children. A classic that deserves mentioning as one of the greatest achievements in cinema history."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is without hyperbole one of the best movies ever made.  When I first watched it, I was absolutely riveted.  While German cinema of this time period (1920s-1930s) was certainly edgy, experimental and deeply rooted in the social issues of the day, this movie stands above the rest.  It's one of the very first movies to examine the social problems of serial killers, pedophiles, mental illness and mob rule.  And all of this is delivered with Fritz Lang's incomparable film-making style.The newest Criterion release is definitely the best available.  Not only does the film look lovely with its new transfer, but there are plenty of informative extras to keep Lang's most ardent fans happy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Thats what discribes this movie. This is one of the best movies out there. It has a good cast and the costumes are awesome. To bad they didn't do that with the hulk. The costumes make the turtles & Splinter more life like. This is ttruely an awesome movie. I love this movie. The only thing wrong with it is that they didn't stay true to the Origin of the TMNT. But it is still an awesome movie i recomend it.If you like this movie Check out,1. TMNT 2: The Secret Of The ooze2. TMNT 33. TMNT The orginal soundtrack to the movie"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "TMNT really delivers on all fronts, good story, great acting, great directing and amazing action from guys in animatronic rubber suits.This movie is a perfect blend of the dark atmosphere of the original comics and the zany fun of the cartoon series, all the while maintaining a feeling of reality which takes it to the next level.The voice characterizations are right on and the acting from April and Casey Jones gives the validity to the story that it was really in need of.The first confrontation between Casey Jones and Raph in the park is one of the more memorable moments, while the Foot ninja attack on April's apartment is an amazing fight scene even by today's standards.I almost wouldn't consider this a kids movie, even though that's how it's marketed.  It's more along the lines of Spider-Man, than say, Power Rangers.  It got some \"Damn It's\" and the violence it pretty intense at times.Really a great movie and worth your money."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is one of those movies that I think has just been misstreaded when beeing put on DVD. The movie is great, but there are no bonus materials :(Ever since the film came out, we always wondered where that scene was that shows up on the trailer? a scene where the turtles are in the water, and there shells pop up... so with this DVD i was hoping there would be deleted scenes to satasfy that curiosity? But sadly, there isnt even a featurette:(And i know they made featurettes, i remember clearly all those years ago a guy punching in things on a key bourd, and the robotic head of Raphial it was hooked into was moving the facial features around.... so where are those features???For this decent price, its ok. The sewer game is forgetable, might occupy you for a few minutes?! But i'm very disapointed that there is no bonus features with this great ninja comedy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Yes, this movie is a classic. I feel very lucky to have grown up when the Ninja Turtles first became popular. This was back at a time when thought and care went into children's entertainment. Unlike the stuff kids are watching today. All of the characters in the Ninja Turtles series have distinct personalities and they're all lovable in their own way. If you loved this movie when you were a kid you'll still love it as an adult. Sure, the movie looks dated but it is far superior to the recent kids movies out there like &quot;Power Rangers.&quot;"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have always loved this movie.It was everything that the other Ninja Turtle movies were not.It was dark,and was a bit serious,but at the same time,there was humor in it.Both kids and adults could enjoy this movie.Although there is a few violent scenes(such as Shredder's death) that some parents might not want their kids watching...but that's up to the parents.Overall though,this is a really good enjoyable film.I thought the other Turtle movies were complete crap.I wish they would come out with a two disc special edition of this,with deleted scenes,commentary,and other cool stuff,because this is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time.Right up there with Tim Burton's Batman and The original Superman movie in my opinion."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Incredible.  If you have never seen Stomp live, then do it!  If that is impossible, then watch this video.  These masters of rhythm are awesome.  Whether they have a basketball, a broom, or a butcher knife in their hands, they create drama, energy and excitement through rhythm!  There are segments in this video that could not be performed live.  That is a bonus!  Also, the short documentary about &quot;Stomp&quot; is incredible!  My children love this as well.  Great for the whole family!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I think opera, as a tradition, tends to stagnate in, well...tradition. It's good that opera is also being expanded to the media of today. This for-film movie production takes all advantage that the video medium has to grant, without the limitations of a traditional filmed stage production. The acting is perfect (Domingo gets better every time I see him, and this performance tops the cake). The casting is very appropriate (Stratas is indeed the sickly prima donna!). Also, the cinematography and camera-work are the work one might expect from Hollywood, not from opera: superb!All in all, buy it for its creativity."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I just saw this for the first time a few days ago and I was awestruck.  &quot;La Traviata&quot; is my favorite opera, and to see Placido play the lead was so incredible.  Franco Zeffirelli did a fantastic job with this  opera-movie.  Visually, it is heaven for the eyes.  As for the acting, it  is a bit rough around the edges, but the beauty of the music makes up for  it.  Teresa Stratas' portrayal of Violetta is not the best I have heard.  Placido was amazing as usual.  The rest of the cast is good and the scene  with the gypsies and bullfighters was absolutely stunning.  This is a  must-see for opera fans and even people who don't care for opera would  enjoy it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I like this movie a lot because of the good performance and excellent photography.  Domingo's Alfredo is still good enough however, Stratas's Violetta is not good at all in Act I - her voice is quite annoying and it seems that she cannot adjust her breathing while she is singing - things become better when Germont shows up in Act II.  Sound quality is much better than that recorded in an opera house, so is the image quality.  It's a good choice for those who do not really enjoy opera (just like me) or who want to try something different."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As I understand it, this film was a revolution at the time, with Zeferelli opting for shooting as for a film rather than filming a stage production. As another commentator commented, the miming is not always perfect and lip movements and sung words don't always match. However, the sound of one of Verdi's greatest operas is wonderful and the soloists are great. Domingo is in his prime here, not only a splendid voice but also a great actor, and Teresa Stratas does an equally great job as Violetta. The production is gorgeous, a feast to the eye as well as the ear, and the party scene, with two stars of the Bolshoi Ballet in the starring dancing roles, is absolutely breathtaking (\"He really didn't do that, did he? Omigosh, he did it again!\"). A must for all lovers of opera."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Since we bought this when it was first on VHS (after watching the movie when it first opened) this is a replacement.The story is very cute as are the characters except for the villain, who's a cat.

It has remained one of her favorites even though she is now a SR in college (majoring in chemistry).The colors were vibrant and the animation is super! Voice talent was superb, including Dom Deluise.

(Some analogies are present here.)  During the storm boat trip, Fievel is lost at sea, and he finally washes up ashore in New York Harbor, where he vows to find his family.With the voices of Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, Nehemiah Persoff, and Christopher Plummer, this story will warm your heart.  A highly recommended movie!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Brilliantly animated, warm and tender, this movie is one of the few greats that Bluth did before he started putting out trash. Unless you don't like animated movies and are more into snakes and spiders, you WILL fall in love  with Fievel. Tiger is also another hit. While not as lovable as Jeremy from  The Secret of Nimh, he's more lovable than Itchy from All Dogs Go to  Heaven. Some of the elements that get amplified in Bluth's more poorly  crafted movies show up in this movie, but they don't detract from the  quality of this altogether enjoyable film."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When I was a little bitty kid back in the day (around the late 80s and the early 90s) I loved this movie so much. Everyday I came home from kindergarten I watched this in the late afternoon. I used to sit on the living room carpet, back against the couch and sing &quot;Somewhere Outthere&quot; over and over and over again. The movie was just good to me. I adored it. If I have kids, I would show them this movie because it's touching and it's universal. Recommended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First of all, i'm glad to see that i'm not the only not-kid (i'm 19) that still loves this movie and that cried when seeing it again...It's a great movie to see when you are a child, and a great movie to see through your life, until you could watch it with your own children.It's also an important movie: A friend of mine had a history teacher that said that this movie shows greatly the lives of the immigrants to America, so you'll also get a bit of history with it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wow. This is one of those animated movies you won't soon forget. With a wonderful score by James Horner, great story, and admirable characters, this is right up there with Disney's best.Basic plot: Boy gets separated from his family on their way to America by boat and must find his way back to them. On his journey, he meets new friends and enemies in one grand adventure in New York. Oh, did I mention the main character and his family are mice? Watch it and enjoy."}

When he arrives alone in the New World, he keeps up hope, searching for his family, making new friends, and running and dodging the cats he thought he'd be rid off. An American Tail easily one of the best animated features ever made, but it proves to be leaps beyond the efforts of recent Disney movies by refusing to be constricted to an all too familiar formula. A heartwarming story, beautiful songs, great performances and the animation is stellar. This is an excellent movie for all ages that will warm your heart"}

Meanwhile Miss Kitty Tiger's love interest tells Tiger she's heading west as well. Tiger decides he's going to head west to follow them and he falls off the stage. Both Fievel and Tiger wind up in the desert and eventually meet up and the adventure goes on from there. It's an interesting story and it's full of adventure for the little ones.

I thought it was very interesting to see Ray Manzarek's apartment in Venice, Ca where they lived and Jim Morrison lived there with them for a while.

I enjoyed the bonus extras as well; re: Manzarek student films, memorabilia gallery w/commentary and photo shoot for Morrison's HotelI hate to encourage a further money grab, but it would be nice to have a comprehensive \"ultimate\" collection w/everything available on one edition; not just material here, but all of The Doors available video stuff on one release. New menus, get rid of some the bad editing/silhouettes from Soundstage (if that's possible), new material (there's got to be some) etc. DMC is probably planning something like this for the future."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The answer, of course, is no. A lot of time has been spent whining about the stuff on Hullabaloo that wasn't really rock and roll. Sure, safe acts, crooners and Vegas swingers ruled on the show - particularly as hosts - but it all works as a beautiful period piece. Rock and roll was only a decade old when these shows were filmed, and TV execs were fighting a losing battle to co-opt it. The purity of performances by the Animals, the Yardbitds and the Byrds show how uncontrollable the energy was. Anyone who grew up in the era will love this. And if you remember the actual show, you'll spend days wiping that grin off your face."}

Unfortunately back then there were no VCR's to purchase or record it from the tv- we had to sit there and watch the entire movie at one sitting and take bathroom breaks during the commercials-how lucky kids are nowadays to be able to have videos/dvds in their home library. I love the innocence of Bambi and his friends-I especially love FLOWER and THUMPER. The digitally remastered version is fantastic and a joy to watch. I recommend this highly for your home library."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Designed in the Disney hay-day of great movies like \"Fantasia\" and \"Song of the South\" this shows what animation and great music was and could be now with a little effort.The story which is a little easer to take than the book chronicles the life of a young prince \"Bambi\" his friends and how he grew and matured.  He passes through many rights of passage and takes his place in the forest society.The down side of the story is the demise of Bambi's mother which though innovative for the time traumatized many children. To this day you hear it is a classic \"but I can not bring my self to watch it.\" How ever this presentation is more of a symphony based on the characters from the story in the Disney tradition.Many of the uncredited voices were of famous people; many of them were famous after this film was made.Lady and the Tramp (50th Anniversary Edition)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Although the animation is incredible.  In fact, Walt Disney's gorgeously drawn paean to Nature is one of the most beautiful animated films ever made.  And there are important Life lessons to be learned here as well, about love, loss, growth etc.  Kids weaned on \"The Incredibles\" and \"Finding Nemo,\" however, might be a bit bored.  There's no plot to speak of, the music is corny, the humor quaint.  Older kids in particular will probably want to switch to \"Spider-Man 2\" or their Nintendo.  To be honest, as an adult Disney fan I much prefer \"Pinocchio\" and \"Dumbo\" from this period, both of which have great humor, plot and lots and lots of heart. (And they're beautifully animated as well.) My humble opinion: \"Bambi\" is obviously an important and significant achievement in animation.  It's sweet, pretty to look at, but that's about all."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am very appreciative to Amazon.com, and Buena Vista Home Entertainment for sending my family and I this DVD (before it's public release March 1st).I have always loved this film. Bambi is a timeless treasure that I am glad I am able to share with my children.Made in 1942, the animation is flawless (my favorite scene is where it's raining, it's so perfect). The animators have truely captured the movement of each different type of animal that inspired the film. This is Disney at it's very best!Besides the wonderful animation, my children and I enjoy the humor. I love the owl talking to the older Bambi, Thumper, and Flower about all the animals being \"twitterpated\" in the Springtime; they all vow that it will never happen to them, but sure enough, one by one, they all fall victim to it.The flawless animation, the colorful imagery, cute, memorable characters, humor.

{"label": 6, "raw": "BAMBI is one of my favorite animated films produced from Walt Disney's creative genius. However, this DVD presentation of BAMBI somehow does not look true to Walt's original vision. The colors look over-enhanced and seem to alter the intention of the original filmmakers. My VHS and Laserdisc copies look much better than this DVD. You can see the original brush strokes if you look hard enough at those copies. Digital restoration seems to be getting to the point where restoration is now becoming recreation. There was a subdued natural look to the original BAMBI. This DVD looks too vibrant to the point where the colors seem to bleed into each other and become a distraction. Some of the innovations like the multiple plane shoots seem to lose their effectiveness. BAMBI is still an outstanding film exploring such themes as love, loss, coming of age and responsibility. These themes are artistically and dramatically represented here and they remain timeless."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is Disney's all-time best animated film!! You'll never forget new-born Bambi with his big eyes, discovering the world around him with the help of his friend, Thumper.  Bambi loses his mother in a heartbreaking scene that is very intense and unforgettable.  He grows up and becomes the new King of the forest.  There are beautiful songs and cute creatures to enjoy.  Bambi is my favorite Disney movie...sad, funny, and magical; this is the Circle of Life told at its best."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "At first, I wasn't sure if I really wanted to purchase this movie or not.However, nowI'm really glad that I have. I think I was reluctant because when I saw it the first time as a kid I didn't really understand what the purpose of the movie was. In a way, Bambi is a bit dark for kids. I love Bambi because of the simplicity of the storyline and the beauty of themusic. The music on its own is like another character and really describes what's going on in the movie.This D.V.D. set is wonderful because it goes inside Disney's private vault and it has some excellent games for all ages alike. I even found some of the games a bit more challenging then I would have liked. This is a really good family movie. However, I would suggest that children be a bit older to watchso that they completely understand what is happening in the movie."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Without trying to be a real scrooge, I think BAMBI, although one of his most endearing films, is not one of his best.  While beautifully animated, the movie itself is slim on plot with a heavy handed message against man's pillaging of the forests.  But basically the story is Bambi is born, Bambi is a clumsy youth and Bambi becomes a noble prince.  The supporting characters, including Thumper, are not utilized effectively and there are too many long shots of the forest with accompanying choral background.  Small kids should have fun, but older ones may end up yawning."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It's nice to see that some of the Disney classics get treated with the respect they deserve. After Dumbo got passed over, I wasn't sure it they would do any more deluxe 2 disc sets for these national treasures. 'Bambi' is the studios 5 full length animated feature film and is a testament to the animation, storytelling and loving care that when into these amazing features. Though 'Bambi' is not one of my personal favorites it is a beautiful film. The restoration is fantastic and the film looks better than ever!  The second disc is full of interesting extras, too many for me to go through in one sitting. I didn't see any trailers, but I would hope they are on this deluxe set."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Probably the greatest commercial animated film done by Walt Disney's amazing crew of animators in the &#34;glory&#34; years.  It is an amazing piece of work.  Some of the material the studio did for the military during WWII might rival it for animation prowess, but not for sheer storytelling on the commercial level.  It is simply great.  It was Walt's favorite and he agonized over Bambi's mom.  This is one they sure as hell don't make anymore.  I wonder how it would look if Pixar took a crack at it?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First off, I would like to thank Amazon publicly for providing me with a copy & the opportunity to review this much-anticipated release.  The folks at Disney have pulled off a remarkable feat in restoring this 1942 classic.  Nary a bit of grainy picture nor the usual pops and blips that normally accompany films of this age.  It has been completely revitalized and the audio has been given the \"enhanced home theater\" treatment which means you can watch it in a great new 5.1 mix or a restored version of the original mono soundtrack.  I found the enhanced version to be much more preferable.  This would be a great addition to any Disney DVD collection and look forward to \"Cinderella\" in Oct."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Sorry, Peter, but I grew up.Actually, it's more than that. Wendy is not exactly a feminist, after all, and the Indians are not in any sense Native Americans. The jokes about them are not the sort that would be acceptable today. And it's too late for the dream of a boy who never grows up. We've heard about \"The Peter Pan Syndrome,\" and I even married one. That was Husband Number Three, actually.There's also the fact that it's very much a boys' story, and for more reasons than the unrealistic depictions of females: Wendy, Tinkerbell and Tiger Lily. Even as a child, I didn't see the point to the fake combat against the Indians and the pirates. And I considered Peter impossibly arrogant; I still do.I would not recommend this to your children and grandchildren, unless you are prepared to do a good bit of explaining the differences between 1953 and 2012."}

We have to watch it every year at Christmas , 4 generations gather around the TV sometime during December to watch Peter Pan and a few other family favorite movies. We just love the animation and the way in which the story is told, it makes you wish Neverland was real and we could all be kids and play forever. We love watching our gandsons pretending to be Peter and fighting Hook. A huge bowl of homemade caramel corn, and beverage of your choice have been found by our family to only enhance the viewing pleasure!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "\"Peter Pan\" is classic Disney animation at its finest; heartfelt, humorous, lush and colorful.  And it's never looked better, in this digitally remastered release.  As an adult collector, however, I find the extras on this \"Platinum\" edition lacking in interest.  First of all, they're pretty much the same as those on the original DVD release of some years ago; and they're hardly comprehensive in their detailing the history of the film.  Given how extensive the Disney vaults are, it's hard to believe there was nothing new to be found.  And as I don't have kids, the games and sing-alongs are wasted on me.  I have most of the Platinum Editions and will continue to buy them for the films I love; I just wish they were a little more geared to adult animation wanks like me!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is one of my favorite movies from my youth. The story follows the book reasonable close. What child won't want to have this adventure - pirates, Indians - being able to fly - this movie has it all!The picture is VERY good - probably as good, if not better, than when it was first shown in the theaters. I've owned this on tape, DVD and now blu-ray.The night scenes over London remind me of the ride in Disney World - quite simply they are beautiful.Some of the songs, notably 'You Can Fly', fits the story almost like they were written when the book was!This is a movie for the ages. Certainly this is a movie all childern (and those young at heart) should see several times in their life. The lessions it has are timeless as well.The movie came quickly and in perfect shape - all at a unbeatable price.I would rate this a very strong 9.0 to 9.25 out of 10."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I own the special edition, but Im glad that they are finally releasing this great movie for all those who missed it when it was available last time. This version is probably the best ever released and the price is pretty reasonable. The special edition was only 1 disk and cost a bit more.Hopefully Pinnochio will be coming soon to Platinum. I have the limited edition and it's a pretty bad transfer (looks like straight from VHS with no clean up). However, Im holding on to it incase they censor the platinum version.I think this re-release of PeterPan is a signal that Disney is seeing the light. They are losing alot of revenue to chinese bootlegs being sold on [...], and god knows [...] doesnt give a crap about enforcement."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like many other thousands of people I am a huge fan of Disney animated classics so I am very happy that this edition of Peter Pan is available.  I always had a very active imagination as a kid and it kind of dwindled away as the years rolled on by so it is always enjoyable to watch this movie and think of never growing up.  The story is so fun and magical.  Now a little down side to this movie is I don't want my kids to try to fly out a window!!!  Do you think Michael Jackson is trying to have the face of Peter Pan it really does look like him with the large eyes and very small nose?"}

This is a movie we have owned a long time and it gets watched several times per year.  Pete&#65533;s Dragon is our most watched movie period but PD came in 3rd.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work.

Give me a break people, this movie was made a long time ago, when they made movies with a decent story line, and didn't compromise that to make all the poor little people happy.  Looses up. Don't talk to your kids about it being &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;  what next burn it 'cos it's offensive? Give me a break. Let peoople make movies properly, and don't worry about offending everyone in the world.  Most people aren't offended and out dumber those that for whatever reason are. Get a life."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Peter Pan is an uplifting fantasy. It portrays the desire of children to fly, have a magical friend, and travel to a world of adventure. Its a simple story with moral lessons. The biggest aftereffect is that it stimulates a child's imagination.Disney brings to life the classic children's story. After watching the movie all the way through I turned on the audio commentary by Roy Disney while watching it a second time. The background information on the film is fascinating and gives you an entirely different perspective. Walt Disney and those who provided the voices also have interesting things to say."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This digitally restored Platinum Edition of the Disney classic breathes new life into the movie, putting it in front of a new generation of viewers with more vibrant colors that stand out and surround sound that will make you jump off your couch.As for the story, it really never gets old. Like Dumbo, Pinnochio or Bambi, one can watch it over and over and feel like the first day, when you dreamed alongside the gang, that you could fly to Neverland.The extras contained definitely make for an interesting complement, with the segment with Disney himself topping the list. As a package, if you don't already own the movie, it's highly recommendable, and if you do, it may not be a bad idea to sell your used movie and get your hands on this great collector's item."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a Disney oldie but goodie, with lots of stuff that should keep just about anyone entertained. My parents enjoyed this when it came out, and I enjoyed it many years later. I have to admit that I am especially fond of Captain Hook, and all of the characters and storyline in this film were well-done. Some people will like this more than others - depending on personal tastes - but overall this is a great Disney classic and if you're a Disney fan, you'll want to check this out!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I expect this akin to heresy but I didn't much like this film.  I never saw it as a kid but was certainly put off when I saw the iconic characters in their actual (animated) performances.Peter Pan is a bit of a punk, -- certainly not a role model for any child.Tinkerbell is downright malicious.  The mermaids aren't much better.The positive is that the voice actors do an incredible job.  Truly perfect performances throughout.The negative is that the script itself makes Never-Never Land seem like a dysfunctional playground.  Maybe that's the point, as I've not read the book this is based upon, but it doesn't fit well in my mind of a Disney classic, especially one that formed a major pillar upon which the entire Disney franchise was based upon."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you don't currently own Peter Pan, and love the movie, you still have time to buy it on video and dvd. But hurry up because Peter Pan and along with Beauty and the Beast, Beauty and the Beast The Enchanted Christmas and Return to Neverland are going out of stock on 1/31/03. Along with some other titles. Whether you believe it or not that Peter Pan's voice died in 1968 because he had been abusing himself and his body was founde by kids playing in an abanded village bulding but I think it took sometime to to discover he was the voice of Peter Pan."}

The hippies crashed the fences and didnt give a crap about the promoters and other men and and women who put the festival on. Feeling they can just storm in and not have to pay for an event and just stiff the promoters to have to dig in their own pockets to pay the artists and everything else,  With Woodstock tho, the promoters already had a film and record deal signed and wasnt too concernd about tickets but they still took a huge financial hit.Great documentary about the so called \"love child\" generation that were just as selfish and spoiled as the ME generation, same crap, different title.Wish the film were still a bit longer but it is what it is.Great performances by Jimi Hendrix, Janis and many others."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It's great to see this concert film again. The split-screen effect still holds up, even if it's a bit distracting to the enjoyment of the musical performances. Richie Havens and The Who still stand out as incredible sequences in the film. I'm not such a fan of mud, but these people actually make mud dancing look like fun. There's an incredible story about why the Woodstock festival actually took place in Bethel. A guy named Elliot Tiber issued a concert permit to the Woodstock organizers from the Bethel Chamber of Commerce, where he was a member. The rest, as they say, is history. The Elliot Tiber story is told very well in a forthcoming book called TAKING WOODSTOCK. Keep an eye out for it on Amazon; it should fast become the perfect preamble to watching this movie.

{"label": 6, "raw": "Who hasn't seen this yet? The older it gets, the more contemporary it seems. Just a different war now than 40 years ago. The clothing and hair styles are pretty much back in 2009, same as 1969. The film is edited such that actual events and musical performances are not in line with how it really happened. For example, Sha Na Na went on right before Hendrix on Monday morning, but this is edited to look like they were on mid-show. The performances that have held up best: Joe Cocker, Santana, Hendrix, CS&N. Even at more than three hours, this still omits probably 40-50 hours of musical performances, not to mention all the other film that was shot. I loved the apocalyptic ending showing the garbage, smoke from fires and the mud left over. And the scroll of all the dead from that era is sobering."}

I suppose it would be immoral if they didn't tell us they did it.  But they told us.  They even made a video to show the process, which is pretty amazing.So quit complaining and turn it up!And oh yeah, groovy.Kaz"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "While I like the multichannnel remix overall I'd say if you already have the Directors cut DVD then I wouldn't spend the money on the Blu-Ray.  The picture on the DVD looks the same on the Blu-Ray which makes sense since I would guess that the original footage was shot in 16mm.  The audio on the other hand sounds much better than on the DVD. If you're an audio purist than you probably won't like the multichannel mix, but I'm not a purist so I enjoyed it.  If you haven't seen the Director's cut then definiately buy the Blu-Ray.  The extra footage is worth the price."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'm writing this review just to be contrary.  What makes the movie  worthwhile is that the music is mixed with &quot;mundane&quot; footage -  the performances weren't generally outstanding at Woodstock, while the  sheer magnitude of the event, and the problems it caused (food shortages,  sanitary problems, disturbance of the Woodstock locality), are special and  worth including for the permanent record.  If you miss more songs from your  favorite performers, consider how long this film would be if every artist  received generous treatment from the film makers.  For my taste, anyway,  there's more than enough music and lots of stuff that most people who  attended the event never had a chance to see.  Woodstock is well worth the  3 or 4 hours it takes to see it all, and I'm glad it isn't 6 or 8 hours  long."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A great introduction for those who missed out (like I did), but not so much a documentary or a concert. I supposed it is very difficult to fit 3 days into the time alloted, but it's oftentimes very difficult to watch as  some songs are cut short... the cameramen can't find the subject they're  shooting... the filmmakers often focus on mundane topics rather than  grabbing the full excitement of the event. Don't get me wrong - it's a  great piece of history - it just doesn't seem to capture the best of it,  IMHO."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Woodstock was the high point of the late sixties.  It was a time of innocence and pain.  It was a time when we who were young were members of a tribe - we cared for each other and shared visions of a better world.  Yes, there were problems - bad drugs, lack of sanitation, and the like.  But it worked in its time.  The movie captures this mood so well, both in the interviews and in the music.  The multiple frames help to show the different aspects of life at Woodstock so well.  I'm not sure if those who are younger now can truly understand why Woodstock was so important - maybe this film will help them to understand."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "My Son is really into \"old school\" music and after visiting Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he really wanted a movie about Woodstock. I came across this Collector's Edition on Amazon and took a chance. HE LOVES IT! A ticket came inside which he laminated and put up in his dorm. He just loved all the little goodies inside the packaging. The tamborine on top is really sturdy and a nice touch. The footage itself is rich and very well done. The bonus footage includes some of the 'flavor' of the 60's as well. Great gift."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was a really terrific film.  I wish they could've made a series of films like this to capture the entire festival, but this comes as close as we've got I guess.  As it was, I felt transported and when it was over, I was sad to leave it.  Really glad I got the director's cut!  This is a great historical document that captures not only the music (though I wish there were more), but the climate (political and natural) surrounding the festival as well.  Whether you were there or wish you could have been, this is a great trip!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Without question this was a landmark movie. Some of the greatest acts in rock and roll were able to perform in this movie.

The music in the movie was very good. The on the scene footage was also well shot. You were able to see Woodstock from every perspectivein this movie. That this video is till available 32 years lateris a testament to this event. Buy this and watch it. It is a collector's item."}

Probably the beginning of drug abuse/sexually transmitted diseases in this contry and who knows what else. I still would have liked to have been there. Nothing compares to this event. Not something to sit and watch with your kids unless they are in their late teens. This is where Ten Years After really go their big start.

It took place 100 miles away in a town called Bethel, New York.This festival portend the social nassissistic self-indulging climite that now pollutes American culture."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the seminal rock film of all time.  I remember reading about the concert in \"Rolling Stone\", wondering about going, it sounds pretty good.  But I was still in high school on the west coast, and the surf was up that summer.  Then, when it hit the television news, the whole thing took up a life of its own...spontaneous combustion!  Then the three-record set came out, the movie came out, the poster came out, the magazine coverage, and the books.  With the passing of time, it's great the director's cut has been released, revealing more of what happened at the original Woodstock.  Drop some brown acid, and take a wild ride!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "i remember watching this movie when i was young. if i could refresh my memory, i remember the movie started off with julie and sara getting on their mother's nerves. when they overheard their stressful mother complaining how things are getting too much with her including the twins, the twins misunderstood thinking that she doesn't want them anymore. they then packed up their things and decided to lived with their grandmother. they hopped on some delivery truck and hooked up with bad people along the way. they eventually found their grandma and the bad guys went off to jail. i do remember towards the end the twins, their mother, and the delivery man went on some game show and SUPRISE!!! Bob Saget and Lori Laughlin make a cameo in this movie. gosh, i really do enjoy watching mk & ashley's movies. it seems that all of their movies up until perhaps our lips our sealed were great. everyone should get this film, it's a great christmas film for the whole family to enjoy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This movie is a classic and is done by Rankin and Bass, the same people who gave you &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;This movie was made a year after i was born, and didn't see it until I was about sixteen i think (memory is the first thing to go, you know)  I first watched it when it was on the Disney Channel (I'm not kidding here)  and I taped it.  I still have the tape, but not the Disney Channel.James Earl Jones makes an execellent bad guy named Omodon.  This movie also stars John Ritter from the &quot;Problem Child&quot; movies.If you liked The Hobbit or The Last Unicorn, you'll love this!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When I first got this movie, I was expecting a stupid, cheesy \"Puff The Magic Dragon\" wanna be kind of show.  It was only purchased because it was one of those deals...of \"Buy this movie with this other movie\".  And it was listed with the movie of \"Heidi's Song\", so I figured, \"Why not?\"  It stayed in my collection and collected alot of dust for a several months.  Then one day I decided to put it in and see how bad it really was.  To my surprise, it turned out to be an OK show.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't as bad as I was expecting either.  So all in all, it was OK."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is deep, serious fantasy stuff, not messing around or tarnishing the image of the dragon. It has a strong story, fantastic villains, and even a deep philosophy behind the story. Plus, it doesn't get graphic with the  violence, so the whole family can watch it. It also has a fantastic theme  song. You just have to hear it! It will make you cry, and you will be  singing it for days. As much as I enjoyed Willow, I believe that this is  the perfect fantasy movie. Forget Dragonheart, and what I've read about  Dragonslayer makes it sound unsuitable for kids. If you're touchy about  things like drunken behavior, then keep the really young kids away.  Otherwise, enjoy this fantastic movie. Watch for Sir Orin Neville-Smythe's  prayer. It has to be one of the best monologues in any movie ever. If you  like this movie, I also recommend The Last Unicorn."}

However the DVD was released in Standard format only (full screen) which is way lame.And Hitchcock performed many other songs that were filmed that could've easily been included here. the Soundtrack CD contains a bunch of songs not in the film (and the Soundtrack Vinyl LP contains a few more).It's nice that Demme would make this film but why is it SOOO brief?I mean his Talking Heads film Stop Making Sense is nearly two hours in length.Come on, 77 Minutes?!?It's shame that it took so long to be released on DVD/VHS to begin with but why itwas given such a half baked-release is beyond me.Hitchcock deserves much better."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Raised 3 kids, thought I knew most of the techniques for ssothing babies, helping them through rough days (colic, teething, fussy times). But this video brings NEW research and tips to make life easier for parents of new babies...and if you're an aunt or grandparent, you'll learn something new too. SOme of the suggestions are simply amazing, making specific sounds gently into the baby's ears and seeing an instant, peaceful transformation.Many of these suggestions come from looking at life from the baby's perspective and, in retrospect, seem like common sense (but not as easy as it sounds, otherwise there'd be no need for this video). Well worth your viewing time and could bring relief to many an exhausted parent (and baby)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "My husband and I were skeptical.  I bought this DVD on a whim and it stayed in its wrapper for 2 weeks before we watched it.  Our baby fussed for 2 hours at night, fighting sleep, but obviously exhausted, well fed, and wearing a clean diaper.  My daughter fussed while we watched the video and we calmed her right there as we watched the techniques.  We can get her to sleep in less than 5 minutes, rather than try to calm her fussing for over an hour, like we had done before.It really works!  We are now the Happiest Parents on the Block!  Our baby is calm and well rested.  We are less stressed.  We are giving it to all our pregnant friends as part of their baby gifts."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought several meditation CD's from Amazon but \"Goodbye Worries\" is by far the best.There are 4 different sessions on this CD, so it is kind of like getting 4 for the price of 1.  One of the other CD's I bought claimed to be a \"half-hour of peace\" but when you take away the introduction and the music at the end, it was only 15 minutes.There are currently 30 reviews for this posted and all of them give it 5 stars.  This is the best $10  I have ever spent.  Buy this CD.  You will not regret it."}

I love the suggestions to visualize and focus on positive thoughts.  Roberta says, &#34;If you're going to have dreams, have good ones!&#34; I love it!  I listen to this, at times, while I'm at work to help get me through my day and sometimes at night.  The only problem about listening to this at night time is that I fall asleep! LOL!!!  Which, is suggested to be a good thing, because our minds still absorb the information.  I would recommend this tape to anyone who is trying to manage their stress.  The music and Roberta's voice are an amazing combination that touches the heart."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A classic of jazz, the studio work of these 2 giants together in this mid to late 1950's period put forth some of the greatest sounding music ever layed down.Hawkinks the master,Webster,the sweet soul bluesman on these tracks are an amazing display of blues,and jazz with the great Oscar Peterson on piano.There are a whole slew of recordings done in this 1950's era for Verve comprising a similiar lineup of these stellar musicians and many are on the Veve master-editions issue...not to be missed for those exploring are the Genius of Coleman Hawkins,Ben Webster and Associates,Ben Webster meets Oscar Peterson,Ben Webster's Soulville..these releases were all repackaged with liner notes and given great treatment..All of these \"senior\" masters were given their due late on in their careers but the greatness of their youth is revisited on this and the other fine releases."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "One of the most beautiful records ever made. The \"Master Edition\" sound quality lets you truly hear the heartrending tone of these tenor giants. Beyond jazz, this will move anyone with a pulse. After seven tracks that leave you emotionally stunned, where you kept turning it up to savor every nuance of tone and feeling, you suddenly get the sound of a recording engineer barking into a mike! The fools just had to fill some unused CD real estate and mar one of the most beautiful records ever made with some let's look behind the curtain \"Blues for Yolanda\" outtakes! Why not use \"Maria\" and \"Cocktails for Two\", tracks from the same session I've found on other compilations? So be ready to shut down your CD player after \"Shine On Harvest Moon\". Grafitti on the Mona Lisa, fercrysakes."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Recorded in 1957 this session captures Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster duelling on Tenor Saxophones. The standard is set on the opening track ' Blues for Yolande'. This is a steady driving blues. Hawkins takes the first solo and after two choruses lets rip on the 3rd chorus with as raucous a blues riff as you're ever likely to hear on a Tenor Saxophone.Whether 'Blues for Yolande' was the first recorded track I don't know, but it wouldn't surprise me if that was Coleman Hawkins putting down a marker. Of course later on Ben Webster gets a chance to shine with some of his brilliant breathy ballad playing.The rhythm section is Alvin Stoller on drums, Ray Brown on Bass, Herb Ellis on Guitar and Oscar Peterson on Piano. As the previous reviewer said these guys are as good as it gets.A marvellous album that grows on you with repeated listens."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It is not 100% guaranteed, but the recording is relaxing enough to make sleep a real possibility. Be warned: The Delta Sleep System is NOT designed for a room-sized music system; in fact it can be downright irritating coming through big speakers. It works best with a headset on personal players like ipods and mp3 players. (Yes, you can fall asleep wearing headphones - if you use the in-the-ear buds instead of the monster head sets.) My biggest gripe is that the recording has an abrupt break in the middle - like the company is still making vinyls with only 30 minutes per side, not cds. Wish they'd made it a single, seamless recording. If I'm not fully in the zone, that break is especially annoying."}

It's great for older Scooby Doo fans."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've always adored \" Scooby Doo\" since i was 8 and this movie was a excellent comeback for him, i saw this on Cartoon Network and thought it was great.It's the story of Scooby, Shaggy and friends who take a vacation in a southern made Island to investagate a strange going on, now they discovered that the Island is cursed by dark forces including the undead, will they make it out alive or end up as bait for the darkness?Very entertaining and thrilling Scooby flick inspired by the old 40's voodoo flicks and Lucio Fulci Italian horror flicks, this is a must see for fans of Scooby or Zombie lovers.Similar movies recommended: Lucio Fulci's Zombie, City of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Cat People, An American Werewolf in London, Day of the Dead, Lucio Fulci's The Beyond, Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Return of the Living Dead, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie and Creepshow."}

Thank goodness Warner Brothers took pity on us Scooby fans and released Zombie Island in 1998!Adrienne Barbeau and Mark Hamill lend their voice talents to this excellent release. I like that they made the monsters real this time. This is an excellent first release for a new generation of fans."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have to admit that I have always had a soft spot for the Powerpuff Girls.  I find the frequently tongue-in-cheek humour to be very witty and like most good cartoons are, this one is thoroughly entertaining for both kids and adults alike.  My favourite Cartoon Network character is actually Dexter's Lab but until they release that on DVD I guess this will have to do as second best.  This DVD has been very well thought out and designed and contains good bonus features as well as 10 great episodes.  Highly recommended for a good laugh!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The eqipment used to make this movie was only fair. HOWEVER, for good reason this my favorite. The performances of The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Otis Redding, Janis Joplin, and more, are terrific. It is quite fun to see Mama Cass's reaction to Janis Joplin's \"Ball and Chain.\" The ending of the festival is fantastic-- Ravi Shankar's group plays the longest and most wonderful raga, or whatever one would call it. Have you ever listened to some performer-- and the performance is so incredible that at the end you stand up applauding? The performance has literally pulled you out of your seat? Well Shankar's raga pulled everyone out of their seat-- even Micky Dolenz of the monkees. I have owned the video for 20 years or so, and it is by far the best 60s rock concert I have ever heard.-- Sam Yulish, author of WHERE HAVE ALL THE HIPPIES GONE and THE HESITANT PSYCHIC AND OTHER STRANGE STORIES."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The historical significance of this video is when Jimi arrived at Monterey  he was an unknown and before the concert Black artists in Rock music besides Arthur Lee of Love were big at that time in the &quot;Soul&quot; catagory only.  Hendrix understandably  nervous came thru big time and broke all stereotypes.  Monterey is clearly his best concert video for entertainment purposes with Jimi playing behind his head, the burning antics at the end, his funny comments between songs and the audience reaction to seeing him for the first time.  Also included in this film is some good background information on the Monterey Pop Festival by John Phillips.  If you're looking though for straight guitar playing, Jimi is better at &quot;Berkeley&quot;."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Performance is HISTORIC and LEGENDARY, but... where's the DVD? I have this entire show on CD and it's one of my most widely listened to records. The Performance / Artistry goes without saying. This (Other than Live At Woodstock - which i'm still waiting for the complete Hendrix Woodstock perormance on DVD, not the crappy edited version which leaves out half the songs - other than Woodstock this is Hendrix at his film/recorded BEST. I'm gonna buy this tape right now cause' i've been wating for the DVD for 4 years and it still aint' been released."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was not impressed when this started: the sound is rubbish, the video quality not much better, and poor old Alice is almost falling-down drunk. Things do improve tho, and when we get to the final series of songs - Black Widow, Steven, and the incendiary School's Out, ALice is bringing the house down. I was converted. I've always loved Welcome To My Nightmare, and was stoked to see Tony Levin playing on this - although interestingly uncredited.As several others have said, for all its faults this is history in the making and it deserves its place in the rock pantheon."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This concert is one of the greatest of all time. The performance of Alice, his band, and the whole \"Nightmare\" concept is absolutely ahead of it's time, and still holds up today. Alice set the standard in theatrical rock. Sure, he was a little drunk, but so what? He still put on one hell of a show- this is pure sick and twisted theater.  Accept no substitutes. This production and concept changed the face of live rock and roll performance. So many bands and performers have copied, and been directly influenced by Alice Cooper. Even U2 used his \"movie screen\" idea in one of their stage shows.The whole \"Welcome To My Nightmare\" album is performed, along side original Cooper band classics, like \"I'm Eighteen\", and \"Billion Dollar Babies\". Recommended!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Welcome to my nightmare is a dream of a concert. Rarely does the Alice Cooper character show such emotion than the violence he portrays. Yet only women bleeds he shows his guilt and sorrow that he could treat this woman so bad. My heart actually went out to this character. Vincent Alice Cooper really showed what a great actor he really is in this concert a genius. So buy this welcome to my nightmare concert and realize what a dream to own it. The split screan technolngy will really blow your mind to.But don't take my word for it. Buy it yourselves and experience the dream yourself."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I just finished watching this DVD. IT SUCKS! I thought it was the TV Special. It was Alice Cooper's concert for the album. The video is bad. So is the audio. The cover says it's \"REMASTERED\". If this is remastered. I'd hate to see the original. If you're looking for the actual TV Special, look for the one that is under 120 minutes AND does not include his hits from the previous years as this disc does. SHAME ON RHINO FOR GIVING US THIS CRAP!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the best Darin DVD available - Bobby died several months after this performance.  This incredible DVD showcases better than any - and better than many of his CDs- the range of talent this man embodied.  From \"Beyond the Sea\" to \"Midnight Special,\" you get 200 percent of everything Bobby had to give. His energy in this performance is incredible, almost as if he knew it was his final. What's more, this performance had not been thoroughly rehearsed, Bobby had his oxygen sitting backstage to take hits from between songs, and if you watch closely, you'll see him working to get blood circulating through his hands. This is Bobby Darin at his cumulative best and shows what he could do with a song that no other vocalist can do."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am a huge fan of Bobby Darin but this video is just terrible. Instead of hearing Darin songs I want to hear I'm forced to hear songs like \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and \"Midnight Special\" might I add these songs are performed terribly. He sings Mack the knife And Beyond The Sea but he sings them boringly (is that even a word) and lame. no enthusiasm at all. I wish they would give out a tape of him in his earlier years so it would be more entertaining."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Just when you thought it was safe to finally put away those blue suede shoes, along comes yet another piece of Presley paraphernalia, the time on DVD. Actually, this is a superb collection of rare, early recordings and never-before-seen black-and-white and color footage that proves just why we still love him tender. Narrated by Levon Helm of the band, the DVD time travels back to the year when-rock-and roll was still in its infancy and a young man hip-swiveling Southern boy was about to Make It Big. Even after all these years, the King's infamous appearance on Ed Sullivan's show still hounds us with delight."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Bernadette Peters remains one of the most striking performers on the musical stage, with a palpable presence reaching for miles. This concert features some of her old gems (&quot;Unexpected Song&quot; &quot;Raining in  My Heart&quot; &quot;Time Heals Everything&quot;), a wonderful selection of  Sondheim songs, a radiant joy, and a self-assured sense of humor (Too bad  &quot;making love alone&quot; wasn't on the video). &quot;Hello Little  Girl&quot; is perhaps the only weak moment in the show for my tastes, but  cannot even begin to dampen my enthusiasm for Ms. Peters's delightful  abilities."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Frankly I'm at a loss why some previous commentators have come down so harshly on this performance.  There are very few really good videos of Gilbert and Sullivan available on video and this is one of those.  The staging is imaginative, the production, acting, singing and dancing are all excellent and great fun (Maureen Forrester is wonderful as the Queen of the Faeries!)  I encourage anyone who enjoys G&S; to see this.For my money, here are the really good videos of G&S; to watch:1. Mikado (Stratford)2. Iolanthe (Stratford)3. HMS Pinafore (D'Oyly Carte) (truncated & hard to find but worth it)4. Pirates of Penzance (Australian Opera)all other videos are a mixed bag and of varying quality (avoid the Eric Idle performance of Mikado at all costs)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Well, I thought I was a fan of The Shadow radio shows from the 1930's.  I've heard a bunch, and own a bunch, and in this box set here's only two I've heard before--\"Prelude to Terror,\" about a loony who concocts exploding light bulbs and plants them in strategic buildings. [..] then there's \"Reflection of Death,\" about a mirror from Inferno itself--or is it now?  Many of these feature Bill Johnstone as the Shadow, and believe me, he may have been the best of any of the men who played that role.  Each man brought his own flair to the role. the one I like least is kid Orson Welles, who hadn't yet panicked America and made his name forever. When these shows were made, he was still riding by ambulance from show to show--no joke, he did just that.  This is money well spent."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I remember buying this soundtrack in the '90s, before I saw the movie, and loved how weird it was. There were a few songs that weren't composed by Goldsmith, and then there was the bit with Alec Baldwin as the Shadow. \"Original Sin\" is an awesome song; I listened to it so much back then. And Goldsmith's themes are memorable. I doubt you could hum it to someone and have them know where it's from, but I still think it's great and works perfectly with the movie. One of Jerry's best '90s efforts, most definitely."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "My daughters (1 and 2.5 years) love this video - it's their favourite of all the Barney videos.  Lots of singing with relatively simple dance moves they can follow along with.  All the children in it look like they are having a good time and it's not just set in the tree house - a real farm with real animals is in it, a camping ground, a make-believe fairy book land and the school yard are all scenes for songs in this video.  If you like Barney songs you'll love this video.  Great value for money."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First, let me start off by saying, I bought this DTS DVD before I even had the surround speakers, and I wouldn't watch it until I got it all set up.  It was worth the wait!  If you like Tina, and even if you don't (this will  change your mind) and you want to see an incredible concert DVD get this!  Tina is amazing.  Her version of Proud Mary rocks, and it is hands down the  best song &amp; dance routine I have ever seen!  Her dancers are  outstanding and have to give their all to keep up with Tina.  It's like Tae  Bo x 10!  Also, her musicians rock the house.  Get it, you'll enjoy it!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you ever wonder how a 60 year old soul/pop/rock star can still draw the attention of 150000 fans, then buy this dvd.  Tina is pure showwomanship pouring energy and sympathy over a raving dutch crowd. The director keeps  our attention focused on the whole setting and leaves us wanting for more.  The Greatest Hits format of the concert is wonderful and the sound quality  is great!  Also note the lip synch that the stage screen and live Tina  accomplish in River Deep, Mountain High and the coreography involved in the  Goldeneye number. Great dvd, BUY IT!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have to agree with the earlier reviewer that mentioned the bad sound recording on this DVD.  The visuals, of course, are as wonderfully Tina as expected.  I don't understand how and why the sound is so &quot;strange.&quot;  ... even though their are two versions (of the sound) from which to choose.  I'm not sorry that I purchased it, however.  This is my favorite Tina Turner concert.  The selection of material is perfection and the energy comes across like a volcano erupting.  I love Tina more than ever, and look forward to her next DVD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am a big Tina Turner fan who personally thinks she sounds better on record, than live.  This concert is enjoyable, but after awhile her voice is annoying because she tends to scream.  Tina has a good voice, but not great, in my opinion.  Her studio recordings have always sounded better probably because she can do them again and again until she gets them perfect. Concerts don't allow such luxuries.This DVD is available in a 5.1 surround sound version, or DTS version.  I have the 5.1 surround DVD and it is more than adequate.  I have to ask why the concert wasn't filmed in widescreen to give the viewer more of a feel for the concert.The DVD also includes a lengthy interview with Tina where she discusses each track of the then new album &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;.  The interview, while promotional based, is very enjoyable and contains video excerpts for each album track."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "From his wit, warmth, and brilliantly precise and accurate use of language, to a band that cannot be topped, as a whole or as individual players, this is a transcendent performance.  His voice is gorgeous, his use of words sharp and equisite, so apt no other words could do, and his demeanor joyful and welcoming.And that's the singing part of it.As great and seriously fun are his thematic interludes and poems.Stellar all around.Difficult to find, prices at premium, yet worth every penny, dime, and dollar."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The line between God's music and the devil's music has always fascinated me in my search for the untold stories of Robert Johnson, Robert Lockwood Jr. and Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller). On the way I had the privilege of taking communion at Rev. Green's Full Force Tabernacle in Memphis and a long video interview with the Rev. Willie Morganfield (Muddy's cousin).This Robert Mugge documentary captured Green at his most contemplative and charismatic. Get it, set aside a night when you can focus your attention and watch it with your best gal/guy and you will share a meaningful experience. A nice California red of your choice would be a fine accompaniment."}

He does that to a song. Whether it is a remake or new, he gives it his all.  He will be missed, but I now have a collection of DVDs, and CD's to listen and watch whenever!!  I had just recently said to a co-worker, how I was looking forward to Luther recovering from his stroke and possibly performing again, until his untimely death, however, I realize now that I can see him concert or videos whenever I choose, and keep his memory alive.  The one, the only, Luther (Ronnie) Vandross.  Rest in Peace!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Whether you're a fan of Gloria Estefan or not you really should see this concert spectacle. Gloria really knows how to define a live performance. She delivers one of the most spectacular concert events I've seen, one that  leaves many of her contemporaries in the shade. With her distinct and  belting voice, her high energy almost aerobic performance she really knows  how to hold your attention and with a string of hits ranging back over 15  years crammed into over 2 hours, a magnificent ever changing stage, a  flying overhead cage, elevators, drag queens and afro cuban dancers this  has to be one of the best concert DVD's so far and one of the biggest shows  this decade. The picture quality is crisp and well defined, it's just a  pity that the sound is not an AC3 track however the stereo surround sound  is sufficinet and ambient enough for you to &quot;feel&quot; present."}

He captured our hearts because his own heart was bigger than any person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. His music and dancing will live on forever as long as we listen to his songs and watch his short films. I don't want the world to forget this beautiful creature who took the basics of entertaining and catapulted them into the moves we've been attempting to copy for years.

I didn't like Janet 'giving the finger' in the video nor them using the 'f' word (the word is partially bleeped out), and especially since Michael was such an advocate for the children, but I guess we have to have a flaw somewhere.I really felt Michael as I listened to 'Childhood' and I wish that the public could have really known him; not just what the tabloids put out there about him."}

No matter what the press says, he is truly amazing & one of a kind! The 1995 MTV performance is just show stopping & the proof is in the standing ovation he gets when he finishes. I also loved the Blood on the dance floor video because for the first time, it shows Michael partner dancing with another girl which looks hot. I like the teaser at the beginning & it has a better version of the Smooth Criminal video than the Number Ones DVD. It even includes the legendary Motown 25 performance where he performs Billie Jean & for the first time, does his iconic moonwalk. This DVD is a must have for all fans & those who want to see some of Michael's best work!"}

If you are not - getting this CD will let you see the creative talent of him, his producers, writers and directors have been.Children will love the visuals and adults should get the messages.

This video shows Ozzy and his band performing in a few different shows.  I think it's interesting to see more than one concert.  The songs are great, the ones that were chosen are the very best from his career.  The band performs well and Ozzy's voice is excellent.  There is also Ozzy performing Black Sabbath with the original members from that band.  It's neat to see them all together again.  This is one of my very favorite videos, regardless of type.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This supposed concert video is nothing but a collection of nonsense pre-concert, backstage, and audience garbage video. It shows 2 second clips of actual \"live\" band footage intermixxed with camera shots bouncing all over the place. A real concert video is just that, a live video of a band on stage playing their songs. Thank GOD I bought a cheap VHS version. I never even watched the whole thing. If you want to see a real show check out Iron Maiden's Rock In Rio or Primal Fear's The History Of Fear. This crap wouldn't be worth watching if it was sent to you for free!!!! I can't imagine Ozzy ever saw this and approved its release."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "Once upon a time, say somewhere between 1994 and 1997, I'm convinced that OASIS truly was the meanest, biggest and bleedin' greatest band alive. They held the world in their hands and threw it on a roller coaster ride, of which a piece is caught in this video. Noel Gallagher had the talent of 100 years of composers together, Liam had enough charisma for a millennium. Yes, it was there and then and today's Oasis perhaps only have the shell left ot these days - but it doesn't really matter, since the wonders this band made during these years (perfectly sumaried in this video) is enough for a thousand lifetimes.

They must be the only band in the world that don't have a live concert to buy whenever you walk into a virgin megastore or a wallmart! It's frustrating! They should have even released an &quot;OH YEAH!

Watching her perform adds another layer of integrity to her music. There is a good selection of her music and the performance itself is a delight. Interspersed with the music are clips of behind the scenes preparation and interviews with other singers. I think MCC's greatest gift is her ability to connect with those who listen to her; this video makes it all the more evident."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I love RATM. I was at the Irvine Meadows concert shown in this video - unfortunately, that one is the worst of the ones shown. It was a great show, but it's just poor quality. Part of that is because it's at night,  but it also seems kind of poor anyway. The other shows are pretty good, but  the video has flaws. The video collection is cool though, although the ones  from the first album are basically just Rage live, they're awesome."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Included on this DVD is footage from two concerts, two appearances on television's \"Austin City Limits.\" I thought this was easily the best of the three Stevie Ray concert tapes (DVDs) I've seen. All of them are good, however.Most of this is from the 1989 concert but I enjoyed the three songs from the '83 concert the most. They seemed to be the most intense and the most impressive. The latter adjective mainly describes his work on \"Voodoo Chile.\" To my knowledge, Vaughan is the only guitarist to successfully imitate the late-and-great Jimi Hendrix. (Although SRV's vocals aren't as good.)After 40-some minutes of rocking blues and rock, there is a change-of-pace and beautifully done jazz instrumental called \"Riviera Paradise.\" Featured on that piece is keyboard player, \"Reese Wynans,\" who does an outstanding job.This is a feel-good, great music and most of it would make for a good aerobic-workout music, too."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you are a big SRV fan you'll  be happy to have this.  Is it top quality?  Does it include as many songs/performances as I'd like? No and No.  However, I am thrilled to have this.  Even before he got clean, SRV just knew how to perform each and every time because the music came from deep within him.  I am so glad he sobered up and was able to help others.  He is an inspiration as a musician and a insightful human being.  Glad he lives on despite leaving us in physical form."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Stevie Ray Vaughan was one awesome guitar player and underatted singer. The footage of the two concerts is a joy to watch. The second concert is a little better because it feature the talents of keyboardist, Reese Wynas who is a perfect foil for Stevie.However, this video should be so much longer. It clocks in at a mere 63 minutes and features three songs from one concert, six from another, the closing credits, and video clips of great guitarists with Little Wing playing in the background. All these scene changes are disruptive to the viewer. Also, more songs are needed. Nothing from the Soul to Soul record.Whereas Stevie Ray was a blue ribbon talent, I am sure there are more comprehensive concerts feature this late legend."}

There is not one wrong note -- it's complete bliss.  I was lucky enough to see him about four months before he passed, and it was the most fantastic musical experience of my life.  I remember it like it was last week.  He played with everything he had and it was beautiful.  I've been listening to him for years and I never get tired of him."}

He watches this tape constantly, so I figured that the real show would be quite good too. The set from the first show is great! It is the \"old\" Stevie. Great songs, great sound quality. The second performance isn't as good. The songs were not as recognizable and the sound just wasn't that good. It was quite muffled actually! I'm not sure why the quality dropped off between the two shows but it was pretty distracting. My father and I watched the video together and both commented about how it didn't sound good. Maybe it was just the DVD I got."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I used to have this on VHS and was ecstatic when the DVD came out.  Although the VHS was itself not the entire show at Great Woods (which is what we really want), nonetheless, what we got was terrific.  But it's just a travesty what happened on the way to the DVD editing room.  It's all chopped up with interviews interrupting the solos, truncated and/or missing songs.  It's so irritating that I will never view it again.  Now, if this show (with Warren, Allen, Dickey, Greg, Marc, Butch and Jaimoe) were re-released without the horrible edits it would be a \"must have\".Until then - avoid it."}

By the way, the VHS tape can be copied to DVD, which I heartily recommend!"}

{"label": 6, "raw": "Mr. Taylor is a troubadour of the ages.  He and the artists he assembled for this production are nothing short of incredible as they hit every note with grace and craftsmanship.  The production quality approaches that of The Eagles \"Hell Freezes Over\" DVD, however, I still feel the Eagles hold the honor of producing the benchmark DVD to measure all other concert DVD videos by.  Nevertheless, this concert is a close second and will captivate any JT fan.  \"Shower the People\" actually brought a tear to my eye, sooo sweet! The sound quality of the DTS is exemplary and the DD 5.1 holds its own.  The camera work is right on the mark and the quality of the video is crystal clear.

Few artists touch a certain part of your soul, in a way that he does. Honesty, complete sincerity, the open road of the free free highway, endless miles of wheatfields and prairies. A friend you can always count on.This concert, is a superb example, of what James Taylor is to all of us.He is a national treasure."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Celine Dion is definitely the biggest highlight from the first ever Divas Live. Her solo performances of River Deep, Mountain High and My Heart Will Go On are impeccable. Everyone agrees that her My Heart Will Go On performance on this show is one of her best and most memorable yet. She also does The Reason with Carole King. Shania Twain performing Man!I Feel Like A Woman! and You're Still The One also contributes to making this show better than it would have been with incredibly mediocre Gloria Estefan, incredibly annoying Mariah Carey, and incredibly over hyped Aretha Franklin. MARIAH CAREY IS NOT A GREAT SINGER!!!!!!!!It was awesome to see Celine rightfully upstage Aretha in the finale. Classic. Aretha may be the Queen Of Soul(ick) but Celine Dion is the Queen of ALL singers! The Canadians rule the day here, folks!"}

The music was wonderful, but the productions were terrible.  To me it took on the look of one big strobe light!  There were so many flashing lights in the backgrounds, foregrounds, above, below, from helicopters that most of the images were washed out and appeared overexposed and ghost-like.  Certainly not flattering to someone as attractive as Gloria.  Too bad, but this one is going to be discarded.

The DVD does not contain chapters or extras, which I'll admit is kind of a drag.  You have to start it at the  beginning and just watch it.  But upon watching it, you find Pearl Jam  lightening up and making music with smiles on their faces as they perform.  It's a great film which inspires me, as a musician, to play and write  better and love what I do."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wow, this performance by Alice In Chains blew me away.  It was their first live show in almost 3 years and while watching the DVD you can just tell that they really did love performing.  Layne Staley was one of the greatest vocalists of all time, when he sings you can feel the emotion.  Jerry is an amazing and underated guitar player, he has a beautiful voice as well.  This show is a little sad though, the atmosphere on most of the unplugged shows are very moody.  This DVD rocks and AIC set a standard for modern rock/alternative.  My favorites are \"Heaven Beside You\" and the unreleased song \"The Killer Is Me\"... it has an amazing chorus and guitar riff.  If you like AIC, this is highly recomended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Since I became a fan of Alice in Chains shortly AFTER Layne had died I was pretty much screwed in hearing or even seeing him perform. But after I spotted this sweet DVD hiding in a music store I just couldn't resist buying this to see Alice in Chains acoustic. Oh sure it might not have any power but by making there songs acoustic I could feel the powerful emotions running from this concert. Starting from Nutshell all the way to Killer is Me. There were some songs that were great but the way I see it is the exceptional ones are Brother, Would, Rooster, Sludge Factory and Frogs. Especially Would? because when I saw and heard this song I was remembering how strong he used to be and I saw him struggling...Overall this CD is AWESOME"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Being a casual fan of Alice in Chains and a major fan of grunge, I bought this DVD on a bit of a whim, not really knowing what to expect. Let me just tell you I was blown away.Listening to their other songs, I can say that the unplugged renditions they give here are their best ever. For all their musical talent, some of their production sometimes seemed to be lacking, with either the vocals or instruments being drowned out. In this performance, everything seems to blend together so perfectly it seems odd to hear the non-acoustic versions of these songs.If you were thinking about getting one of their CDs, I suggest you try this DVD first. Skip the CD version of this album, because actually seeing them perform completely changes the experience. Now, 2 years after the death of Layne Staley, this beautiful music is more important than ever."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Which isn't on this collection, but then some  songs wouldn't translate to an unplugged perfomance.  The most amazing contradiction to this was \"Would?\", which absolutely rocks both on Dirt and on this DVD!.  All songs are great, though you can see Layne fading away and screwing the the lyrics on \"Sludge Factory\".  Layne, RIP.  Jerry Cantrell is the leader of this group that by this time had Mike Inez as the bass player.  Who's the drummer again?  My wife says he's one of the best drummers around.  What does she know???  Yeah, ok, he's good.  This DVD rocks, its a must have, even if you aren't a metal head.  what the hell is a metal head anyway?  This is just damn good music...  Oh yeah, I forgot, I'm a metal head."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The title of this review, of course, is to reference the messsage bassist Sean Kinney wrote to four patrons of their MTV Unplugged set, Metallica. That is one of the many highlights, humorous and saddening,that you will find on this DVD. Of course, as mentioned may times over, the obvious fact is the deterioration of Layne Staley. The man was clearly on his last legs; the power and conviction in his voice is all but gone, and what is left is essentially a mouse-like figure, trembling and quivering his own shame and sorrow. Perhaps, at least for this performance,is for the best; the changes underscore the gravity and moxy that this band once had. \"Would\", \"Down In A Hole\" \"Rooster\" and \"Killer Is Me\" are some of the better performances that are featured is this must-own DVD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been listening to these boys for years but honestly I had never seen them.  To see them doing many of their hits live was more of a thrill than I had imagined.  They are so talented and quite a charasmatic presense on stage.  Jerry and Layne harmonize together flawlessly.  The drums on &quot;No Excuses&quot; are perfect as well as the opening bass line for &quot;Would?&quot;It is sad in a sense to watch Layne because of his untimely death but his creative talents will live forever in this concert.Many times in the concert the band members talk to the audience and as I said before many of their best songs are played.This is a must for ANY Alice in Chains fan."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I had the pleasure of seeing AIC on tour with Van Hagar (Halen) in 1991. They blew Van Hagar's door's off! Their shear talent, energy and musicianship were totally inspiring. I went there to see Van Hagar and emerged a lifetime AIC fan. No one has ever better coupled together brooding rock melody with power-chord virtuosity than AIC. Sadly, no one now will. Layne was a one-of-a-kind vocalist, both inspired and tormented by his inner demons and probably, like Cobain before him, hopelessly destined for his ultimate fate. Jerry continues to play and record admirably, but a major piece of him obviously died that fateful day in 2002.It is disconcerting that there are currently so many AIC-derivative bands making a shameless living off of unconvincingly replicating AIC's sound. Inspiration is one thing; sheer plagerism is quite another. Good luck, Jerry; R.I.P. Layne."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I love Alice in Chains.  I literally grew up on them.  This show just captures the essence of what Alice IS, to be honest.  Layne's little blooper on 'Sludge Factory' was a nice reminder that celebs are people, too, they're not perfect.  And I'm not one to cry at songs...but 'Nutshell' had me sobbing almost immediately.  If you don't have this DVD, you're really missing out.  It's probably my favorite DVD of all time."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a moving performance by a severely underrated band. I didn't really start to appreciate AIC until the last few years. This is a great bare bones performance of AIC playing their most important songs. This is a testament to the bands incredible power.The crowning point of this video for me was the performance of \"Down in a Hole\". This is a very intense song that seems to eulogize the life of Lane Staley.If you are like me you will find this video so enjoyable to watch that you will likely watch it often. This video will change the way you look at everything."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "January 1st, 2006Every New Year's Day when I view this superb DVD of the VPO and Karajan at their most musicianly ways, I am impressed by the ebb, flow, and hesitancy which is the way the music of the Strausses should be played.A conductor friend of mine who studied in Vienna and was conductor of an orchestra in Lvov said that Karajan and the VPO in this recording got it RIGHT!Especially entrancing is the music accompanying the horses from the Spanish Riding School and Karjan's darling, Kathleen Battle, doing a fine rendition of the Voices of Spring.The stage is sumptuously decked out in what seem to be all of the fresh flowers in Vienna and one gets the sense that this was a real event because the maestro died only two years later.I highly recommend this DVD and it will give YOUR New Year's Day something special to remember it by.Timothy Wingate  OTTAWA  CANADA"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Many critics find the CD of this performance to be one of Karajan's worst, but I fail to fathom why.  Perhaps having the visual as well as aural changes the perception.  This is a stunning work.  The choral arrangements  are the strongest I have ever heard, not watered down like on Norrington's  9th.  Being able to see the singers makes the perception that much better.  I hope that in the future all classical music is recorded in this format.  It could certainly help pick up the lagging sales in the market.  It could  also revolutionize pop recordings, as artists could release an audio album  complete with accompanying videos.  This is where the Sony/Philips SACD  could really make an impact: artists could release a single disc which  would allow CD play of the music in cars, on portable stereos, etc., and  also allow audio and video in a home theater system.  Let's hope the  industry catches on!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Overall the sound and image quality of this DVD is OK but I am still quite disappointed by this release particularly the 4th movement &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;.  This performance is definitely worse than  the one recorded by Karajan in 1970's and may be not as good as that recorded in 1960's.  The tenor and baritone here are extremely weak and it feels like that they are singing serenade instead, which makes Beethoven's 9th symphony lack of strength.  Karajan's 1970's version of this work is the best and I wonder why he did not try to find someone as good as Peter Schreier and Jose van Dam.  Anyway, this release is still worth collecting since it's the only one on DVD.  Not too many choices."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Finally I bought this Karajan's last Beethoven's symphony cycle on DVDs and it was really exciting to take a close look at the conductor and orchestra while they were playing.  The orchestra and chorus are just excellent - exactly what I expected since I have their 1970s performance on CDs.  However, I am still quite disappointed by the 4th movement of the 9th Symphony because of the girly voices of the tenor and baritone, although the soprano and alto are brilliant.  Each time when I was watching this one, I had to be away from TV and speakers to avoid listening to tenor and baritone singing.  Anyway, it's still worth buying since I cannot expect another DVD from Karajan.  My rating for this symphony cycle is 5 stars for Symphonies nos. 1 - 6 &amp; 8, 4 stars for the 7th and 3 stars for the 9th.  The sound quality of this DVD is not as good as on CD but it's not a problem when turning the speakers louder."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "With so many versions of Vivaldi's Four Seasons, and after listening them so many times, I asked myself if it's something I still don't know or heard. This version gave me the answer. Compared with this version, the  others seem weak, superflous, ambiance music to entertain bored monarchs.  With Karajan and Ann-Sophie Mutter, Vivaldi regains power, character and  now is music to be listened with attention to all the interesting details  that make this version the best one I ever heard. Listen (and see) the  violas in Summer's 3rd, the powerful bass in Autum 3rd while Karajan,  sitting by an extra cembalo, improvises some chords. A must-have for all  music lovers."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have heard many fine four seasons and this one does not stand out. I still think the performance with Gerald Scwartz on the Delos label with the Seattle Symphony is more lush with better sound. The reason to get this on DVD is to actually see the performance. Yes we do get to see it.....but not very well. The video is quite poor which is perplexing since it is only 20 years ago. The other problem is the concert is only 45 minutes long which is chintzy.

I mean they still haven't released The First Vision on dvd yet I don't think they ever will.  This concert has so much bad editing.  Let her sing one song all the way through at least once.  The only reason I gave this dvd five stars is because of the exclusive music videos.  The Roof and Breakdown are classic.  Swimming with the dolphins was also very cute."}

The only thing I didnt like was when i selected \"play all videos\", for some reason it didnt play Valentine Girl. It was like it wasnt even on the dvd. It just skipped right over it. Maybe it had something to do with my dvd player, i dont know. But overall i love it :) and my 8 year old brother was dancing to it and watched it with me. He doesnt even know who they are and he loved it hahaha :)"}

She wants to watch it over and over.  Her 4 year old cousin wants to watch it whenever he comes to visit.It's fun enough that you don't mind watching it over and over again.  John Stewart and David Alan Grier are hilarious and the music is great.  The only part that I don't particularly care for is Rosie O'Donnell, but that's just because I don't like her.Buy it for your kids.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a fabulous and funny musical tribute to Sesame Street.  It is a great variety show (a la Muppet Show) which is a plus.  Jon Stewart plays a great part of the would-be show host that gets locked in his dressing room.  Elmo is prevalent, but not as much as the title would suggest.  I don't believe that it is enough to give it disparaging marks!(For those of you who are hung up on Elmo, check out Elmo in Grouchland!)Rosie, Shawn and all of the stars are gregarious and wonderful for children to watch.  In fact, it is a video that I enjiy watching with or without my children!!!5 stars!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "...we also agree that Rosie is a bit toooo much for this prime time Sesame Street outing, but, that's okay because, things like Chris Rock bantering with Oscar the Grouch, and the Fugees jamming with Big Bird and the Mayor of Margaritaville literally kickin' it with Kermit and the Amphibians, and tunes from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and Shawn Colvin (not to mention  Muppets' two straight men in this, the sardonic Jon Stewart and the always funny David Alan Grier) makes this a show that most parents and grand parents don't mind watching with the youngsters....a musical, magical 55 minutes of fun."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "He's proven time and again that he is open-minded and holds open arms to new music and performers.  These are the characteristics that have kept this fine artist popular for over 50 years.  We always look forward with great anticipation to his new projects.  He constantly gives his best to his audiences, and the love and respect are repaid by audiences of all ages.  With this album, we all receive a gift of being exposed to at least one performer we hadn't been familiar with before.  How wonderful that Tony keeps us growing and therefore, knowing the joy and pleasure of great music."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It is really the politics of mass rock concerts that is on center stage in this film.  The locals on the island are revealed to be completely out of touch right wing nuts.  And large elements of the crowd become organized into left-wing activism against the seemingly inept and exploitive capitalists running the concert.  The whole thing degenerates into a kind of Monty Python skit on early 70s politics -- accompanied by wonderful music.  Not only does this film have performances by great musicians of the era, including Jimi Hendrix (his next to last performance before he died), Miles Davis, the Doors, Joni Mitchell and John Sebastian.  It also has performances from groups who were big at the time but are now largely forgotten such as Ten Years After."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I could go on and on, but briefly - if you are a filmmaker and you spend 100 times more time in your film showing gatecrashers throwing rocks at a tin wall than you do Miles Davis fronting one of the greatest jazz bands of all time, or Jim Morrison or Jimi Hendrix giving their last performances, than you are an idiot. This film is an agony to watch for any true music lover. Also, one last word folks (and this is true for Altamont too), don't judge the motives of the entire love and peace generation by the results of an incompetently organized rock event. As Seth and Amy would say, \"Really!\""}

The isle of Wight was more for the money than Woodstock. Some were kept out even if only one outta then of the crowd payed. We don't get the feeling that we're there with them as in Woodstock and the footage isn't as good but it is enjoyable, you can see some great performance, especially from Pete Townshend. If you don't have seen Woodstock, see this one first and then Woodstock, better keep the best for the end."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I own many of John Denver's music is 33 record form.  He has been one on my personal favorites for many years.  He has such a melodic and warm voice.  It's always a pleasure to listen to his music.  This Wildlife concert was to highlight his music and his love and interest in the environment.  Between every few songs John stops singing and talks about his inspiration for why he wrote a particular song.  I didn't find it distracting since many of John songs he wrote himself.  It's nice to hear the background.This DVD has beautifully clear video and sound.  The concert runs almost 2 hours (113min) of pure enjoyment for John Denver fans."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was one of the most enjoyable concerts (other than \"live\" shows I attended) I had ever seen John do... he was himself, he was in top form, he still captivated the viewer and entertained with such ease...John Denver is an American Classic -- and is missed a great deal.Thank you, John - for all you did, all you tried to do and all that you were.  You will remain with me as a beacon of hope and will shine on forever....~~~~~\"Though the singer is silent, there still is the truth of the song\" -- John Denver"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "John Denver's voice got better and better with time and it shows in his Wildlife concert. John's voice, music and lyrics take me to a unique place where no other singer or music can take me where there is peace, reflection, love for nature and life and all the best of it. His music is timeless; you can appreciate his voice and all the instruments unlike much of today's music where there is a lot of noise and you cannot fully hear and appreciate the voice, the lyrics and the instruments. Nothing like an acoustic concert like The Wildlife Concert to really appreciate and understand what real good music is. John Denver left a wonderful legacy with his music and his work; he was not only a great singer, musician and songwriter but also an environmentalist who was and will continue to be an inspiration to many."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "There were so many songs on this that I'd never heard. John looks a little older but sweeter too. I just loved it all the way through. To me, he was a true genius at song writing. And, bless his heart, you could understand every word he said. Not like the noise they call music now where you have no idea what they are saying.  He was a national treasure and died too young. I am so glad that I was able to see him in concert in Fort Worth,Texas many years ago, probably in the mid 80s. It was wonderful. Of course he had lived here at one time and made jokes about meeting old high school friends again.  My other favorite is \"A Song's Best Friend\" which I've seen on PBS and now own a copy of."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Over the years, I have purchased most of John Denver's LPs and then CDs, and also observed several of his performances on television. (Regrettably, I was never in the audience at one of his concerts.) Recently I saw the PBS program during which the program on this DVD was recorded over a two-day period. Denver has never sounded better nor seemed happier than he does during The WILDLife Concert, totally comfortable playing a rich and diverse selection of older and newer songs. How rare and commendable that he makes each of the 25 seem so fresh. He is joined by immensely talented associates, notably James Burton, Jim Horn, and Pete Huttinger. FYI, this DVD and its companion two-disc CD include the previously unreleased \"For You\" which is not available elsewhere. I lack the talent to express how much I admire and will miss this talented and good man."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "I had to give this 5 stars, I mean it is NIN and all of their awesome videos are on one of the tapes! This 2 tape set (depending on which tape you view first) starts with videos for Head Like a Hole (classic NIN) Wish, Happiness in Slavery (certainly NOT for the squeamish) March of the Pigs, Gave Up (featuring Marilyn Manson and filmed at the Sharon Tate house) to the 2 most brilliant works of art in music video: Closer and The Perfect Drug. The second tape includes concert footage and backstage happenings with Marilyn Manson, David Bowie and the Jim Rose Circus. I only wished that it had more of the backstage stuff and that the filming wasn't so distorted in parts, but Trent will do as he will and we will love it!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you love Nine inch nails but never got to see them live, Closure is the next best thing. The first video is interviews of fans and band members, Lots of live preformances, and trent beating the [heck] out of the drummer by violently throughing mic stands at him. Its a great video because you get to see the pure power and intesity of the band live. The second video is the collection of videos up though broken. You get to see never before seen vids of \"help me I'm in hell\" and \"happiness in slavary\"(keep the kids away form the tv on that one. You'll understand once you see it)Plus the high lights of their live shows. Its fun to watch and see the way everyone acts back stage. Pick it up. You'll like it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I see that the reviewer below hasn't heard the news. Trent has planned on releasing this on DVD. There was some protesting from his ex-manager about it, but now that the battle in court is over, Trent can re-release this. The DVD should be out before too long, so anyone planning on buying this version should wait. It's rumored that the DVD version will include the Broken movie and the videos he's released since the VHS of Closure. Until then, you can watch most of the songs on NIN.com, albeit with crappy quality."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "THat is a line from march of the pigs song/ video. THis closure set is the best. It has all the videos that were released from nin's beginning until the release of the downward spiral. It  also has live footage from the self-destruct tour from 1995. The concert kind of blows but the videos are awesome. BUT BEWARE THE VIDEOS ARE EXTREMELY GRAPHIC AND DISTURBING. THEY ARE VIOLENT BUT GOOD. This is only out on VHS right now because trent is dealing with law suits for the release on dvd. Don't wait. It won't come out. BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "a personal look at what went on backstage at NIN's self-destruct tour. although not as huge a NIN fan as I once was, I've probably watched this set at least a hundred times, and I continue to watch it on occaission just because it truly captures the band at their best. the live performances are so perfectly sloppy and intense... the shabby film quality in parts fits the music and the images so well it is hard to desribe. the whole thing just seems so natural. the second video featuring the actual music videos for NIN's songs are wonderful as well, in particular, the video for GAVE UP. this video, which simply depicts the band plus marilyn manson recording the song in the studio, is my favorite for some reason. maybe just because it humanizes the artists and shows where the music actually comes from."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "NIN MUST HAVE: inside you will find two videos, unlabeled. one is the entire music video list (with the exception of ones made in the last five years) and the other simply footage. actually there is nothing simple about it and i have heard it called vulgar before.  However I do not agree.  It is full of on stage, behind the scenes footage that is to die for.  Definitely a must for all NIN fans, and a great, really, introduction to the guys.  My favorite piece of NIN paraphilia next to And all that could have been the vid and, in the same edition, the 2 cds- and all that could have been."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've had this since the day it was released and it just doesn't get old. One video includes all the bands videos up through Perfect Drug (including the controversial Happiness in Slavery video!). The 2nd video is filled with live material and backstage footage. If you're a big NIN fan like me you should love these vids. I only gave this 4/5 stars because the quality of the live material isn't as good as it could have been (but its still good and not bad by any means). This video set was a great addition to my collection."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "'Closure' was the definitive Nine Inch Nails music video collection.  (It contains all the videos up to 'The Perfect Drug'.)  'Closure' is divided into two video cassettes (unfortunately it has not been reissued on DVD--yet).  The first video is their music video collection; the second, is footage from 'The Downward Spiral' tour.  The videos are arranged in chronological order.  The second video is about 90 minutes long, containing live footage from their tour.  Marilyn Manson and David Bowie appear on the footage.  It's priceless footage for anyone interested in trying to understand the enigmatic mastermind behind Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor.  'Closure' is a must-have for any avid Nine Inch Nails fan."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this CD for my baby daughter to try and help her fall asleep and it works wonderfully, she loves it!  The music is from all over the globe so there is a diverse range of sounds, but it is all pleasant.  I have listened to the CD over and over again and still I am not sick of it.  I also like the liner notes.  These songs are about such interesting things.  For instance one talks about children being afraid of foxes coming and another talks about how both the baby and the cat have golden cradles, but that the baby's is nicer.  I really recomend this CD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Conductor and composer John Rutter has been a fan of this work for a long time - and it shows.  The orchestra is simply excellent as are the Cambridge Singers.  Rutter chose to use two younger voices for the women's solo parts; the soprano was 29, the alto 25 when recorded.  The quality of voices changes over time and there are some solos that benefit from young voices and some that require mature voices - per the conductor's and listener's choices.  The tenor at times overdid the vibrato.  The solo voices were all excellent but sometimes they lacked the depth and power that more mature voices often offer.  Comments aside, this is a fine group of soloists.  The clarity and separation of the choral parts are excellent.  This is a medium-paced rendition which captures the emotions of the oratorio while not forgetting its baroque heritage.  This is one of my 9 recordings of the complete work and one you'll enjoy owning."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As a fan of Rutter and the Cambridge Singers, I knew their take on Handel's Messiah was a natural for me. Although the sound of the Cambridge Singers has changed over the years, it has never lost its distinctive hallmarks, as on this recording. Rutter has a first-class group of young soloists, and I especially like the soprano and bass soloists. I know that Melanie Marshall might not be able to touch Anne Sofie von Otter's renditions of the alto parts on Pinnock's DG recording, but she gives a truly heartbreaking account of He was despised. Throughout, the tempi is brisk and bright, but yet the performance bubbles with conviction and commitment. Rutter also shines as a choral conductor, eliciting a superb overall sound from his choir and crafting avery nuance intricately in the manner of Robert Shaw. I think this would probably be one of my top dogs for Messiah, alongside Pinnock, Gardiner and the live Cleobury-King's College version."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "What a concept: writing good songs. Too bad VH never got that memo before they churned our a Different Kind of TurdChickenfoot got the memo. There is killer music here, which is not even debatable and Satriani sounds just plain cool in most of the parts especially all these chunky Keith Richards riffs he seems to roll out. Then he whips into a lead like only Satch can do. Very cool stuff.Michael Anthony is more out front on this disc and he should be. Again, the VH record suffers without him, this one benefits tremendously by having him on it.Hagar's voice is still excellent and he still writes a decent melody unlike 'mumble with rocks in his mouth-Roth'.Anyway, Bigfoot is awesome, Alright alright, Dubai Blues is cool, Lighten Up, Up next, there is just some well written catchy music being played here by guys that are having fun together and it sounds like it. One of the best things you can pick up this year if you want some good rock!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is getting a little gimmicky - 3D glasses and images on the cover, 'Superband' status with all these big names - and nowhere near as powerful a return from the first album. It's an okay rock album, but something I cannot sit down and directly plug my ears and brain into. I have to have it as background noise while I am working. Don't get lost in the marketing gimmick of 'Hagar and Satriani', but still worth a shot if you have not heard the first Chickenfoot album. If you have heard the first album, don't get your hopes too high."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I notice there seems to still be this competition with some VH fans that won't die and never will so I thought I would put my two cents worth in here.I love the new Van Halen record ADKOT but that does not mean I am suppose to dislike this record like some people have decided, they are both great! I do favor the new VH more but that's not to say this is not an excellent record IT IS! I was and still am a fan of VH with DLR and Hagar and now Chickenfoot as well it's nice to have this much good RnR these days we should all feel blessed we do! By the way for young ones still learning Sammys music check out his fantastic solo record Standing Hampton."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is one of the best hard rock CDs I've heard in a very long time.Far better than the first disc.There is a version with a CD/DVD package, but I bought the CD only and found a serious rocker bonus track, not listed on the liner and from what I hear, NOT included if you buy the CD/DVD package.The band is very diverse on this with rockers, cranking hard rockers and some lighter rockers and ballads. Hagar is at the top of his game. Everyone is and standing out individually while creating an open quality band statement on each track.Three and half letters is a very powerful (words and music) rockin' piece.No Change, the unlisted bonus track just absolutely rocks full tilt.I've only heard the whole disc twice, but in will be my driving disc for a long time. I hope the radio catches on to this."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Sammy Hagar's been entertaining me since his &#34;Bad Motor Scooter&#34; days with Ronnie Montrose. Here he joins again with friends Joe Satriani, Michael Anthony and Chad Smith to produce a very current record. As a longtime fan, I'm not about to say I turned it up to ear-bleeding levels. But I could. The tunes rock consistently, and there aren't any flat spots. The music created by these veterans shows that they are truly monsters of rock and roll. And they're creative. Still. Master craftsmen."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Liked Sammy's work with Van Halen and selectively his solo stuff. Love most everything Satriani has put out. Feel indifferent about the other two band members. Liked 3-4 tracks off the first Chickenfoot album to keep me interested and they still make it into my workout set list every once in a while.... My kid gloves off review of this album is not too kind. I don't hear growth so much as regression. The best two tracks on the album are Different Devil and Up Next, everything else is throw away. Different Devil is good but it sounds like something off a Hagar solo record, Up Next is the only song that reminds me the guitarist behind this album is one of the best alive. Only problem with Up Next is that I really don't want to hear Hagar's vocals on this one because the lyrics just disappoint compared to that great guitar work.Oh well, maybe the next one will be better."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "chickenfoot 111 takes off where it last was with the first cd. I read that joe challenged sammy to sing like he never did before but I dont hear any change in his vocals not bad just no difference in his style and sammy did the same with joe to play things unexplored and i dont hear anything different but joe still is badd real badd plays his ass off so he's just fine. Chad and Mike are just fine as well but I don't like the lyrics(who writes them?) on some of the songs but overall great collection of songs.  I like song 11(they lied about this one they lied about that one)nice tune, bye yall"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Well thank God for Micheal Anthony and Sammy Hager! At least those two X Van Halen members are still making some decent sounding old school rock and roll. With Chad and Joe in the mix as well, it's gotta kick ass right? Well I'm happy to say that it does for the most part. You wont find any jaw dropping momemts here, but you will find great old school rock tunes. A pleasure to listen to and I'm glad Mikey and Sammy can still rock even at their age lol. Well done lads keep it up for as long as you can cause I'll keep buying if you're not dying!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I agree with quite a few others that almost all the songs here are generic sounding Sammy Hagar songs (maybe something solo).  Not even the great guitar player can save these songs.  The only song I like is the last one, Something Gone Wrong!  And that describes the rest of this CD for me.  I was really surprised by the first Chickenfoot CD, the songs were really catchy GREAT HOOKS that had you stompin your foot!  And I'm not even the biggest Hagar fan, I did like Montrose and selective Van Hagar!  But that first CD really nailed it and it was a surprise hit going GOLD!  I just dont see the same thing happening here, I dont think it's going to catch on like the first one!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Their are several excellent songs on this album! Myles Kennedy is coming into his own as a vocalist and Slash is still an awesome guitar player. He is experimental enough that you don't feel he is afraid of playing something new or different and yet at the same time he keeps the riffs flowing throughout the album! For me Your a Lie and Bad Rain are highlights but there are several others that rock and very few that do not! A very succesful effort that brings Slash out of the immense shadow of GnR!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Ghost of Guns N' Roses lives in this album if you listen carefully, in some cases Myles \" The Dying Cat\" tries to emulate Axl's style.Take a good listen and you'll find \"Locomotive\" riff from Use Your Illusion in \"Standing in the Sun\", \"Anything Goes\" from Appetite in \"Halo\" the chorus has some of Axl's style from \"Outta Get Me\", \"Move to The City\" is in \"Hard & Fast\" and the Chorus is very similar to \"Been There Lately\" From Slash's SnakepitGood album but sorry I cannot stand the annoying whining nasal singing from Myles..."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "Slash makes his solo return with his second album Apocalyptic Love. After listening to it a couple of times, i think that it is a nice upgrade from his solo debut. Apocalyptic Love has a more connected feel about it that better showcases Slash`s trademark no-fills rock along with fine support from Miles Kennedy and the Conspirators. Listening to the album, it is very obvious how well they have gelled together after a lot of touring in the last year.Overall i highly recommend Apocalyptic Love to anyone that loves no-fills, balls to the wall rock."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As in Slash is back! Been a big fan of Slash since the old GnR days...suffered thru the first solo album, and endured all the nonsense with Velvet Revolver and that arrogant jack-A Scott Weiland and his always being late to the shows...!!I waited to buy this album because the VR stuff, while good, never jumped out at me, it was missing something...BUT here it is! The song Anastasia is getting good rotation on Sirius Octane, and I was instantly hooked - because its the best guitar work Slash has done since GnR. As is this whole album. While Myles voice can a bit too high pitched at times - Slash makes up for it. Great guitar work all over this album and the band is a perfect compliment.I hope this is the beginning of more from Slash and these guys. I think he's hitting his stride here and I want more, and more and more..!If you like Slash and good old rockNroll - buy this album!"}

{"label": 6, "raw": "A rich, interesting, strong, and riveting album, \"Clockwork Angels\" has been approaching for a long time now, with its first two songs appearing many months ago, and the crazy-good \"Headlong Flight\" popping up as the true first single. There's so much here, I'm grateful for some early exposure. It was a great and welcome marketing move.The songs are all great, from the complex to the downright old school; it's a great blend. Geddy sounds great in voice and bass; Alex is flourishing a wicked guitar with taste and class; and Neil does everything right, with inventive driving rhythms and decorative percussion mixed in everywhere.What a great album! Thanks, gentlemen."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I had pretty much given up on Rush ever since their Grace Under Pressure album. Though there were a few songs I considered decent (Big Money and One Little Victory for example) the rest all seemed like filler music to me. But then Snakes & Arrows came out and I said to myself with much reserved, \"hey, maybe they have found inspiration again\". It was a pretty good album IMO. But with the arrival of Clockwork Angels I'm fully convinced that this band is serious about putting out the great music we all know these guys create. Snakes & Arrows was no fluke!Warning: This work is not for folks who need light Sunday listening music, Nickelback\\Foo Fighters generic rock or bubblegum pop. It's like sitting down to a steak dinner and a heavy dark porter. When you're done listening you'll know you've had one hell of a feast.I give this album a 4 out of 5 only because nobody believes 5 out of 5 reviews even though this is a 5 out of 5 album."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I saw Rush live on this tour. I've been listening to Rush and to classical music for over 35 years. I'm an avid classical music listener. Rush is one of my top favorite rock bands. I did NOT like the inclusion of a string section (violins, cellos, etc), classical music instruments, with Rush music. Many musicians believe that eclectic and creative mixes of musical instruments, genres and styles will produce great music.True. It does work many times. It did not work this time, in my very personal opinion and for my taste. The strings sound out of place and forced onto the Rush music and Geddy's singing. It sounds as if I were listening to Rush on one rock radio station and a classical music station was interfering with Rush. Five of the songs on this disc are performed with the Clockwork Angels String Ensemble. Otherwise, I'd give 5 stars."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The newest release from that trio up north is probably their best since \"Snakes and Arrows\". And yes, I know, \"Snakes and Arrows\" was their last studio release. My point is everything they make is great. Rush has such a unique sound that also appeals to a broad range of fans. I have been a fan since their release of 2112 and I have every album they have made except for a couple of their live releases. If you don't have this one yet, Rush out and get it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I won't breakdown and analyze each individual track but this album as a whole absolutely rocks! If you are a Rush \"fan\" and don't immediately love it, you should keep playing it - because Rush's musical brilliance is there if you are open-minded enough to really listen for it. If you are reading the reviews due to an indecision to buy Clockwork Angels...don't waste another day and just do it.I believe that most people that download and buy only single tracks are cheating themselves because you must listen to Clockwork Angels from start to finish. This is a concept style album which Rush fans have come to enjoy and this is no exception, so I strongly recommend having enough time to listen to Clockwork Angels in it's entirety. While most significant rock music artists of the last 40 years are \"nursing\" their careers with greatest hits tours and uninspiring new music, Rush hasn't lost their fire or creativity."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is probably 'RUSH's' best album since 'MOVING PICTURES'. The band plays this entire album in exact order on their brand new live Blu-Ray DTS-HD live concert titled appropriately 'Clockwork Angels Tour'. Since Rush performed the entire album 'MOVING PICTURES' on their previous live Blu-Ray DTS-HD live concert titled 'Rush Time Machine 2011- Live In Cleveland', I feel this has direct baring on how Rush feels about comparing 'Clockwork Angels' to 'Moving Pictures'. This was an appropriate release timing wise for their induction into The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame and very probably pushed voters on the fence to finally vote them in. If you are a Rush fan but like their early material better than stuff they released in 90s and early 2000s, this is DEFINITELY a CD you should purchase. See also 'Snakes And Arrows' previous release Special edition 5.1 multichannel version DVD for even more outstanding Rush material."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been a Rush fan forever. I have loved most of the stuff they have put out but always have found a few tracks to be duds on every recent release. Clockwork Angels has no duds. It is absolutely amazing beginning to end. It is the first RUSH album since Signals that I want to hear all of Live. I love everything thing about this album. I even like the muddy mix, flashy wiz kid studio production and the cover art. This is the album I have been waiting for! Thank you Neil, Alex and Geddy for making this fan a freaking happy one!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Long-time Rush fan here (30+ years), beginning with the first album and continuing on.  Regrettably, I have to say this release is GOD AWFUL.  It just goes from bad to worse.  For the life of me I cannot understand all of these high reviews.  For me, I find the songwriting to be extremely poor, not a memorable tune here.  The guitar work is unimaginative and very average.  I didn't dig Geddy's singing either -- he seems unable to write and deliver a good hook or melody.  The quality of the recording stinks too.  By today's standards (and those of yesteryear) this release is a complete an utter loser.Sorry guys, but this is THE WORST CD I have heard in years.  I want my money back!!!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It's Rush, it's brilliant. No more needs to be said-Except for one thing-For some reason, my copy is in a jewel case and not the digipak that every other copy of this album I've seen has been packaged in. You say, &#34;So what?&#34; Well, to a geek like me, that makes it some kind of &#34;One of a kind&#34; thingy. Is it a bootleg? I don't believe so-So, nanapoopoo stick your head in doodoo, mine is in a jewel case."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Disclosure: I'm one of those Rush fans that has enjoyed all of their albums, even the lighter, almost jazz-like offerings. I've enjoyed dropping the needle on each new album wondering what it would sound like.That said, most of us long-time Rush fans became fans around (if not exactly) \"2112.\" Those earlier albums defined the \"Rush sound\" that polarized music fans. For those of us who loved it, we fell hard. We ate up \"Farwell to Kings\", \"Permanent Waves\", \"2112\", and even \"Caress of Steel\" (which polarizes even Rush fans).\"Clockwork Angel\" is a return to those earlier albums. This album flat out rocks! If fact, most of these tracks would not be out of place in the Thrash Metal category. For me, it belongs square in the classic \"Rush Sound\" Prog-Rock category.Grade: A"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been a fan since 1978 when I first bought 2112 on vinyl.  I sort of lost interest after Moving Pictures with all the synths, but decided to buy tickets to their upcoming show in Baltimore.  I bought Clockwork Angels just to know the new stuff, not expecting much.  Well, I have to say, this is now my favorite Rush album.  Extremely heavy, this sounds like it could have been released between Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures, or even earlier!  Great arrangements, interesting lyrics, all around a powerhouse album.  If you are a Rush fan and are contemplating buying this, do it.  You will not be disappointed."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "This album absolutely blows away Snakes and Arrows. Not only do you have a jamming Rush but the melodic as well!! The song Headlong Fight is definitly the best song on the album. Probably one of the best songs that they put out in a while. The melodic side is back. The songs Halo Effect, The Wreckers and The Garden have an atmospheric sound that will send chills through you as you listen. There is not a bad song on the album, compared to finding a good song that will stick to you on Snakes and Arrows. They have come along way with their music. and hopefully they will make more! This CD gives me faith in the bands new music form again. I hope it continues. You can only Wish Them Well! See you at the show in Philly!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I heard this album in its entirety for the first time at my brother's Fourth of July party this year.  This album is another turn in a different direction for Rush.  This band keeps evolving musically seemingly with each album they put out, and Clockwork Angels is no exception.  Even in their late fifties and early sixties, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart keep on evolving and most important of all, keep on rocking.So far, this is a 4-star album, but I say \"so far\" because it seems that so many Rush albums grow on me over time.  Eventually I end up raising my rating of the album.  We'll see if it happens again with Clockwork Angels.I definitely plan to purchase this album soon, as I have all the Rush albums and want to add this to my collection."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This release is modern science looking out for us music lovers. As well, the great friendship thriving among these men have paved my road for a concert trip. I hope they play most of this album on their fall tour. New sounds abound from all three. BRAVO!...I should add that the lyrics are poetry and should be read. And for those that refuse, maybe a band-aid box would provide some entertainment, and I mean attainment. Sorry, it just seems that some humans are struggling and I don't mean to be cynical, I mean to just say....WAKE UP!!!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Guitar World named Rush and Van Halen the top 2 albums of 2012, and it's well deserved. (as much as I hate lists, this one I agree)This is pure Rush. It reminds me of classic Rush, it's like nothing has changed. It's a reminder of why we love Rush in the first place.Rush has continued to make great music after so many years with the same lineup, that's not easy for any band.I won't go into why this album is great as so many other reviewers have mentioned already.Just listen for yourself."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The problem with modern production techniques is they compress the dynamics, making everything loud; then they increase the volume past the technical limits of the CD. This is evident on the Clockwork Angels release, and there are many areas where it is impossible to hear the nuances of Neil Peart's drumming, to follow Geddy Lee's bass lines, or to tell just what exactly Alex Lifeson is doing on his guitar. The mix wasn't as bad as the original master of Vapor Trails, but it is clearly not as good as it should have been."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The band was in shambles after Test for Echo, due to Neil's losses. Their follow-up, Vapor Trails, showed a band struggling to remain a band. Vapor Trails was a tremendous letdown for a lot of fans, myself included, not to mention holding the award for probably one of the worst sounding albums ever released by a major label, but it contains a lot of passion. Snakes and Arrows has some great moments and a few decent tracks overall, but it falls flat as whole. With Clockwork Angels we see Rush back in full swing. They want it again and they're pushing themselves to be as good as they know they can: Solid playing at a very high level, complex and intricate arrangements that keep your attention, and a passion that shows they really want to make something great!We thank you! Can't wait to see it live!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I will leave a lengthier review to some other ardent Rush fans, though I have loved them since their start! This CD really grows on me and I have listened to it at least 50 times or more! The production and mix is far superior to any of their releases (IMO) since the mid 1980's! I am a huge fan of the classic Rush sound and &#34;A Farewell to Kings&#34; is my favorite Rush recording. But, I have to say, I would have to put &#34;Clockwork Angels&#34; next in in line followed by &#34;2112&#34;. That should say it all!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I really like this album! The band is very tight. Lots of change ups & tempo changes & some of the heaviest playing i have ever heard rush do. Yes it's a concept album but you can pick any song and just play it. musially i think it is the best album they have ever made. lyrically 2nd best. Under 2112 i would say this is there 2nd best album ever. They are just playing there guts out on this album.It's like there playing while the room is on fire around them. Because of the concept aspect of the album only lyrically it reminds me of 2112. Musically it reminds me of the albums counter parts or snakes & arrows on steroids. Geddy's voice sounds killer on this record & this album show's some of the best music Alex & Neil have ever done together. If you have ever liked just one song rush has done you will like this album."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Clockwork Angles has surpassed Moving Pictures as my favorite Rush album.  Every song on Clockwork Angels is rock solid.  When I listened to it for the first time, it sounded a bit noisy, but each time I put it on, it got better and better.  The last song, The Garden, is especially good.What these three gentlemen continue to produce never ceases to amaze me.  Their musicianship and lyrics are better than ever, but the thing I love the most about Rush is the sincerity that comes out in their music.  There's nothing artsy fartsy about these guys.  They are for real."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like most new Rush CDs, I had to listen to this several times before I could form an opinion.  This is a good Rush disc.  The music sounds great & there are many good songs.  Geddy's voice sounds more mature.  However, his vocals sound tired; that is the only way I can describe them.  While I am always happy to get new Rush material, I can't really point to a specific song/highlight on the disc.  There is just something about this disc that disappoints.  I can't put my finger on it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Yes, a little play on the name of the group - but if you are a fan of Rush, then this will be a welcome addition to your collection (as it is to mine).  Even after all this time, these guys still rock.  They have proven themselves to be world class musicians - tight music, tight lyrics - a tight band.People may think that they have outlived their usefulness - and if you think that, you could not be more wrong.  If it has been awhile since you have listened to Rush - by all means get this CD.  If you never heard of Rush (and you may not have) - again, get this CD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've had this cd since the day it was released. I've listened to it everyday since and it never gets old. The songs are solid, the playing is probably their best on record, it's an amazing cd. I could write a review of every song, but it's already been done. If you like old Rush, the 3 piece guitar band with the big sound, you'll love this cd. If you ever wondered how Rush would sound if they improvised rather than rehearsed every note to metronome perfection, you'll love this cd."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought the UK Fan Pack, which included the CD, a nice booklet on RUSH and key chain thanks to a friend stationed in the UK.I listened to the album several times end to end and it was like a journey, which made even more sense once I got the book of the same name.  The book is a good story of predetermined future and the search for an alternate version of what you were told your life was to be.  The album came alive after reading the book.  Several of the songs were good before and were made better with the inclusion of reading the novel.  The whole concept album became visual like the novel as I listened more and more to the CD.....which I listen to each day at work.I liked the album before the novel and now love it!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I totally respect RUSH, and love some of their stuff like HEMISPHERES, FAREWELL TO KINGS, 2112 and FLIGHT BY NIGHT...but, it's been a long time since the last great RUSH album, that maybe is COUNTERPARTS(1993)....Since TEST OR ECHO, i think RUSH is not so inspired anymore, especially Neil Peart's lyrics....they are REALLY dark now....as musicians, Neil, Geddy and Alex are monsters!!!! Can't remenber many bands as techinical as RUSH...but the songs are not inspired...in fact, since SIGNALS(1982), RUSH started to create music with a kind of POP heaviness...i will stick with their legendary classic stuff like CARESS OF STEEL, PERMANENT WAVES and MOVING PICTURES!!!!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have to admit it.  I didn't care for it much at all - and I am a pretty big Rush geek.  But I kept listening and found that it has grown on me.  I still think Geddy's singing is a bit stretched at times, and I would have enjoyed more solos from Alex.  But overall its a very, very solid concept album and I am very glad they went this route on this album.  Great story, great music, and a nice change of pace.Great work guys!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "there last one snakes and arrows & this album was to me are 2 pf there best album since presto.id say i love probably 10 of the 12 songs.at least 5 could be played live with there classic hits!gettys voice isnt what it use to be but his voice is mature and sounds great.great riffs,drums,bass and solid song writing.and to me i will be listening to it for years to come and proud to put next to prestoand it sounds like most people who dont like the album is because of the compression which i dont blame them.you shouldnt need an audiophile system to have it sound good!luckly my tube amp gives it that added analog sound.BUT if your judging the album quality by mp3s you must be shot in the HEAD!at once!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'm a big fan of Rush.....and this is a decent album.  However....i am REALLY getting annoyed with digital compressed recordings!  Younger folks will not understand my ramblings on this issue.....but if you grew up on analog recordings of your favorite music....you KNOW how much better it sounds. ALL music these days has the same compressed sound!  Go back and listen to your older recordings of Rush and Van Halen....or ANY other band from the analog era.  It sounds SO much more open and dynamic."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have not purchased the cd as of my review,but I have listened to all the song's numerous times on YouTube.This album is FANTASTIC..I still can't believe anyone would give this gem less than 4 stars..but everyone does have the right to their own opinion.But this is so good,just listen to the tune called The Wrecker..Turn it up,and close your eyes..It just sticks in my mind..I have been a big fan of Rush since the very beginning,and have seen them quite a few Tours,and hearing this great music on Clockwork Angels has me ready for another show..Just an incredible new cd from our friends from the North.."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I first saw Brian Regan on Comedy Central talking about simple things like IHOP and trifocals...absolutely hilarious. This is a very funny disk...especially the name and spelling bee bits. I really like this guy because he doesn't curse and he isn't dirty at all. Comedians these days think they have to be vulgar to be funny. In my opinion, vulgarity isn't funny at all; Profanity in comedy has been rubbed into the ground. It's annoying and a sign of a lack of creativity. Brian Regan is clean, ingenious and hilarious."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Can it get any better than this?  \"I submit that it CANNOT!\"  This guy is so hilarious.  My husband and I got this CD after cracking up at his stand up on Comedy Central.  Brian Regan is one of those comedians you love to see in clubs.  You leave reciting some of his stuff and begin to laugh with yourself just thinking about it.  Everything is clean and nonoffensive as someone else said, but to be honest, I didn't really think about that until reading their review.  But it's true, very much like Bill Cosby Himself.  Love it!  The only downside is with it being a CD, you can't see his facial expressions, which if you have seen him on TV, you know what I mean :)  I wish there was more of his stuff available."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "And even after you've memorized the routines you will listen again and still laugh until it hurts. Brian Regan is hilarious. I can remember about 15 years ago watching him on tv doing his 'watching fishing on tv' routine where he marvels that the shows have a writer: \"What's he have to write, 'Ooh, she's a beauty'.\" I love his material about growing up and especially when he was in school. Maybe my favorite line is about how he waited until the morning of to do his science project, putting dirt in a cup. The teacher then asks him to explain it: \"Well, its a cup . . . wih dirt in it. I call it 'cup of dirt'.\" Listen to Brian tell the story and deliver the line and you'll be hooked."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Having come of age in the 80s, I still list Sam Kinison as my favorite comedian.  Even so, now with a family of my own I welcome comedy that I don't have to hide from my daughters or cringe when they overhear.  Brian Regan is just such a comedian.  If you love comedy based on language (as opposed to stories, observations, etc.) then this album is also for you.  And, as a bonus, your children can listen to it along with you, with the strongest word used on the CD being \"hell.\""}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Well, I know I'm a little late to this CD (12 years) but I looked it up on Amazon after hearing the first selection on Laugh USA Sirius XM last week.  I listen to that station for some smiles and giggles when I'm driving.  Brian Regan came on talking about \"you too\" and \"take luck\" and I almost had to pull over to the side of the road.  I was laughing so hard it really was dangerous!So now I have the CD and I listen at home where it's much safer for everyone.  It's just hilarious, no two ways about it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Chris Rea is a musician's musician - in other words, musicians recognize him for much more than a few hit songs and a tasty slide guitar. He has the heart of an artist and something even more important - INTEGRITY. I have just received \"Blue Guitars\" and have barely had time to listen to but a few tracks. I began by watching the DVD which only whetted my appetite to immerse myself, over time, in the whole project. What is immediately apparent is that Rea has not shirked his responsibility to be true to his own musical vision and also to the expectation of his fans who have come to expect exemplarary musicianship as well as audio excellence. A sample if somewhat cursory listening has confirmed my suspicions. \"Blue Guitars\" is a work of mammoth proportions and emotional depth. I fully intend to update this review over time as I am sure this is a journey that is going to take a while."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I listen the entire new album of Chris Rea. I never hear a Chris Rea album before. This is an excepcional, complex & mesmerize album. This is the best album of this new century & one of the best blues album of all time. Eleven albums in one year !!! This is incredible. You must listen to it to believe it. The latin blues by English man sounds superior to the latin blues make for sud americans & spanish people. All the albums are great & sounds very very diferent. My favorites are: 60's & 70's, Chicago Blues,Electric Memphis Blues, Latin Blues & Ballads Blues. I recomend very much."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I didn't actually realise that this set came as a fairly sizeable book (duh!). Blue Guitars is a labour of love, and it shows. Rarely, if at all, have I known an artist to produce 11cd's of great songs. It's an interesting journey. The book, with it's paintings and an in -depth interview with Chris Rea, are almost a throwback to the old vinyl days of studying the album sleeve as you listen to the music. Rea's slide playing has never sounded better and his dark brown 'trombone ' of a voice carries you through the journey from the source of the blues through slavery, into the various manifestations of it up to the '60-70s. Great stuff.A minor point - The CD sleeves in the book are VERY FRAGILE so will not stand up to too much use."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I must admit to being a dedicated fan of Chris Rea for many years and had not heard anything from this group at all.  I came across the collection purely by chance and decided to give it a try.  It has three Cd's and two vinyl albums.  Have not heard the vinyl as yet but the first of the three cd's is instrumental and takes you back to an earlier time in rock where the feel of the beat and the sound was all important.  It is fantastic.  The next two cd's are a variety of rocky and bluesy tracks which are equally as good.  On top of that you have the bonus of being able to read this very good quality book.  A very good collection from quality muso's."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wow.  I just came across this CD for real cheap, and boy was I glad I got it.  I have listened to lots of blues players of different types, and the guitar of Albert King is amazing, especially on this disc.  I have his In Session CD live with SRV, which was a really strong CD, but this particular CD presents a better sound of his guitar, in my opinion.  It sounds sweeter, more well-rounded, powerful, diverse, and dead-on.  I really love Albert King's work, and I always wish songs like \"Blues Power\" and \"Blues at Sunrise\" were much much longer because this type of slower blues has the sweetest licks.  Get this CD.  It radiates such warm, positive energy."}

I often throw &quot;Doje Ling&quot; into the cd player when I've got a heavy day of deadlines before me. Works wonders. For those curious about meditation books, pick up, &quot;Meditation Made Easy&quot; by Lorin Roche. That and his and Camille Maurine's, &quot;Meditation Secrets for Women&quot; are the two absolute best books out there and complement &quot;Dorje Ling&quot; perfectly."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "Enya's richly chorded style has smitten me once again.  A little bit Gregorian, a lot Celtic, combined with a soft, well crafted execution, gives us a CD anyone can enjoy and relax with.  Enya performs all the instruments and vocals on the album.  Her vocal style is willowy and sweet, which blends with the synthesizer and piano accompaniment perfectly.This is great &quot;Hot Tub&quot; or massage music.  If you're not so lucky as to have both a tub and a masseuse available, just try a recliner with a glass of wine.  Enya has given us more great music, still with her unique perspective of flow and rhythm.  Her music remains timeless and fresh years after its release."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Ok, first off, Enya rocks.  If you don't know that already, go buy her compilation album, Paint the Sky with Stars.  It will enlighten you.  If you already know how good she is and you aren't desperate to buy everything she's ever done, there is something wrong with you.All right, so maybe Enya isn't for everyone.  But you will likely appreciate her if you have ever been truly moved by a dreamy piece of music.  She is soft, soulfull, and dynamic.  And yeah, so her music all sounds the same, but when it's so good, how can you complain?Highlights from The Memory of Trees include &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot;, and &quot;On My Way Home&quot;."}

Every song on this album is a delight to listen to. \"Once You Had Gold\" is a song I'm actually using in a fanfiction story I'm writing, and I hardly ever do \"songfics.\" But this song is so beautiful and poignant and angsty that it fits perfectly with the message I'm trying to get across.Other special favorites are the title song, Anywhere Is, Athar Ar Neamh, China Roses . . . Okay, let's just say the whole album is a classic!!! I'm not really into new age music, but Enya is different! You will not go wrong buying her albums, and especially this one is a must-have!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is not another lousy Celtic New Age album - it is a genuine piece of music, well written and performed with emotion. It never fails to send shivers up and down my spine for some reason... Ever since I heard Orinoco Flow Enya has cast her spell on me. She is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic. On this album every song is as perfect as it can get on a pop record, with melodies that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain. I have every Enya album to date, but this one seems to be particularly special. A must for any music lover!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "[One CD, with a running time of 44 minutes.] Ah...this wonderful CD shows off Enya's silky smooth voice. The eleven tunes are hauntingly beautiful. I won't try to categorize her music, it is simply too rich and complex.The paperwork includes the words to ten of the songs (The Memory of Trees is a musical number), and two nice color pictures of Enya. (I love extras!) So, if you like Enya's past hits, then I think that you will like this one as well. Buy it!"}

De hecho, podr&iacute;amos decir que  esta es una excelente elecci&oacute;n para adentrarse poco a poco al mundo sonoro  de Enya, ya que este disco resulta m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil de escuchar que sus  anteriores. Si lo que desea es tener un muestrario de lo mejor de esta  artista, probablemente le convenga m&aacute;s comprar el disco \"paint de sky with  stars\"; una recopilaci&oacute;n de lo mejor de sus cuatro discos."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I heard this CD at a friends and when track 4 Athear Neamh came all it was breathtaking.  The clarity of voice and the beautiful smoothness bluesy oboe-like flutey vocal range is gorgeous.  I mentioned it to my friend and she said this is her favorite Enya CD.  Admittedly I got the CD just for the one track and I'm not sorry.  This remains one of the best in my collection of great songs and I can record it alongside other greats e.g. Dean Martin or The Carpenters and Enya measures up.  My husband and I also picked out China Roses as a good track.  Rarely does one finds a CD where just the one astounding track is worth the price of an entire CD, but this is one of those jewels."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I started my Enya collection with The Celts, and quickly added Shepherd Moons and Watermark, and I really liked those.A few years later I got The Memory of Trees, and I was disappointed.  Although there were some good pieces on this, it really wasn't as good as those first three.  It seems that this just lacks originality.That might seem a bit unfair, because 'lack of originality' may be attributed primarily to my familiarity with Enya's music, so that anything she does is going to start sounding just like her previous work.  However, some of the selections on this release seemed weak.Another way of putting this is that this release was too commercial.  It just appeared to have been cranked out for the money."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Enya is in a class all by herself.  She envokes feelings and images that take you out of reality.  So many others have copied her sound (ala James Horner in TITANIC) that it's easy to see how much of an influence she has been.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a classic album.  From the emotional first track instrumental to the enchanting &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, Enya has created a pallete of wonderful pastimes and tragic metaphores here.  Yes, I would consider this pop/new age music.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  There are a number of people that don't like Enya.  There are jokes on South Park about her.  And that's good.  It shows how much of a musical force she is.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a good collection of material from a very important artist, who I hope will never give up her love of music."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been a fan of Enya's music ever since the release of her second  album Watermark and after listening to this particular offering, I can  safely say it is the most exquisite music I have ever heard.  The vocal  layering and music form an absolutely magical sound that is uniquely Enya's  own;  and in combination with Roma Ryan's poetic lyrics, this is definitely  a match made in musical heaven.  There are no misses here as every song can  stand on it's own merit.  If you enjoy Enya's music this is an absolute  must have for your collection.  She just keeps getting better...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought Flyleaf's CD over the weekend and just had to put up a comment about it.  I would not rate this CD my favorite that I have bought in the past year but I would certainly put it into the top, oh I don't know, 20.  It is a good CD having many good tracks on it, but listening to Fully Alive on the radio then buying the CD and listening to the entire CD, the CD was different than what I expected, so that could be altering my judgement on it.  There is a bit too much screaming on the first track and another on it, I don't remember which one.  Buy the CD because it is worth your money, just don't buy it because you really like Fully Alive because many of the songs on the CD are not like that song, they are a bit heavier than that.  A good CD overall and I will be buying their next CD coming out."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The CD itself is good, but not fantastic.  I just got back from seeing them play live, though, and whoa!  They played a small venue here and tore down the house.  They are extremely energetic, the music is crisp, and Lacey sounded (and looked) great.  I went because a friend of mine had an extra ticket, so I figured what the heck.  I was not disappointed.  The CD doesn't do the live show justice, and for that I give it 4 stars.  If they're coming to a place near you, though, definitely check them out."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like everyone else here, I heard \"I'm so sick\" on the radio and had to hear some more. Also like a lot of others, I agree that while \"I'm so sick\" is good, it's not Flyleaf's strongest song. There are suprises here that make you listen closely to every song, rather than losing strenth towards the end, like most CDs. Lacey has an unbelievable voice. Imagine the clarity of Avril Lavigne, the power of Christina Agulara, and the rapid pitch change of Kelly Clarkson, combined. But she's not just a combination of super singers, instead Lacey has a unique sound, very heartfelt, and at times even creepy.The musical part of the band is good too. A little on the slow side at times, and could definitely use some better drum work, but that can be left for future albums.I bought this CD based on one song, and wasn't disappointed. If you like hard rock, it's pretty hard not to like this."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I got the Flyleaf EP and after hearing that I wanted to get the CD. The songs are changed a lot from EP, but still good. At first they sounded worse since they had lot of added effects or such to the song. After getting use to them I ended up preferring the versions on this cd, but still would recommend for people who liked this cd (I would recommend even more if you sorta liked band) to get EP since it has different sound. The lyrics change a lot between some EP and normal versions off the songs, mainly I'm So Sick. The acoustics also change lyrics a bit, mainly Cassie. it's a good CD with lot of nice sounds, but many have a religious reference (some very directly)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I picked this up because the local radio station, 897powerfm.com, plays some of this bands songs on the air.  I LOVE this entire CD!  What GREAT vocals and lyrics!  I am a new fan of this band and I look forward to picking up their EP and future releases.The best way that I can think of to describe them is Broomtree vocals with Tree 63 or Benjamin Gate tunes.  The lead singer's voice is incredible, I admit that I like the fact that a woman can yell like that.This one is going on my MP3 player and on my review forum at [...]"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'm willing to admit \"Cassie\" is a decent song. However, the album as a whole I hope I never hear again. I had a friend who would play this cd while I was in the car so thankfully I never wasted money on it. Lacey's voice is powerful which is great but would sound a whole lot better if she didn't use it.A lot of reviews seem to praise the song \"I'm So Sick\". It uses a very simple, repetitive melody which some bands can pull off but it doesn't work here. The same four notes stick in my head for hours along with Lacey's whiny voice miraculously getting more and more annoying each time. It sickens me that so many other listeners think this is good music."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Flyleaf shows why they have consistency on the Billboard Album chart. Every song shows a passion that Lacey and the others have for the music. My favorites are \"All Around Me\" and \"Cassie\". I really love the acoustic version of \"Cassie\". Flyleaf displays their musical prowess by supplying acoustic versions of \"Fully Alive\", \"Red Sam\", \"Cassie\", \"I'm so sick\", and \"All around me\". If you haven't picked up this CD, pick it up. It is worth the money."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "My friend Melissa got me into Flyleaf just recently. Man have i been missing out!i absolutly love All Around Me and Sorrow, but the rest of the CD is worth a listen too. I also like There for you and Fully Alive. very powerful songs, with lyrics that arent just any old lyrics, you actually feel the emotions in these songs. Plus there are acoustic versions, a definete must.The dvd includes footage of the performances as well as the videos for I'M So Sick,Fully Alive and All Around Me. the videos are awesome. You like Flyleaf, get this!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've been a pan-head since album 1 and I've really enjoyed seeing how skillet has evolved over the years.  This is an excellent and rocking album, first and foremost, and the talent is undeniable.  Anyone who's familiar with Skillet won't deny their passion for God and the human race that He loves, so if you're Christian, don't be put off just because you don't hear \"God\" or \"Jesus\" in the songs.  Without having to say the words, God is there.  This album touches on relationships, person to person and God to man.  It's about reaching out, being there for someone or needing someone to be there for you.  It's about figuring out the hard stuff, finding hope, finding life.  I'm very impressed by this album, musically and spiritually.  I can't believe it would be a disappointment to anyone.  Happy listening! :)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This CD is fantastic.  I heard Rebirthing on the Gospel Channel and owned the CD within a week.  Naturally, I listened to Rebirthing until I couldn't take it anymore (which was quite a while).  Once I did, I realized, every track on this CD is worthy of the same airtime as Rebirthing.  I don't say that lightly.  I'm very stingy with my cash on CD's having grown up when they cost over $20 and all you got were 3 great songs.  Now I usually buy the download song for .88 cents rather than splurge on the entire CD.  Rebirthing made me buy the entire CD and I'm glad I did.  This music rocks."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "To get straight to the point, Comatose is probably Skillet's best album ever. Without hearing anything on this record before buying it, I was completely convinced that there was no way Comatose could come close to comparing to \"Collide\" ~ which I thought was even better than the outstanding record \"Alien Youth.\" Comatose is packed from start to finish with songs you probably won't ever skip. The tracks just rock my face off. I would rate this album 6 stars if I could. Its that good."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'll skip all the fancy jargon, and just say that this CD has FAR exceeded my expectations for the album. I've had every album Skillet has ever made, and overall this is my favorite. Glad they've brought a bit of keyboards back in on this one, and they let Ben run wild on guitar! Kid is talented. It's also got great lyrics that can appeal to the MTV crowd and still be uplifting and point to God. Do yourself a favor and buy the cd ASAP. This is the CD I'll be listening to for a month or so straight."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Most bands seem to peak with their first, second, maybe third album. Well, it took Skillet a decade (and I don't know how many albums later) to produce a truly great album. Here, finally, is the mature, creative, talented Skillet that's been waiting to bloom, separating them from the mass of mediocre Christian grunge-metal bands out there. Yes, this album is a little more polished and has greater pop-sensibility than their previous work, but it's entirely for the good. From beginning to end, this album does not disappoint. They truly should get mainstream play with this album. It's hard to pick favorite tracks, but I would point you to \"The Older I Get\" and \"Those Nights,\" plus, of course, the fantastic first single, \"Rebirthing.\""}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This CD is very well done, and I am very impressed...although, I am somewhat not a fan of this particular style of music, I love how artists are beginning to reach people where they are-Skillet is a perfect example of this....many people a huge fans of this style of music, however, some get tired of only hearing negative, un-christian messages, like myself....I quit listening to todays pop music because of the unclean words, and nasty messages that made my walk with CHrist even more difficult-now I can enjoy the style of music without having to mentally block out the nasty messages"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Chris Tomlin has this down to a science now; he gets the best of both worlds every time he releases an album. First off, he gets heavy radio play and secondly his songs are sung in churches by nearly every worship team in the U.S., thus CCLI royalties. He deserves every penny!In life we all want to make a difference. Musically, some do it better than others. Chris chose to worship the Lord though music, and it's obvious that he strives for His excellence. He succeeds, over and over again. Bottom line, Chris is the Keith Green of the 21st century.Full song by song review available at [...]"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was exploring whether any album could come close to In The Court of the Crimson King after being completely disillusioned by groups like Fever Tree following their similarly near-perfect 1st album.  Same with Led Zeppelin, but that's another story.Of course it is not as good but immediately following the Crimson King album in a party setting with the sub-woofer on, it flowed together quite well.  Now I have to go exploring further as I did with Quicksilver Messenger Service until I had 8 albums, to see if there's another group to collect and study.  It looks promising."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A very good attempt by King Crimson on this set, using new singer, future Asia singer John Wetton, which is also on bass. Well anyways, this whole album is pretty inspiring with beggining to the end concepts. Starting with the title track which really rocks after the first 3 to 4 minutes of cymbals and xylaphones. Book of Saturday a little soft pretty good as far as sound goes. Exile a little more into the prog. My favorite on this album Easy Money, a lot here sounding as it could have gone on Dark Side of the Moon, as they were working on Money at the time, just a kick a** rocking tune with a kick a** beat to it. Then you get back into prog again with The Talking Drum, and the reprisal of Larks' Tongue in Aspic. Just a really good beginner album for those who never listened King Crimson, but heard of them. I would also prefer Three of a Perfect Pair too, very good and trippy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The trouble with trying to remember why you liked something 40 years ago is the context of the time is missing. While sonically this reissue is fine the music itself doesn't stand up to the test of time very well and is the reason I give only 3 stars. Maybe its my fault for not trying to get a copy of the music before buying (my original album has been long lost to history) but it seems very dated. The music lacks coherence and a feeling that the sound has an overall goal or purpose. This could be just me and others who remember this album fondly may be very satisfied, but for me this was one I should have skipped."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Welcome to KC, Mr. Bruford and Mr. Muir! The sometimes harsh percussion excursions on this album make for a truly unique experience. This album stands alone in the entire catalogue of KC material. Nowhere else is the use of percussion so thouroughly investigated than on &quot;Larks' Tongues in Aspic.&quot; From the maddening shifts in ferocity in the title track to the Pink Floyd-ish &quot;Easy Money&quot;, the two percussionists take center stage. I truly wish that Jamie Muir would've stayed on just a bit longer with KC; the material on &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; seem eerily empty without his presence. Later in KC's exitence, when Pat Mostello joined the soon to depart Bill Bruford on drums (the &quot;Thrak&quot; LP), it seemed that indeed the members themselves yearned for the tight percussives of &quot;LTIA.&quot; The effort was too little, too late.Regardless, this album is possibly one of the best of the KC output. It is a must have."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The little chime sound you hear at the beginning is a kalimba, an african thumb piano. After being hypnotized by this you will then hear a very well played, quiet, fluttering violin (the sound of lark's tongues?)Don't turn  the volume up too loud here, because you will split your speakers when the  crescendo of acid guitars come wailing into your brain. This is music of a  sort you haven't heard, a classic example of acid rock, classical mixed  with rock, and some sophisticated noisy percussion and jazz thrown in. Hey,  relax, thats just the first track."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "So much of what is classfied as 'prog rock' is showing its age, and time has not been kind. This opus by the ever- mutable King Crimson only sounds better with the passage of time, and it's taken me years to fully appreciate what Fripp and co achieved with this unusual collection. For someone accustomed to the melodic progressions of Pink Floyd and (occasionally) Yes, LTIA came as a rude shock with its abrupt dynamic shifts and uneasy mixture of delicacy and brute force. This is 20th century contemporary music par excellence, and is undoubtedly an acquired taste. Stick with it, and approach without expectations. This is the greatest example of that much maligned and often misunderstood genre called 'Prog'"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "With completely new personnel (aside from founding member Robert Fripp), a new lyricist and a new attitude, King Crimson returned with a vengeance on this, their fifth U.S. album. Adopting a heavier, more streamlined approach, the Fripp/Wetton/Bruford/Cross/Muir line-up sizzles like a volcano ready to explode. Gone are the gentle cellos and woodwinds of the previous LP, Islands - replaced with Cross' searing violin, Muir's eccentric purcussion and Fripp sounding heavier than ever on guitar. The mellotron is understated, while Wetton's bass thunders and Bruford manages the syncopated arrangements beautifully on drums. Highlights include the title cut (parts one and two), Exiles and the plaintive Book Of Saturdays. This album is considered the strongest post-In The Court Of The Crimson King album by the band (and really can't be compared to that album, as this is basically a completely different band - with similarities in name only)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Simply, one of the top prog records of all time.  Hard to get into at first, but every listen penetrates your soul until you get fully addicted to one of the most gifted and original rocK groups of all time.  Specially  interesting to guitarrists, bassists and drummers. This line up can hardly  be any better in creativity and chops. Also recommended: Red, Starless and  Bible Black, and Discipline studio Cd's.  There is also a recent wonderful  live compilation called Cirkus."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "OK, Here's the rundown - LTiA1 is pretty cool, although it runs a bit too long in my opinion.  Book of Saturday is an agreeable little tune with very nice vocals.  Exiles will remind you of the first couple o' KC  albums.Easy Money is similar to &quot;Cat Food&quot; and &quot;Ladies of  the Road,&quot;  The Talking Drum is pretty much a complete waste of space,  and finally LTiA2 is one of the best rock and roll tunes in exsitence and  is pretty much worth the price of the CD alone.&quot;Red&quot;,  &quot;Discipline&quot;, and &quot;The ConstruKction of Light&quot; are all  better KC CD's, but if you're a fan this is definitely worth the purchase."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is one of King Crimson's classic albums from the 70's that included BillBruford from Yes and John Wetton who played for Family and Uriah Heep. I gotreally interested in King Crimson during my early college years, and had comeacross their double album \"A Young Person's Guide to King Crimson\" from 1976.The first two tracks, Larks' Tongue in Aspic, and Book of Saturday, are on thealbum,and really liked them. I therefore went and got the album and really likedit from beginning to end. And being a fan of John Wetton, it goes well withUriah Heep's Return to Fantasy. One of the most underrated bands of all timeand should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "After listening to &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; which i thought was very good and had many beautiful moments, i was disappointed by Larks in that overall it sounded very dry and dull.  I fail to see what KC was trying to do when they recorded this album.  I wish they would have said something about that in the newspaper clippings in the albums liner notes.  Until i hear something about their purpose behind this album  i cannot apreciate this album from the standpoint of a music fan, there is just no emotion like there is in a Yes or Beatles recording.  &quot;Book of Saturdays&quot; is an ok song and &quot;Larks..pt.1&quot; is slightly interesting, but other than that i'm sorry i got this cd."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The second great version of King Crimson.  They came out of the box strong here, all members contributing brilliantly in some relatively equivalent proportion.  Robert Fripp has characterized his intention on some of the pieces as wanting to combine the passion you hear in African-American music and in Jimi Hendrix with aspects of the European tradition (precision and symmetry in composition) ala Stravinsky - he and the band actually did that here.  Music doesn't get much better than this.Larks' Tongue 1 &amp; 2, and Easy Money, fit the bill I've just described.  They are crafted, played, and recorded brilliantly.  &quot;Talking Drum&quot; is an effective jam, a study in rhythm and dissonance.  &quot;Book of Saturdays&quot; and &quot;Exiles&quot; are vocal ballads - I can actually live without them.  But that doesn't diminish the album, which is a real undereheard classic."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Well worth it for people who like interesting rock music. A grower, it might take a few listens. Bruford left Yes to join crimson, it seems like a good move because he can show his talents more. Apparently this album was a bit of a nightmare to record. Larks part 2 rocks hard and the tune was used in a film.  There's lots of interesting pecussion tricks and good bass playing. Robert Fripp steals the show with his Easy Money guitar showcase. Some nice ballads and long instrumentals too. Worth getting. thank you"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The title of this review is a slight exaggeration, but nevertheless this album has a classical element to it. Violins take center stage here, and permeate throughout. This album is definitely an acquired taste; the songs have very complex structures and have to build momentum. In many ways, this album is very bold, in the form of being very different. The standout tracks are EXILES and LARKS TONGUES IN ASPIC PART 2. EASY MONEY is good too, and features great bass work. I recommend this album for those who want a very progressive sound, and appreciate something totally outside the box. The violin really carries this album. The second half of the album is unexpectedly heavier than the first half."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "LTIA was the first in a trilogy of albums in which Crimso was attempting to prove that they were the scariest, most intense band in the world.  They succeeded here, although I feel they truly upped the ante on the succeeding LPs, &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; and &quot;Red&quot;--most particularly the last-named record.LTIA Pt. 1, with its whisper-quiet intro and loud, dissonant middle section, declares this intention immediately.  &quot;Easy Money&quot; proves it further, especially with the evil canned laughter at the end.  &quot;Book of Saturday&quot; is a lovely, abstractly despairing track.  The whole album is mesmerizing, and for me, LTIA, S&amp;BB and Red represent the best period in the group's choppy history, especially after the near-misses of ITWOP, Lizard and Islands."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like the other Crimson reissues, this hits the mark perfectly. There really isn't more you could ask for. You get a remixed album, bonus tracks, original mix, DVD-Audio, audio DVD-Video and video. Again, the content on the DVD seems to go on forever and I still haven't finished exploring.  Having both formats is good because almost no-one has DVD-Audio, although it's obviously great if you do - I don't, sadly. Steve Wilson does a great job with this project, an album often upheld as the band's finest hour.  I like many of the early albums but I also get why it's so esteemed.  First impressions of the 5.1 mix are that it's fantastic, although I know that this is a matter of opinion in most cases. Crimson fans need it, casual listeners should get a single disc version."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Was not expecting to really like this as well as I did, but it was definitely Elvis at his gospel best.  I would prefer to listen to the CD's rather the DVD as you get pure music all the way through.  The DVD has a lot of talking and only part of each song which drives a person crazy trying to listen to it.  CD is very relaxing and has all the favorites - How Great Thou Art, I Believe, Peace in the Valley, American Trilogy, Bridge Over Troubled Water, Amazing Grace, In the Garden, Precious Lord, etc.  Would highly recommend these two CD's."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Once Shatner's Capt. Kirk character was described as 'a swaggering dictatorial braggart with delusions of godhood.?  That pretty much describes the performances on this CD! If you love the 'Golden Throats' type of comedy albums that weren't originally intended to be funny as they obviously are now, this is probably as good as it gets. Speaking of things that are unintentionally hilarious, given the ridiculous prices some people think they can get for a used copy, this CD just SCREEMS to be reissued.  Until then, if someone offers a used copy at a reasonable price, who knows, someone out here may actually buy it!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I would give this five stars, but I can't in good concience. Venturing further into space than he ever did on star trek, shatner creates one of the all time best comedy/party albums.actually, the orchestral music is pretty clever throughout, and the rearrangements, while as cheesy as cheesy can get, are at least DIFFERENT sort of reinterpetation. it never gets old to hear shatner beller \"ONCE MORE INTO THE BREACH DEAR FRIENDS!\" as he misinterpets and misreads shakespeare.i just bought this today actually: i had a burned copy for awhile, but i saw this and had to buy. A must for fans of campy stupid crap, also a must for people who love shatner for all his talent and foibles. he has talent, i guess."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Here on CD we have the \"legendary\" album by William Shatner.  You may have heard his ridiculous renditions of \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\" and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" on theGolden Throatsalbum.  Actually, both of those songs are excerpts of medleys, with \"Lucy\" being paired with a monologue fromCyrano de Bergerac, and \"Tambourine Man\" being paired with an obscure poem called \"Spleen\".  See, the idea was to show Shatner's acting range by having him play two different emotions on the same track.  Of course, this being Bill Shatner, he overacts every emotion.  This is a terrible album, but it is the Holy Grail for collectors of bad celebrity recordings."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Shatner has said he knew he was being absurd when he made this, but I don't believe it for a second. I am convinced he thought he was being suave and interesting when he made this. Well, this is why IT IS so fantastic. It's the corniest record an actor ever made. When I first heard Mr. Tamborine Man I laughed long and hard...especially at the end when he screams so dramatically.Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds features Shatner sounding pained with indigestion, or drunk, as he delivers the lyrics to the Beatle classic. You can hear him smiling to himself in &quot;It was a very good year.&quot;Shatner doesn't sing so much as speak the lyrics to the songs he covers just like with the recent Best Buy commercials. Anyway, this would be a great &quot;bad&quot; gift to give someone. Shatner!! ...What a bloated cornball."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Borrowing a term Maddox once used, this album is an aural holocaust. The reason to buy this is to laugh at how terrible it is. While other more musically talented men avoided the problems of turning such classic rock songs as \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" into spoken word, Shatner attacked them...and then failed miserably. Surprisingly his music is possibly even more overdramatized than his acting and has unnatural melody-killing pauses for effect embedded throughout each song. It prevents casual listening or just enjoyable listening other than for comedic purposes."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I love this album, but from a purely technical perspective I have to admit it lies somewhere in between spoken word, a vegas cover act, and torture. It's awful, but hysterically awful.Shatner can't sing either. However, like Plan 9 from Outer Space, it's so nonsensical, it borders on great. I mean really, who thought setting up the theme from Cyrano and Mr. Tambourine Man as a medley was a good idea? His Mr. Tambourine Man is the most hysterically awful cover. Ever. The arrangement sounds like Mr. Tambourine Man does broadway, constipated.Spend the dollar."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Captain Kirk not only saves entire galaxies while impressing buxom beauties, but also manages to bare his soul in the most extraordinary collection of song and poetry the universe has ever seen. I dare you not to cry at the aching despair of \"Spleen.\" It's okay, let it out, because in a few moments you will rejoice with sheer exuberance to the strains of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" Captain Kirk truly makes this psychedelic gem his own. I personally wish he would cover every Beatles song, because only with his magic touch could they achieve greatness.Bob Dylan and Shakespeare also benefit from the genius of Kirk, as do many others. I'll be honest. I actually feel my I.Q. soar to superhuman levels when I listen to this disc. You owe it to yourself and society to bring this glorious masterpiece into your life. Under the guidance of the Captain, you too will be... TRANSFORMED!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Much debate has stemmed from this album - was Shatner playing a great practical joke on his fans or was he actually serious in reinterpreting the pop hits of the day to get his credentials in the Peace & Love Generation? Either way this is hilarious, and manages to be my favorite outsider recording aside from The Shaggs' \"Philosophy of the World\". Shatner's stone-cold emotionless renditions of \"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds\" and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" are cult favorites for good reason, and remain the most popular tracks off this album. However, the rest of the LP is just as classic. The good thing about William Shatner is that nowadays he realizes he IS William Shatner, and can look back at this ablum and enjoy it (I have yet to hear his new recording \"Has Been\"). One of the greatest mysteries in popular culture is wether this is a conceptual comedy masterpeice or a serious attempt at something meaningful. Either way, its a must-buy for fans of camp and kitsch."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This candid, lovingly made 1977 tribute to the Kirov strivers who make big sacrifices to attend the legendary training ground of Balanchine is a sheer delight, both aesthetically and narratively, letting us peer into a highly disciplined world of pure art where expectations are high and the weight of tradition almost oppressive. With Grace Kelly's warm, vivid narration providing the context and translations, we watch as 20 students out of 1000 are carefully selected according to predetermined physical requirements, then spend close to a decade mastering their dance skills. You can't help feeling anxiety and then excitement watching one graduating ballerina make her heart-fluttering debut on the Kirov stage after months of punishing practice. \"Street\" is a tremendously enjoyable, behind-the-scenes look at greatness in the making."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have it and the Bolshoi and Royal Ballet at Covent Garden in VHS, have loved Swan Lake since 1948. This is the best performance I have ever seen. Makhalina is amazing, astounding, inspiring, awesome as both Odette and Odile. I haven't seen anyone handle the arms so perfectly, apart from the poetry of the rest of her body. Zelensky matches an astounding physical performance to a great ballet interpretation of the music and the drama. The  Corps de Ballet discipline and artistry are impressive; the Pas de Quatre in the second scene of the first act is my total favorite. Love the whole thing."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've dreaded writing this review, as to do it justice I would have had to spend several hours writing down all the wondrous nuances of orchestration, choreography, dance by both principals and corps, as well as the superb videography to do it justice.  To take the lazy man's way out, let me just summarize that in 60 years of viewing this ballet, both in person and in recordings, this is the most enjoyable and artistically perfect of any I have seen.  In particular, not wishing to take away anything from my love for Maya Plisetskaya, I think Yulia Makhalina is far and away the best Odette/Odile of any I have viewed.  This is the video I would show first to anyone who has not yet discovered the wonders of ballet."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is an entertaining video - I was delighted to see the concert clips of Janis singing. I'm glad someone was recording her singing live in concert; it truly shows the powerful and passionate performer that she was.  However, I came away with the feeling that deep inside, Janis was really a sad person despite her success and free-spirit. This is evident in the interview at her high school reunion. One can also tell in the various interview clips whether she was on something, drunk, or straight.Janis was truly a unique and gifted yet tormented woman who, to this date, no other singer can surpass. She embodied the spirit of the 60's and there will never be another like her. It's such a shame she died so young."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Unfortunately I was not around when Janis hit the scene, however, watching this video makes me realize who she was as a person and entertainer.  I really love this and could watch it over and over.  I like the way they did the video- it has mixed studio sessions along with live performances and interviews with Janis all sprinkled together throughout.  Just listening to Janis talk is very plesant since you get the feeling that she was a hurting sole deep down but extremely intelligent as well.  She really knew how to rock a crowd though and all her performances- she gives it her all.  Many times after a live performance you see the audience come to their feet and clap.  I hope in the future they come out with more of these videos of Janis or at least put this on DVD- it's so neat to watch! 5/5 definitely"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Amazing live performances captured on film are the reason to see to see this.The interviews with Janis don't reveal much, and there's no real sense of her history. Even the stage stuff is shot pretty straightforwardly, but, man-o-man could she sing!One wonderful thing is that a lot of the numbers are uncut, allowed to go their full length, which, with Janis in concert, could easily be 8 minutes or more. The power, the emotion, the energy, the sexiness, the sweet sense of fun she brought to the stage could only be hinted at on her albums. For those reasons it's more than worth sitting through the slightly homogenized off-stage material.It awful to think that this is essentially unavailable.  Time for a decent DVD re-release!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Pack up the Plantation documents Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers \"Southern Accents\" tour. This video was recorded at the same shows as the album, the set list between the video and album do varey a bit though. Having the album Pack up the Plantation, I really enjoy it, so I figured I would buy the video. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers put on a great show! I've never seen them live,but know when I get the chance to go to one of their concerts I will. This a band that always plays great and sounds in top form. Even though this video is a pricey buy, I recommend it to all Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers fans, and to all rock and roll fans in general."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As a life-long TP fan, with reservations regarding some of the slightly obvious material, I bought this video when it came out.  Then lost it so some git who borrowed it and didn't return it.  Hard to get another copy in the UK, but it seems it is still around in the States.  It's kind of curious to watch a concert which occured before half the material played live these days was written - pre Wilburys, pre Full Moon Fever, pre Wildflowers.  Consequently it's a concert that Stan Lynch would presumably have approved of - Tp &amp; The H at their goodtime jangling finest.  It's as good as I remembered it, and my memory of it is the reason I've spent the last 10 years looking out for a new copy. Either it's very good or I'm an anorak.  Take your pick...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "That Jimmy is slow and uninterested in releasing this on DVD (as well as Tales from Margaritaville) says a lot about how little he cares about his fans.  In fact, most of his earlier albums greatly need remastering, and although he earns millions of dollars a year, he doesn't bother to do anything about this.  It's a shame that most fans don't see this, and Jimmy doesn't either.  Blind worship?As far as the concert goes, it's fairly good.  It does suffer some though from the time period (fluff songs like If the Phone Doesn't Ring It's Me, etc) and low lighting."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "There are a couple of good reviews on Amazon about this DVD already, so I'm going to try to keep this short. First off, this is a great DVD (both of them). The footage is terrific- showing many aspects of a Dead concert.But this DVD is more than just conert footage. By the end the viewer can almost feel the temperature of the place, the work and hours that went into building the stage, long hours on the road, and the flat out soul the Dead brought to the fans... and vice versa.I would suggest watching this DVD, the reading Mr. Lesh's book and then watching this again."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I cannot express in words how awesome this dvd set is. They did an excellent job with it in every way. The sound will blow you away, especially if you have a 5.1 system (you don't need it, there is a regular stereo sound option too) but the surround sound is insane.The extras are all top notch - stuff you actually want to watch. I have to say that this is probably the best music DVD purchase I have ever made - the content, the packaging the little booklet - it's all of the highest quality. Very highly recommended!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I seen the whole movie, and its great one, the music rules, etc,Anyway I really love music, by far the Grateful Dead and Frank Zappa, mothers of Invention R both of my all tyme favorites.Some of the instrumentals has elements that souinds like Zappa.Probably because both bands were made around the same time.Dead songs I can list prenty..Daek Star, Casey Jones, Freind of the devil, etc.And if you get the late 1980s album live one, some of the songs on second disc def. sounds like Frank Zappa doing the guitar but its Jerry Garcia. Space is the name of one of the songs.Anyway I'm in my mid 30s and dislike most of todays crap music.Both of the guitarist Jerry and Frank rules over gayga, I mean Lady Gaga"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought it on ebay auction and have watched it like four times in the last few days. the second disc is incredible too! i think the songs on the bonus disc are even better than the ones from the original movie! the second disc also has a couple of neat documentaries you may dig. this dvd was rare and overpriced for awhile. looks like price has recently dropped (copies selling at a little over $10)so if you love g.d. and you don't already have it, get it! BTW, why are there so many Donna Godchaux haters out there? She's not the prettiest bird, but she's definitely a sexy lady!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "my man, Norman, turned me on to the Dead. we have this movie and it is sooooo cool! if you are a fan, you must have it!Jerry produced this and made it, hired cameramen etc. and did it. shows back stage stuff, set up, the concerts, the hippies and fans in the crowd. experience a Dead concert - watch this movie - 'cause you sure can't go see the Dead in concert like this anymore. (Jerry is gone, sniff)a real cool experience - for sure. Dead-heads - buy it. curious? buy it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "this is an old movie starring animated farm animals in which this little girl plays with wilbur the pig a lot.what she doesnt know is todays porkbelly pigpen playmate is tomorrows barbeque.the spider likes wilbur too,so she spins messages of praise to wilbur for all to see.everyone gets in a uproar over this fascinating phenomenon and they hope to save wilbur this way.kids like it but theres a dead charlotte at the end so the emotional ones will be in teers.it is very much consistent with the book.my 4th grade teacher read it to us.its good too.the author e.b. white also wrote the trumpets of the swan and stuart little also.the message here is dont hold onto nothing for too long.especialy a big fat farm pig filled with pork chops and bacon.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  mmmm."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If your kids love classic animated movies, without any computer effects, and too many intense scenes, then buy 'Charlotte's Web'!Debbie Reynolds are the charming and wise spider Charlotte, that saves the young pig Wilbur's life, Wilbur is perfectly voiced by Henry Gibson, all the songs gives the kids many lessons, just like all the songs in 'Land Before Time' do, the animation is not getting up beside Disney, but if you like old fashioned cartoons, 'Charlotte's Web' is a must have for all ages!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "All I can say is casting Paul Lynde as Templeton the rat was a stroke of genius. Can you say *C*A*M*P* Boys and Girls?But the queeny sub-text will escape the intended audience, so not to worry Mom and Dad.E. B. White would probably object to most of the changes made here, but compared to the execrable and unconscionable changes made to his \"Stuart Little\" it is not even comparable and sticks somewhat to the original text.However, I strongly recommend that this story be reserved for five to seven year olds, for the theme of death of a loved one from the perspective of an innocent may be too much to bear for younger viewers.But if you can avoid watching this until you've read the original E. B. White story to your children you will have given them a treasure of memorable American narrative prose."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "for whatever reason with CHARLOTTES WEB it hasen't been digitally restored.this movie is just as good as any disney movie.but hasn't got the same treatment as one of their animated features,i don't knowwhy.i normally prefer the widesgreen versions of most movies but in the case of this original classic i believe the full screen is better its clearer and brighter.so until this movie gets a well deserved digital clen up full screen it is. the movie is as wonderful as ever great story for children of all ages.great music and a wonerful family film. the original classic dates back to 1972 but surpasses the 2006 live action nick remake."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is E.B. White's classic and timeless children's story in animation and music.  Charlotte the Spider (Debbie Reynolds voice) teaches Wilbur the Pig (Henry Gibson's voice) about life, and Templeton the Rat (Paul Lynde's voice)all join in the barnyard fun for lessons in friendship, trust, and love.  A marvelous film for the entire family.  It's a throwback to another age, this movie, and we all can learn something from a more quieter life, although in animation, it seems like the animals are just like us.  Or is it the other way around.  In any event, it's a fun film."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wilbur, the pig, is the loveable main character in this animated film based on the classic children's novel.  Newborn runt, Wilbur, is saved from certain death by farm girl Fern, but it is really Charlotte, the spider, who becomes his friend and ensures he will live a long life. A year in the life of a pig and a spider was never so entertaining or sentimental as in this movie.This is a great movie that both you and your children can enjoy.  There are some nice songs and the action is true to the book.  Henry Gibson is sweet as Wilbur, Debbie Reynolds is a no-nonsense Charlotte, and Paul Lynde is very funny as Templeton the rat.  A fun movie about the true meaning of friendship."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is not a Disney cartoon so the look is different.  But the level of animation is fine and isn't even noticeable because the video itself is so good.The story, song, and voice talents are extraordinary and this film easily gets 5 stars.  Any cartoon that has Debbie Reynolds, Paul Lynde, Henry Gibson, Dave Madden, Danny Bonaduce, and Agnes Moorehead has got to be top notch.  The music is also well done.  And of course the story from E. B. White is one of the classics.Kids and adults alike watch and rewatch this in my home and I recommend it highly for your video library.  Nothing objectionable at all in the film.  Enjoy!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I recently went rug shopping for my new house.  I got bored and let my mom and aunt do the rest.  So I went to the movie corner and other than this, was not able to find any thing that wasn't disney, wee sing, or barney.  But this was the top.  It was full of songs, animation, and music, which held interest not only of children, but of adults as well.  I'm nineteen years old and discovered it when I was 4.Charlotte was spoken by Debbie Reynolds.  She played Cathy in &quot;Singing in the Rain.&quot;  I began to wish Debbie was in the room with me.  I want to meet her someday.I hope that Paramount pictures decides to do a drama re-make of it like they did of Stuart Little.Enjoy!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is well done and I have had in my collection for years along with Domingo and Kiri in Covent Garden production.  I love them both but prefer Covent Garden just a little over this one due to the chemistry of Domingo and TeKanawa who's singing is better than Scotto's as she was beginning to dim vocally.  However, the two productions are so different that they are both required for any opera collection.  Domingo fans will just love him in what he used to say was his &quot;favorite role&quot;.  I recommend both versions!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The singing is great, with Scotto at top. Scotto acts as I've never seen her before and Domingo isn't bad in that either.  Levine's orchestral work is the best of his that I've heard.  The camera work is excellent too, with  almost flawless composition.But what sets this opera apart is the  passion and emotion binding these elements and its principals together,  rendering it much more than the sum of its parts.Yes, I thought that in  Act I they hadn't really gotten into yet, I wouldn't have minded a bit more  lushness from the orchestra, and the VHS sound is definitely no CD, but no  matter for a performance like this."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Some of the reviewers here dont understand this DVD,It starts off saying it's a Docu-Drama and that says it right.  It pretends to be a interview of two outragious guy's living in a strange place.The interviews are comedy sketches and pretty funny.The Paul Stanley mansion is sorta like the Playboy mansion with hot babes are around and Gene Simmons libes upstairs and it's large and gothic, very good writing, it's more like a well made low budget movie with music videos inserted in.Speaking of videos, there is a good stock of videos included from the mid 80's to the early make-up performances. Some of the videos are \"Tears are Falling\", \"Lick it Up\", \"I Love it Loud\", \"All Hells Breaking Loose\", Heavens on Fire\", \"Beth\" and more.A+ video, get it!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this video when it first came out in the 80's when I was in high school. At the time, it was the closest thing I could do to actually getting my heros in my house. I had/have all their albums - both the 70's, 80 and now 90's.Other people have talked about what's on it, and if you are a fan, it's a MUST. The only reason why it doesn't get a 5/5 star review is because of the serious lack of extras. Call me spoiled, but why couldn't KISS at least do a audio commentary?! How about bloopers? Anything?! It's just such a disappointment when other bands put out great DVDs that you can tell go the extra mile for their fans (ie: Def Leppard, Sum 41, etc...)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "No, I do no take Kiss seriously. But, at least, in their best years the released a lot of classic rock albums, with great tunes that influenced literally hundreds of bands to come.But in the middle eighties, they began to sell out to glam, and the mask was gone: the vanity and greed of Simmons and Stanley became clear for all to see. THat such hard-working and talented musicians became so shallow, it's something almost unbeliavable.This video (now DVD) is a fake from beginning to end, so bad as the newest SECOND COMING. The interviews are terrible, the girls aorund Paul Stanley's swimming pool are just models, most of them porn stars like Candie Evans and Blondi. As for the viedos, there are a handful of good old-ones, but most of them are from the glam phase.This DVD will add aboslutely nothing to you, just to Gene and Paul's pockets."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Today is my 50th birthday and I treated myself to a great show of David Gilmour. Yeah, I'm getting older and so is David. But I'm so tired of my Pink Floyd CDs, and this great DVD allows both myself and Floyd to age gracefully. These versions are actually fresh to hear and to see. And the biggest treat for me was when David brought fellow Pink Floyd member Richard Wright up on the stage to sing a beautiful version of his song Breakthrough from his Broken China CD of 1996. So far as I know this is Rick's only performance of his solo work. Too bad! But at least we have this one song to cherish. And also along for the show: Floyd saxophonist Dick Parry. It's just Gilmour and Parry opening the show with a spare but beautiful Shine On You Crazy Diamond. It's a wonderfully intimate show, beautifully filmed and recorded. Every Floyd fan should have this."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "For Pink Floyd and David Gilmour fans out there, a note of caution: this concert has no lasers, no pyrotechnics, and no giant inflatable pigs. In fact, there's just David Gilmour, his acoustic guitar, and a few musicians. Nevertheless, the scaled down sound works for this selection of Pink Floyd songs, some covers, and a (surprisingly) few Dave Gilmour solo pieces. The additional performers - a cellist, an oboist, a small choir, and a pianist, among others - help lend a fresh feeling to the old Floyd standards, but it's the covers and solo pieces such as &quot;Hushabye Mountain&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; that really shine. &quot;Je Crois Entendre Encore,&quot; from a Bizet opera, and the Richard Wright song &quot;Breakthrough&quot; (featuring the artist himself on piano and vocals) are worth the price of the disc alone, but if you need more there are some good extras and bonus songs to add icing to the cake."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Different, but outstanding nonetheless.  This is simply great music performed by a legend and a group of excellent musicians.  The versions of old (and not so old) classics are performed in an \"Unplugged\" fashion that enhances the essence of each composition.  I could not have enjoyed this concert more.  However, my only complain is that it was to short (that is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5).....it seems to be a compilation of songs from a much larger set.  Don't be put by this though, this is a fantastic concert DVD.  The sound is fantastic and the widescreen anamorphic image is detailed and full of color.  I wholeheartedly congratulate the person, or persons that decided to release this DVD in widescreen anamorphic, nowadays, it is the only way to go.  Thank you."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "...and this dvd prove it. Classics songs, an amazing good taste in selecting and performing those songs, which are in the heart of many ..Gilmour have the charisma of those who have everything clear....Of course, tracks like Confortably Numb (one of the 10 songs i loved more) and Wish you Were Here doesn't need too many words, but check out for the MARVELLOUS version of \"Don't\" and the SUBLIMEEEEEE!! \"Sonnet 18\"....This DVD deserves of all the attention. Don't miss it, please, and you'll be a happier person..."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Prior to the release of the marvelous \"Live At The Royal Albert Hall\", this DVD is also something special. Biased as this review may be, since I am a fan from David Gilmour from his first solo release to his last effort \"On An Island\". The acoustic versions of some well known songs, \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" for instance, gives this set a feeling that you are witnessing an artist filled with divine inspiration and good taste. The DVD includes performances by Richard Wright and Michael Kamen, both brilliant musicians that departed too early!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I know I am gonna offend a lot of Gilmore fans, but let's face it, Roger Waters at least has been keeping physcially fit.  The first thing that came to mind when I viewed this was, \"Gilmore has really let himself go.\"  It looks like he has spent his free time eating donuts, ice cream, pasta and McDonalds.  And to add insult to injury, he plays wearing an old shabby t-shirt.I mean, if you are bloated and overweight, try to at least compensate and put on a decent shirt.  It is painful looking at his grimace through his fat face.  David, I respect your talents as a guitar God, but please get in shape or your gonna die early and not fully appreciate what you have accomplished in life."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a very, very good concert featuring most of the famous singing duo's best songs, of which there were many. There is a good mix of fast and slow songs and so-so stereo. Too bad they couldn't have re-mixed this in 5.1surround sound for the DVD.Simon and Garfunkel are such pros. The two harmonize so well it's amazing and even though they were live, playing in front of a mammoth crowd, most of their songs sound like perfect studio takes. Yes, a couple might not sound as good as those original studio recordings but some - thanks to the great backup band here - sound even better than the originals!  Best of all, there are no \"clunkers\" in this group.The boys looked a bit smug, but when you can draw literally hundreds of thousands of fans to a concert, I guess it's hard to be humble. They were real superstars of their music era."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "somehow simon and garfunke will always have the power to draw me in and keep me there! and this is no exeption. the recording is great, and you catch the dialouge that you cant get on the album. the whole performance is  so moving (in a good way), even though it has its weak spots it is just  beautiful. with paul's soulful lyrics, and artie's voice this film is a  must have for everyone, whether you were there or not.as a john lennon  fan paul always makes me cry on the late great johnny ace. you really get  that feeling in all his songs though, that sinceriy that you can only get  from someone with true talent.please, get this video, you won't be  dissapointed!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The other 4 and 5 star reviews speak for themselves.  I'd like to correct a few misconceptions about this DVD, though.  Anyone who thinks that &quot;The Late Great Johnny Ace&quot; in not included on the DVD has not watched it all the way through.  Although not listed on the tacklist, it comes on right after &quot;A Heart In New York&quot;.  Another criticism was over the inclusion of seven Paul Simon solo tunes.  Paul Simon wrote almost all of S&amp;G's material.  In my book, any Paul Simon song that Art sings on is a S&amp;G song.  By that standard, there are only two Paul Simon solo songs.  Plus Art sings solo on two S&amp;G songs and his own &quot;A Heart In New York&quot;.  So I think it evens out pretty well."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I don't agree with any of the quibbles with this video.  My impression was that, while certainly it is clear there is tension between Paul and Art, both put their heart and soul into this performance.  The versions of Sounds of Silence, Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme, American Tune, America, and other songs are fabulous.  The back up band is outstanding.  Most remarkable of all is how Paul and Art, even though they rework the rhythm of many of the songs, sing in absolute synch without even looking at each other, as if they are two halves of the same soul.  Both men are in fine voice, the audience is totally enthralled, and Paul and Art even appear to warm up to each other towards the end.  I could have done without the reprise of Late in the Evening and the Simon song Late Great Johnny Ace (my own quibbles!), but these are trivial in the context of this great concert."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'm a big Zep fan and I really enjoyed the re-mixed 2 CD set of The Song Remains the Same, which just came out.  This DVD is a new release too....but why isn't it available directly from Amazon?  They ran out??  It just came out, and it is a major release (I thought...). They must want everybody to go for the Blu-Ray or Hi-Def versions.  But what if you don't have the type of player?  What happened to the regular DVD???  Someone straighten me out here...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Anyone who owns any &quot;underground&quot; Zeppelin performances (or, for that matter, BBC Sessions) knows that this is NOT Led Zeppelin at their best.  In fact, the 73 tour may well have been their worst.  If you're a  fan, of course you have to own this, but if you're a REAL DIE-HARD FANATIC,  then send some blank tapes to someone in a newsgroup and get yourself a  copy of a performance from the early days or the L.A. shows of '77.  Then  you'll REALLY hear what Led Zeppelin was all about... and you'll realize  that 'The Song Remains The Same' was an unfortunate mistake."}

The audio sounds just f-ing great and the video looks like it was shot yeasterday.Unreal......and with all the extra concert footage it is a must have for any Led Zeppelin fan or any music fan in general.Buy this now."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The more I listen to Zeppelin, the more I see the brilliance of each performer.  However, if one has to shine the brightest, unfortunately he also fell the soonest.  There have been many great drummers - Pert from Rush, Grohl from Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Them Crooked Vultures (with John Paul Jones) to name just two- but in the history of rock and roll and even other genres, there has been few that can play the drums not only as a rhythm instrument, but as an instrument in its own right.  Bonham added so much to this group that it is completely appropriate to that they broke up after his death.  Nothing against Page, Jones or Plant - they are all incredible musicians in their own right - but Bonham is the clear star of this group.  Not just in shear talent but in musicality.  He was able to add to any piece not just with technical brilliance.  He knew exactly what each piece needed to make it perfect."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Really I did -- usually along with Rocky Horror or a Jimi Hendrix film.  Had no choice since there was no video footage available to buy at the time.  Some parts are hokey, and it's a shame most performances are cut, but it's Zep in their heyday.  Does anyone else notice how much Crowe's \"Almost Famous\" rips off this movie (all the way down to the acoustic-accompanied limo ride through NYC)?  A better choice is the double Carruthers DVD.  That shows Zeppelin from their origins to their later years in un-cut performances."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was pretty impressed when I saw this when it first came out [in a theatre]. While its flaws are more obvious now, it is worth having for any Zep fan. The fantasy sequences are a bit silly at times, Planty's ego is too and some of the performances are a bit dodgy against Zeppelin's best work. But it is worth it just for the 25 minute 'Dazed And Confused', a magic moment in rock history, rambling but not a note out of place. Here and in some other parts, it is a joy to watch the band,Page especially, at work."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A nice collectible concert for living in the past as the song remains the same. Video transfer quality is ok considering the film is about 35 years old. Audio quality has been greatly improved and makes this title worthwhile for Zeppelin fans. This DVD replaced my VHS copy of the movie. The extras are also ok, nothing to get too excited about. If you are expecting the concert to look as good as modern day 16:9 standard DVD's let alone HD DVD's you will be disappointed. A must have for serious collectors as HD is being discontinued.  I give this release four flaming chilies as it is Led Zeppelin after all."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Led Zepellin is possibly inch by inch, the most complete, authentic and original rock band in the last sixties and seventies. From the riffs of Jimmy Page, to Bonham's drums. This concert on Madison Garden is not only a historical document but a timeless proof for the new generations who will born about the stature and presence of this heavy band. The ensemble, the original arrangements, the language and score of every one of his pieces will engage. I love from that age Moby Dick in which Bonham will give us a true tour de force, Lemon Song for instance, that was not played. I didn't like Whole lotta ` love , and to my mind Stairway to heaven, Rock& Roll and Moby Dick were the jewels of the crown.An unforgettable spectacle all the way."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Have they separated the \"dream sequences\" from the middle of the songs?If they did, this will become one of the greatest concert films ever.If not, toss it in the trash can as some of the most embarrassing, boring statements ever.#1 kick A$$ band of all times.Having seen Zeppelin in the 70's more then a few times.Also going to see this when it first came out and watching people walk out in groups.Let you all know the original generation of fans were not pleased.Don't let the retrospective pushers make you believe this was the real deal.Even during the \"midnight\" showings in the theaters. Most went outside to have a beer, or smoke a joint.Or stay inside and sleep.After all it is Led Zeppelin, and it's true their worst was still better then most everybody else's best.Get the Zeppelin DVD if you want something close to the real deal."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "although i had hoped to see the complete show as it happened, due to some legal mumbo jumbo they couldn't mess with the film release. that said, the remaster job is excellent! i don't know why people are complaining? this is still an awesome set, and lets face it, how much visual material of Zeppelin is out there...(more in the vaults i hope, for a possible release down the road)...i love this package, and the remastered cd set as well!!! 5 star all the way!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Finally after many years of disappointment with this concert film, Page has set the record straight...He took over the controls and the result is a brand new Zep concert movie! The Blu Ray sound is great (MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS FILM SINCE IT WAS IN THE THEATERS)  5.1 mixed correctly. (for a change, not all the sound comes from the center channel, its mixed beautifully). There are very cool new stage edits not, for some reason, in the original cut. It was actually shot very well, just edited poorly (the original cut) Now I can safely say it is one of the best concerts film outs there! The 'fantasy' sequences are still dumb, but it was a sign of the times...You see why, if you never saw them, why they are still so popular!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Led Zeppelin never got any better than this. There are videos available of their '75 and '77 tours as well as footage kicking around from the Knebworth festival, but this band peaked in 1973 and for those of us who fell out of love with the band by \"In Through the Out Door\" and Plant's wretched solo  material, this video is a great reminder of why Zep was a sold out huge arenas and sold millions of albums.My faves are the title song with it's great 12-string and 6-string mix,John Paul Jones \"No Quarter\",the BEST solo on \"Stairway to Heaven\" available and an excellent show closer which I won't name in case you haven't seen this yet.This is how it should be and how this band should be remembered."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was glad to see that this movie was released on DVD. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the lack of extra's, the only difference is the trailer, other than that it is identical to the video  version. Of course DVD is better quality video and sound, and that makes  this a must for Zep fans everywhere. If you are a new fan to the group this  movie will solidify your enjoyment of the band, and unfortuantely is the  only official release of the band live, with some movie extras with members  of the band. Long live Led Zeppelin!  Lets hope they release some  unreleased concert footage on DVD next!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is still one of the best concert films ever made, one that holds up to repeated viewing not only for the quality of the performance but the narrative of the film.  While the fantasy sequences and photographic embellishments may seem kitschy to some, they hold up remarkably well, adding a mythic dimension to the music.This was the film that made me a Led Zeppelin fan, and it's great to have it on Blu-Ray.  The video is astonishingly good for a film of this vintage.  There's grain in some of the outdoor footage, probably due to its having been shot with cheap equipment.  Overall, the colors are bright, vivid and crisp, and the picture is razor-sharp.  The Dolby TrueHD soundtrack will knock your socks off.  Wait till the neighbors are out and crank it up!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've been a fan since I saw them in concert in 1970. Their first four albums are classics. When this film first came out, I couldn't wait to see it in the theaters. I've only seen it once, and I thought the concert performances were HORRIBLE! So bad, in fact, I couldn't listen to LZ for a decade! Every time I heard their music, images of these god-awful performances filled my mind. I finally re-kindled my love for their music, and I never want to see this film again. If you really want the definitive dvd of this band, buy the 2 disc compilation \"Led Zeppelin.\" It is STUNNING from beginning to end, and shows the band in all their glory. Why they ever released these poor performances, when they had the great performances shown in \"Led Zeppelin,\" mystifies me."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First off, I love Zeppelin and The Song Remains the Same is an excellent live album and film.  But let me just pose a question:  Why is Amazon advertising this HDDVD if according to them it's not being released for 2 more years?  Huh??!!  By that time we could be downloading movies directly into our heads - a little \"Led for your head,\" so to speak.  Seriously Amazon, either figure out what's going on or take down this item."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A great performance, unfortunately undermined by a director and editor who think the movie is about them. The \"dramatic\" sequences are moronic in the extreme, and it's amazingly annoying to have the camera cut away from the performance to such pointless scenes as a bridge going by from a car. As though a band of this caliber and power needs some kind of visual support to make it interesting. . .  And even when they do allow us footage of the performance, there are a number of places where the visuals and the sound are completely unrelated---not just out of sync but Jimmy Page playing some other song than the song we're listening to.  It's worth getting for the performance, if you can tolerate all the nonsense you have to wade through to get to it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Having not bought this item I thought it was great. You may not have heard of Led Zeppelin because they are an obscure rock band from the 70's that now with the re-release of this re-release have released a new set of remixed re-releases that might, for the impoverished group, gain them some of the reputation they justly deserve. These tracks are remastered and remixed from the original remasters and remixed again to give a re-re-mastered quality remix, the likes of which you have never heard before. The packaging, which I haven't seen, is very poorly designed with flimsy card-board and undersized T-Shirt."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Although it looks great and what is there sounds great, Someone,I assume Jimmy Page, has made sweeping audio edits throughout the concert, jarringly restructuring some of the guitar work and \"fixing\" some of the \"mistakes.\" The good thing is that if you are not a dyed-in-the-wool Zeppelin fan--or just a casual one--you may not notice the copious alterations; however, if you've been rocking out to this show for years and know it inside and out, it is hard not to lament the changes when they, in most cases, neuter, or remove altogether, some of the swagger and spontaneity that crept into the original mix.I will keep my VHS, laserdisc, and original DVD release of this film and will retire this blu-ray and its revisionist audio mix to the forgotten dustbins of my garage."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "What can I say? This film was done in 1976 so visual editing was still,well, 1976 era type of editing. It's almost watching a home movie. Dont expect bright, crisp scenes. You'll realize this film has a ton of bugs as far as movie editing is concerned. Focus more on the music that these guys wrote and played. That's what this film is all about--- the music.The only sad note to this film for me is that I will never get to see John Bonham play again. He was to me the greatest rock drummer --- all time"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Every so often, I get an urge to rent this movie...and as hard as I try, I can help but nod off during \"Dazed and Confused\". I used to feel ashamed...and then I'd be talking to people and I realized I wasn't alone!There are some truly great moments in this show (\"Since I've Been Loving You\" and \"No Quarter\" among others), but the poor camera work (very choppy and WAY too much time pointed at Plant's crotch), the dream sequences and the more \"mainstream\" song selection make this one a yawn-fest.THANK GOD for the new Zeppelin set! A version of Dazed and Confused recorded when they were still interested in playing it!!Much better than the version here.This one is for avid, die-hards only. If you want quality and more album cuts, get the new one...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'm really a lucky man.Luckier enough to have this kind of work in my collection of cds, and now DVDs.This is an astonishing performance of one of the best rock'n roll bands ever.The performance of Jimmy Page is here,something i've never saw beforeand reveals all of the charismatic portrait this band ever had,specially among the brazilian youngers of my generation.The presence of Led Zeppelin music was a constant in my entire life.And what music!!!!!This is a fantastic gift to all of the new fans of good intense sensuous,amazing music.The performance of the band at &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;is stelar!&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;perhaps the most beautiful music ever recorded.Finally,all of this musicis a journey since the light begining,until the catharsis at that triumphant final!!A gem of the modern music.Something to get always at a special place of any great musical cds/DVDs collection!!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a &#34;cleaned up and expanded&#34; version of the 1976 release.  The sound, arrangement, and bonus material are fantastic.  I have fond memories associated with the original version and this new version only adds to those wonderful memories.  Some fans and critics have stated that these concert clips do not represent Zep at their best.  But, for me, I think they still stand head and shoulders above anyone else --- both in terms of musicianship and entertainment.  Unfortunately, I never had the chance to see the band live, but through this DVD set, at least I can imagine."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Their are plenty of reviews discussing the content of the film / concert.  My review is specifically intended to address the transfer of this film to Blu-Ray.  The source signal (at least on my copy) indicates a 1080i transfer (not 1080p).  Still, this is the best available version of this package to date.  Film is grainy in outdoor sequences, however concert footage is more than acceptable when considering the source material is over 30 years old.  Purchased this copy over the Best Buy website in December '07.  As other reviewers point out, it has since been discontinued in this particualar format and re-release timing TBD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought a CD some time back called Encomium, which was a compilation of tributes to Led Zeppelin's music. I heard it once, barely scraping to the last number.The nauseating monotony of that supposedly iconic anthology is on display in this drone of a DVD as well. Jimmy Page whooshes, Bob Plant moans, JPJ tinkers around with jazz-like riffs, and Bonham squeak-shrieks for about quarter of an hour, followed by about five minutes of audience cheers, of which you wouldnt want to miss a second, would you.Video-wise, during these shrieks we see dawdly 'fantasy' sequences, with some backstage interludes,  where we get to see their acrimonious manager trying on his backend \"hip\" and gleefully abusing stadium employees.Not my definition of a \"documentary\". Not my definition of anything else either for that matter, with the possible exception of Stairway to Heaven."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I use to be a big fan back in the day, and I recall enjoying this video a lot. Many years later, I am not quite so enthralled as I once was. Most of Page's solos are pretty sloppy IMHO, and Plant is off quite a bit as well. Some decent performances (Moby Dick is probably the best), but most are mediocore. As for the dream sequences, a bit goofy, but not that bad. Some interesting footage worked in as well. Worth a look if your a fan, but I would prefer to see a better performance from these guys."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Robert Plant and Jimmy Page were always somewhat disappointed with The Song Remains the Same, and it's not hard to see why...Some choppy and grainy video, not the highest-fidelity sound and certainly not one of their best live performances. But still, even Led Zep in a mediocre format is still 10 times better than just about anybody else out there. This is a also a great disc for younger Zeppelin fans to get a sense of what this band was like, including how crazy-huge they were, in their day.I actually like the cheesy shorts in this movie. It fits the mood of the time to a T, and they are funny besides."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was born in 1977 (around the time they cancelled the tour when Plant's son died), so I never got to see the Zep in concert. So I was pretty excited when I heard that this video was available a while back.But there are a few things that I noticed. Plant sounded like he was losing his voice, the music wasn't always synched with the video, too many &quot;cheesy&quot; (IMO anyway) effects, etc. This couldn't possibly have been the best footage available, could it? As much of a ZepHead as I am, I still cannot call this the best representation of them on film. It isn't, from what I've seen otherwise.Most expensive home movie ever made? Feels like it. I enjoyed the music, but the visual needed more work."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "in 1973 an amateur film crew made a half-assed effort to film Led Zeppelin on 3 below average nights at  Madison Square Garden on the nights of 27, 28, and 29 July 1973. The film was entirely financed by the band and shot on 35mm with a 24-track quadraphonic sound recording. In 1976 in an effort to pacify an impatient label, the film  started by director Joe Massot, would be finished by director Peter Cliffton and released in theaters all over the world.The special addition includes the missing songs that complete the setlist but they are not &#34;branched&#34; into the original DVD to restore the original continuity of the live set but rather included separately on the bonus DVD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Why anyone would want to watch a roadcrew assembling a stage is beyond me but once you fastforward that, and get to the part where Bon grabs his beer before heading on stage, it is absolutley powerful stuff. He is a combination of Brian Johnson and Robert Plant in his heyday...a wild rock and roll throwback that lived for women and booze. He lived fast and died hard, and I truly believe he had no interest in growing old, so he was called home after a hard night of drinking. All AC-DC needed that night was a stage, and the music is raw and hard driving...the Angus &quot;show&quot; is highly amusing and he plays his tail off, while Bon sings his off....highly recommended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First of all, the movie is great.  I consider Bon Scott to be the best rock frontman that ever lived.  So if you are getting this for the movie, you will not be disappointed.  The extras, on the other hand, are very weak.  All the extra \"footage\" is other peoplt talking about AC/DC.  I expected more real video of Bon and the band.  I would have gladly paid $20 for just the movie instead of having to buy this \"collectors\" edition."}

They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone). Can't go wrong with the price and certainly can't argue with the benefits of OEM vs. generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month."}

If you look at all the positive reviews for this case, you will see that none of them are verified purchases and yet every negative review, other than this one of course, is a verified purchase. What that means is that everyone who has actually bought and used this product thinks that it is crap. Furthermore, many of the reviewers have posted twice on this product, once per color. Why Amazon allows this is beyond me, but that is not the point. Also, if you look at the profiles of the positive reviewers, you will see that they have posted multiple positive reviews for PowerBear products and many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other.

{"label": 7, "raw": "A note of caution from someone who owned and used just about every major Blackberry model: if you already own a standard USB 2.0 cable and you don't need an extra, then you do NOT need this cable. All a Blackberry needs for data transfer is a STANDARD USB 2.0 cable with a Micro-USB connector at one end.There is NOTHING special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated MSRP listed for it. While this item is sold at a 90% off the MSRP discount, it's probably okay to purchase one, for as long as, after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a USB 2.0 cable.The items has 2 stars taken away for the exaggerated marketing claim (professional grade custom cable) and for the inflated MSRP.NOTE: Please make sure that you buy cable with a MICRO-USB connector because this is what your Blackberry needs."}

I don't know how people are getting these cables to work... but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about \"Unknown Device\" and \"Could not install drivers\" even though it works beautifully with the original cable.  The only setting that works is \"Just Charge\"!  Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw!  I've tried this with my Wife's Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well.  Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers.  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised.  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc., and at less than 25% of the cost.  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems."}

I decided to try it out despite the people that said it didn't work, and I'm glad I did. It's exactly what I expected and wanted. I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work. For only $4 and some change for the both...this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery!"}

However, while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I'll have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better."}

The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I don't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through."}

As long as you have a 2.5mm socket, you're in business. Audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss. And the microphones are simply top-notch.I've had only one break and that was because I crammed it into a travel case - and I mean crammed. With regard to ordinary daily abuse, these hold up well.All in all, an excellent value.Jerry"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws. The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job, so mission accomplished. The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft, meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you're screwing. (Sorry, there's no other way to say that.) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances. I think this set will come in very handy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much. The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked, once it's in the phone it is not an issue. So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced. So far I would recommend this battery.Update: 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything. Drained it and charged from dead several times, made sure that location services, blue tooth, apps closed... all OFF and still drained. Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery.... A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries."}

In fact, I'm keeping them around for other mobile phone work.The only thing I'd recommend (esp. for older folks with not-so-good eyesight) is a good way to magnify things so you can see what you're doing.

I have several revolvers and pistols which have sight adjustments that have outrageously small adjustment screws.

That alone made it worth the Amazon price and this little kit has a permanent place in my range shooting bag.  RJB."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset.  The Era comes with 9 different options for ear inserts.  But I always felt like the earpiece was about to fall out, unless I jammed it into my ear so far that it became uncomfortable.Enter the Jabra EarGels...  These made a huge difference.  It fit perfectly onto my ear (the nub on the top goes into the spot above the ear hole).  I could wear this all day.  I wouldn't wear these eargels without having an over-the-ear hook attachment on my Era, but these have made a huge difference for the comfort of my bluetooth earpiece."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic.  They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it.  Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset.  The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear.  I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so.  I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I like this Jabra earboom so much that I have purchased 6 of these so far.  And that is my biggest complaint, is their poor quality of workmanship.  They work well but just don't last.  Granted, I'm a road warrior and my earbooms probably go through more abuse than a casual user.  The reason I keep buying them is the audio quality is fantastic and the fit within my ear is solid.  I keep two spares on hand at all times so as soon as one fails I can throw it away and move on.  At this price, I can afford it.  Also, Jabra customer services is great.  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I tried using it with my Sansa Clip MP3 player in my Toyota MR2. The car makes a lot of noise in any case, so I'm not holding out for audio lab quality. However, the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click. I might have been able to tolerate that. However, there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine. The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player. The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok. I hadn't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long's to replace the Coby CA-747. The volume with the Maxell product was very weak, and I had to turn it way up. The Maxell didn't go click-click-click, but it whistled, too. So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me. I'm trying out the offering from Philips next..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who's cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door. I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter. I more than got my money's worth out of it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I would agree with the majority of the reviews. I purchased this for my car. I don't have the MP3 connection but do have a tape deck. And I wasn't thrilled with the quality of sound with the FM tuners (my brother has one for his car). There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing, but with road nose and the general nose of the car, it is a non-issue...can't even hear it. The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection, but I consider it very good...(not sure it's even fair to compare). I use this primarily for audio books, and I am very happy with my purchase. I have not had to try the fix that some of the other reviewers had (something about needing to take out a pin on the inside of the cassette).I would definitely recommend!"}

I am sure the husband will be griping the entire time he tries to get it unstuck.Avoid at all costs!I scanned past the negative reviews since this product had a few really positive reviews with a lot of helpful votes. Big mistake as now I have to unstick the adapter from my cassette player and try to get Amazon to take it back. (I bought 2 on clearance)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Great features - except for the phone one.  Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses).  However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one.  If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried.  I like the fact that it is small, that it sounds OK, and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it, which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them, they were about $3 apiece with shipping, and the first two are buzzy and could not be used.  I would not recommend this product. I went to an over the head headset by Jensen, and am VERY pleased!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it.  Well, my husband tried it and decided he needed it since he did a lot of driving for work.  I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back.I love that I can use these with my cordless phones as well as my cell phone.  I prefer the corded sets, they just seem to have a better sound quality.  I love that this earpiece fits snuggly around your lobe.  I wear glasses and this works out great.  I go between this style and one that wraps around my head, it just depends on which handset I pick up.  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "More importantly, the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap, thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly.  When mine arrived, it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in.  No box, no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band, just chucked it into a bag.  I realize it's super cheap but it should last a month.  Is there we are at now?

My wife even flipped her kayak and that was the true test, we righted it and checked the phone, dry as can be.I recommend these, i do wish there was some padding these came with as the phones do bang around inside a bit. I'll put my own inside, but for the price I think they could have included something."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I don't want to rehash all of the stuff that's already been said about this phone. Here's something that nobody told me before I bought it: You cannot use the Infrared port on this phone to transfer data to and from it using a PC. You can use the infrared on the phone as a wireless modem for Internet connectivity (this works for me) but the EasyGPRS software provided to manage phone entries etc. does not work with Infrared. I've checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this. When I called tech support they suggest that I buy their data cable (read: shell out another $70) for that purpose. It is very misleading to show this phone as being IR equipped while its use is crippled.BTW, I gave this phone 4 stars because it is still a sleek looking great phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have to say that this is a great phone and the Nextel service is great also.As for the review from the moron from Denver You need to have used it and the service before you open your mouth and make a fool of your self.People that review something and not have a clue just goes to show that stupid people should not breed.I have had the I90c,I95cl and the i730 and the 730 is great as for a alarm buy a clock if you need a alarm.The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it,the sound is as good as the other phones I have had.As for service I have had every carrier that is in the state of Colorado and Nextel is the best and for any one who is thinking of Verizon for push to talk well it sould be push to wait.If you want the best this phone and service is the best."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First a quick confession: I do not like T-Mobile.  I had them before and hated their (lack of) coverage and bad service.That said, the v300 is a very good phone.  I won't rehash the long feature list here.  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling.  This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the &quot;girlish&quot; styling, but it's still pretty cool.  Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "UPDATE:The person actually using these adapters (an 80 year old grandma) just reported from Bassano Italy that they worked just find and she charged her phone with no issues. So if a octogenarian can deal with something, that speaks volumes to the product!In her case, she was using an iPhone overseas, so any issues of power converters were moot. All she had to do was plug the US style plug into the adapter. Even so, it did work for her and she did it on her own. So that is a plus!**********************************These little adaptors look like they are well made and the price was right.i will add more when I get back!"}

{"label": 7, "raw": "Because of proliferation of USB based products, the USB hub is now more neccessary than ever. If you have multiple USB based devices (printers, keyboard, mouse, flash storage, USB speakers, iphone/ipod jack etc) and want to consolidate all your devices into a one single hub, then this hub does its job well.This devices works equally well both in Windows (Vista) and Mac OS (Leopard and Snow Leopard).It is about half the size of a medium sized hand.Each USB port has its own dedicated LED light. The LED light indicators, however, are little brighter than I would like. It MAY bother those who are extremely light sensitive while sleeping. But a cheap way to alleviate such a problem would be to cover the LED lights with tape.I used this device as a hub for all my USB devices for my MacBook Pro (2009) and the device works flawlessly, including for my USB speakers."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I use this on my MacBook so I can connect several items at the same time including a USB keyboard and optical mouse, my iPad and iPhone, a webcam, an external hard drive and even a light o Rama controller for my Christmas lights. This thing works great and provides plenty of power for all devices. I haven't seen any slowness in my webcam, iPad/iPhone syncing or even copying large movies to my external hard drive. This guy works great and I am not at all disappointed in performance. I am however a bit disappointed in the design. This has to sit on the corner of my desk and i need plenty of room on both sides to allow the USB cables to plug in. I would have had them design it like a tower with the plugs all on the back one on top of another. That being said, the current design does offer some added stability to keep the hub from falling over. Overall a great performer and a decent design."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this one based on all the good user reviews and its popularity.  I had to replace an older D-Link USB that just didn't seem to work at all on both our mac's and PC's (I had two D-Link's).  I had hoped this Hub would actually work unlike the D-Link hub and it does the job great!I bought two and hooked one up to the PC and the other to the Mac and plugged 7 devices into each.  Everything worked and I did use the power just to make sure I could charge off of it if I wanted to.  This hub works perfect and the LED's look awesome.Very happy with this product and would buy same one if I needed another USB hub.  Of course I'm sure the 3.0 versions will soon start to proliferate but until then this is a great USB hub and priced well for what you get."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "A very good high quality USB hub. Windows recognizes everything you plug into this hub and, the USB ports are nice and tight.I will say in my opinion, for a USB 2.0 hub, the Cyberpower-CP-H720 is at the top of the quality hub chart. You can plug a DVD player or web cam into this thing and it will work perfectly. My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine. The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "The light works exactly as expected.  As long as you are using your headset then the light will indicate that you are on the phone.  I do wish that the lights were a little brighter, or possibly multicolored.  We have an individual in the office that is color blind to red, so that would have been a nice touch.Also for obvious reasons, if you are using your handset, this light is not on.  I wish that the lifter had a feature that recognized when the handset was lifted by hand.  But that is a wish, not a product defect.Overall, I am happy with this device."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "This didn't do much for me. Unfortunately, it may not be the blame. Ironically, I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes (I thought). This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution. So in the mobile world, I'm sure this would be helpful. It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage, location, type of usage, cell frequency and more. So in putting a system together, for a whole home solution, you'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn't really as \"standard\" as one might hope!) However, it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn't care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).  The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase, so I don't know why it is proving as fragile as it has.  If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed, it is a good choice.  Otherwise, I suggest looking at other designs."}

The pad is made of a specific material that is able to hold the objects in place while you're driving.  It's not perfect, but for the simple task of holding a cellphone, sunglasses, loose change, perhaps your EZ-Pass, it will do the trick.I place a camcorder there to film road trips, and for the most part, it stays put.  Like any other product of this type, if you off-road, drive over unpaved roads, or you intentionally drive abnormally, the contents of the pad may not stay put.Summary:  Just drive normally, and you won't have a problem."}

I was actually looking on Amazon for a foldable keyboard and came across this and these reviews.  So I found my Stowaway (quicker than I thought I might!), did not load the software that came with it (as the instructions tell you to do), but just decided to see if it would sync with my Playbook.  First, of course, I had to put 2 AAA batteries in it and, VOILA, it worked!!!  I am a happy camper!!!  As another reviewer said, it is surprising that some other manufacturer hasn't continued this concept in folding keyboards."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I just love this keyboard. I've used it with my HTC and now with my unlocked iphone using BTstack Keyboard from Cydia. The only issue is that it really needs an extra row of keys. The numbers and symbols are placed on the top row of letters (where the letters QWERTYUIOP are in the keyboard). To access a number, you need to press the left function key and the corresponding letter. To type a symbol, you need to press the right function key and the corresponding letter. I work in finance and many of my annotations need numbers and symbols, like 10% for example. For that, it takes a long time. I find it easier to type \"ten pc\" instead of 10%.I'll buy a new keyboard just for that. But besides this, the keyboard is just amazing. So if you don't need your numbers and symbols too often, I really recommend it."}

It does perform as a keyboard should and it does carry out it's core functionality; but, I can't find the drivers for my device or any other WM6 device for that manner.

I use this keyboard with my Palm TX and it does a fabulous job during meetings - it's small (smaller than a notebook), VERY portable and reliable. the entire keyboard as well as my Palm PDA fits into the pant pocket of my cargo pants / shorts. You really can't get much more portable than that.To use you invoke a 3-button key combination to help it initiate contact with your device. Once connected, you'll be off and running. My Palm TX will only stay on at 1-3 minute intervals so the only thing I don't like about this combination is that I have to keep hitting a key once in a while so my Palm doesn't shut off. This of course is a design flaw of the TX and not reflective of the keyboard."}

If you have any HTC phone or any phone that supports bluetooth or this keyboard, or even a PDA, I highly recommend this product, although it is costly.  Pair it with anything that can run TextMaker Office for WindowsMobile and you have a meeting powerhouse in your pocket that can tackle the best college note taking in a much more mobile manner than a laptop, since you don't need to take it out of a bag, plug it in, and otherwise waste time.

I am using the iGo keyboard with a Blackberry Curve (8300).Like others have said, there is a nasty sticker that covers both the outside cover and the keys that may never completely come off. When peeling it off the keys, it feels like the keys will rip off their fragile posts.Also, as is common with Bluetooth, getting the two devices to communicate with one another can be tricky. I haven't used it a lot yet, so maybe I haven't figured out the right combination of button presses. But I hate when things don't simply \"work.\"The keyboard is fairly solid and certainly easy to type on, especially if you're accustomed to typing on a laptop.

The software that runs the headset is not as advanced as the LG, it doesn't announce the battery level and it can only be connected to one device at a time.  When it announces it is connected, if two of your devices have bluetooth on at the same time, you don't know which one it is connected to because it does not identify the unit it is connected to.Overall, though, I like them a lot.  The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use."}

It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird, b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving."}

The HS850 is a better designe here, but thats the only \"one up\" the 850 has on this headset. The volume and fitment of this 820 are much better than on the 850.

It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And, you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires, which feels a bit safer and freer, especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan."}

After 8 months, the wire is now completely detached from one of the plug ends.

Compared to the Sidekick II and many other T-Mobile phones, the A630 has the best signal-keeping capability, but T-Mobile just sucks big time, unless you live right next to one of their sporadic cell towers.  Worse, their GPRS (data) network is slow and congested.  While surfing the web on the A630 is really cool when the network is accessible, for most part of the day the network is slow and often inaccessible.  We really need the govt to step in and mandate that these cell companies upgrade their networks first before charging consumers an arm and a leg for data services."}

They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset, but not just a replacement, an $85 replacement! Then told me to keep the broken one, which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue!Really incredible customer support...I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name!BTW, 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price and read some reviews but I thought hey its Logitech it must be good.  I was right this headset is very comfortable compared to another headset I just bought.  The ear speaker is loud even to the point that I don't have to have it on the highest setting.  The mic was the thing I was worried about though, so I called my friend's cell phone and talked to myself and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound volume and clarity.  Also I haven't had any complaints from other friends I've talked to with the headset.  It has been my experience that Logitech makes the best wireless devices for the buck and they didn't let me down with this one (second Logitech wireless devices in two month; I also bought their xbox controller which is definitely also worth the buy.)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I used this phone lifter in combination with the Plantronics CS50 Wireless Office Headset.  It was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to 300 feet away from my office. This lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset.  You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing.  The setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone.I spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day.  This is a useful tool in any modern office and I recommend it to you."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this phone a few months ago and can truly say it is one of the best investments I have ever made! I had doubts on how comfortable I'd be lugging around a big phone like this, but that was short lived once it was in my hands. I get so much use from this phone, not only for the phone itself, but for the PDA capabilites. I have never been so organized and on top of things. The only thing is that it sometimes freezes when it connects with my Bluetooth, but it's a minor complaint and one easily overlooked when I look back and see how much this phone has helped me."}

The address book and calendar all work excellently, and the cross-functions are greatImprovements include SMS messaging, which is much faster and now includes hyperlinks for phone numbers and web addresses, unlike the Treo 600The web on here is faster ---- the screen is crisperHowever, BlueTooth is the BEST new feature ----- wireless data transfer is, usually, quick, and the wireless headphones are greatLastly - many have complained that the phone is too slow with its functions and unstable --- however, ever since the system software was updated to 1.12, it has made the phone much quicker and much more stable!Ordering a new phone today should come with that 1.12 software built into it, alreadyI am a former Treo 300 and 600 user, and the 650 is a wonderful upgrade and worth every penny, considering the bluetooth and software improvementsso buy it!!! - you won't be sorryPS - the Cardo Scala bluetooth earpiece is the best earpiece out there for this phone"}

(adapter is approx 1/8 thin)  The adapter has 3 tiny setting to adapt to different phones and I find setting #2 to work fine with my motorola HS820 wireless earpiece. This adapter works on Nextels direct connect and regular phone calls, my last adapter would not do the direct connect. So far I have had the adapter and earpiece on for over 16hrs with out a charge, while receiving many phone calls and direct calls during these hours. Can't wait till Nextel comes out with a bluetooth phone but till then, this is the only way to go!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought, exchanged, and then returned this unit.  Both units delivered to me would not turn on.  When I charged them using the supplied adaptor, the red charging light came on and a few hours later, the unit was supposedly fully charged.  However, when I attempted to turn the unit on by pressing the power button, nothing happened.  The unit never came on, could not be paired, and never worked.  I returned both of them.  I can understand one unit being bad, but two units that were shipped several weeks apart shouldn't be.When I called for technical support, I waited on hold for sometime, and then gave up."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This bluetooth is basically ok but the part holding on to your ear is very 'flimsey' and tends to want to fall off if u bend over so u have to keep securing it on your ear, which is quite annoying as I almost lost it a few times not realizing it was no longer on my ear...so it's a huge drawback for me. It seems to work ok otherwise tho sometimes I do have a  sound problem that is not present when I just listen straight from the phone without it...it's sometimes quite garbled. So this product for me though cute, is average in fuction."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:)  The H500 works fine with our LG Shine.  Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well, not too bad really).It was an easy setup.  The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why not 3 stars?  The volume control is hardly palpable.  It is hard to adjust the volume while in use.  Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust.  Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear.  It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought an H500 a few years ago when it first came out. It was plagued with low volume and poor connection. After using a nokia bluetooth for the last year I got this one again because of the no cell phone laws in California as of July 1st.This headset is plenty loud with my Sony Ericsson T650i and I haven't had it drop the bluetooth connection yet. The volume sits a little below half and I can hear perfectly in the car. Battery life rocks and voice clarity is a lot better than I remembered it with the first H500.4 out of 5 stars because the ear clip is flimsy and doesn't allow the H500 to sit tightly against your ear. So if you're planning on using this while running or during an intense walk - don't count on it.Definitely recommend this as a great bluetooth device. Can't go wrong with the price!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I needed a BT headset for the longest time.....since I never used one and was getting worried that I may get busted one day.  I saw this on Gold Box and ordered it immediately for $15....how could you go wrong?It is intended for use primarily with a Blackberry Javelin (8900).  It paired quickly has held a charge for 2.5 days thus far (light-moderate usage).  My opinion is that it does what it should at its price point and I was not expecting a miracle.If you are looking for a BT set that has loads of noise canceling and voice detection..then this is not for you.  Look for a Jawbone by Aliph...The H500 is a model that has been around a long time and is perfect for my needs.  I just wish it were a bit louder and thus I am giving it a 4/5.Great value, great item."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my first bluetooth headset so I don't have anything to compare it to, but so far it seems to be pretty good. It's small, very lightweight, and comfortable. It's hard to judge the comfort of this device unless you try it yourself because everyone's ear and head are different.I'm using it with a Motorola Razr V3m from Verizon. It paired easily and quickly. The connection is a little crackly even right next to the phone, which surprised me, but it's not so bad that it takes away from a conversation. Naturally, the further you get from your phone the reception deteriorates. Volume and clarity are fine and sound just like holding my phone up to my ear.Overall it's a good headset and fine for my purposes. Only a few drawbacks: the volume and call buttons are a little hard to manipulate, and it would be nice if the unit could be held tighter against my head."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.  Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option.  This phone is far and away the best one in that regard.  I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had a Samsung X427 before this and it was awful. Dropped calls, poor reception, wouldn't hold a charge. This phone changed my opinion completely. It does everything I need and then some, and the camera/video is a bonus. The only downside and the difference between 4 & 5 stars was that it did not behave well with my Jabra EarWrap-the remote button did not work-and the speakerphone is a joke. But speakerphone is not really what I needed, it was reliability and function.Really a far step forward-I recommend it for anyone needing a reliable phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.

Isn't it great?! Of Course it is :)I'm glad that I've tried it, I was even thinking if it won't keep the power for 3 hours for talking I'll need to go in AT&T; store and by original one for $40, the old one that was going with one kept the power for one and a half years. Will see for how long this one will leave."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought a different BoxWave Patent Leather Clutch with magnetic closure and was so impressed by it's functionality. BoxWave changed the style to a snap closure and I didn't realize it until I received it.I'm not taking stars away because of my mistake, but by the usual problem I have with snap closures. I have to spend extra time trying to snap it together because it doesn't just close on its own like with a magnet.The case also had marks inside under two of the stitches and shows mark on the patent leather as soon as I run anything slightly against it. I used this case once, maybe twice, had to return to the magnetic BoxWave leather clutch instead."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's shiny which is pretty but that makes it a fingerprint magnet. Its just okay. I buy a lot of cases for my phones because I like to switch them out a lot. This one is nice for the times when you want a dressier case. For everyday I think I will stick with real leather cases from Zenus. They cost a lot more but they they wear well too IF you buy their real leather cases. The case cover creases if you accidentally run your fingernail along it. It's permanent crease. Its bulky so it protects but makes the phone too big. I used to love BoxWave, but this one is a little disappointing.  Why buy a cheap case for your $650 phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Samsung Note 2 lets face it is a large phone... Howeva I am all about putting it in nice cases. This case hits a stars. Has a credit/ID slots and a money slot - Love that - so I don't have to carry a purse. Plus the strap is nice to have on wrist while on the phone (you know how crazy people are now a days running by snatching phones, extra secure). Best parts phone is secure in case holder when flip case over open. There is an appropriate hole in the back of case for the S-pen removal. Also the phone button closes versus most magnetic closure cases out here.Only con: No Speaker hole in front to close case while talking on phone.Howeva regardless -- highly recommend. Might get another in another color."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all. You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse. Money part needs length to really pack some cash in. Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase.  Id say purchase a cheaper product like this. Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless.  Buyer be aware. Update. I stopped using this. The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it. Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces. Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Boxwave case I bought for my Note II (Bodysuit) has disappeared from Amazon. This is the same case but with a uniform glossy texture.  I had a Boxwave case for my Note I and it was great.  This new case is even better.  It is thinner and more streamlined, and the buttons work even better.  This doesn't have cutouts for the buttons, instead it has well-designed buttons of its own molded into the case that push on the phone's buttons.  I like this because the buttons work just as well but they are protected at the same time from crud/damage.  Cutouts for the ports/mics/camera/stylus are placed perfectly and sized appropriately. Lastly, this case is made from TPU, which is the best case material in my opinion.  It's firmer so it stays on the phone better than the soft silicone cases and does not pick up lint or stick to your pocket, while still offering some cushion when you drop it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought two of these, one for me and one for my girlfriend.  She likes going out without a purse or wallet, but would like to hold her ID and credit card on her, and she does manage to fit both cards in this case, but it is a very tight fit.I use my case to hold my ID card for work.  It is an RFID card that we use to badge in and out of the building.  I always have my phone on me and therefore, always have my work badge on me as well.  The case is very low profile and holds up pretty well.  It doesn't offer a ton of front or top/bottom protection, but if you're looking for a case to take out to the bar, or something to hold a credit card/id, this works great!"}

I already had one that is essentially identical, except my old phone (Motorola V5510 has a different sytle adapter than the Razr, which uses a 'mini-USB'.This product is inexpensive, does exactly what it says, which is charges the phone in a car using the auto's power/cigarette outlet, and it comes with a cute little Motorola 'M' insignia which lights up bloue during use.  At such a low price - I paid less than $9 on AMAZON - there's really no reason to buy a non-OEM charger."}

This thing is junk, there is no way to replace the fuse (if there is one) without destroying it. I tried to take it apart, but you can't without breaking it. If this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design. Now do I break it open and hope I can get it back together or toss it??? I have NEVER had a problem with a car charger in the 10+ years I have owned a cell phone, that should tell you something! How do you screw one up?! You hire the idiot who designed this one thats how!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "For a corded headset solution, this headset is excellent.  I use it with my KRZR.  Sound quality is more than loud enough and quality is excellent.  One of the main issues I had was that I always have the air vents going in my vehicles.  In the past, people on the other end of my calls always complained about wind noise, with this headset that isn't an issue anymore.  Additionally, the headset is very comfortable to wear.There is only one item to be careful of.  When I first tried the unit I didn't realize that there was a mute function on the control cord.  As a result I called a particular person a few times and they couldn't hear me.  Finally, I figured out what was going on.  Of course it was user error.  Oh well.I would highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for one."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Sound quality is pretty good.  The wind \"technology\" is not bad.  Stong winds, blowing sand etc,  is going to get heard with this.  But for the price it is comfortable.  For someone who has to buy special adapters to get Blue tooth devices to stay in my ear I am impressed with this.  I wish it had a call end button on the thing.  But the mute button is great.  I would buy this again.  And i like it almost as much as my jawbone.  Paring is not an issue with wired devices.....  ;)"}

However, if you're okay with leatherette, it does have some nice pockets inside and it's relatively thin/lightweight.I'd avoid this seller though (BoxWave Corp). Shipping is $5 and you will pay to return the item to them. For me, it was a total waste of money as the shipping costs alone are likely far more than the product is worth. I paid $30 for the case, $5 for shipping to me. I'll be sending it flat rate back. Bear Mountain cases are better, real leather, and cost less (about $20 for the iPad Mini)."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the best bluetooth device I've tried.  It is lightweight, comfortable, easy to set-up, good sound clarity and it is a very well made and sturdy device.  There aren't flimsy parts that can break.The best thing is that the ear peace is fairly inconspicuous as it sits over your ear.  I really don't want to look like Janet Jackson in her Control video as I walk around town or the mall.The problem is in finding replacement ear gels.  They are not available on the Jabra site or on any other site.  I ended up back at Cingular (now AT & T) and they gave me a couple that they had in a drawer."}

But overall , I like the 250V. I recommend it to anyone. Just roll your windows up if your driving, or you wont be heard by the other end of your call."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have been using the HS850 for the better part of 2008 and have found it to be a competent little unit.  It pairs quite nicely with my Motorola i880 that was assigned by my employer.  I find the volume level to be good, though not outstanding.  I can hear the other party quite clearly and have had no complaints going in the other direction.The HS850 that I got from Amazon came with a charger and minimal instructions, but I had no issues.  After being plugged in for one overnight cycle it was ready to go.  The fact that the mike boom also acts as an on/off switch is great, as it tends to conserve battery life.  Are there better units on the market ?  Most likely.  But I feel that I've gotten some decent value out of this handy headset from Motorola."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Seems like Bluetooth headsets are a very subjective experience.  I have a Treo 700P and I tried a number of different BT headsets before I settled on the HS850.  I have no problems pairing with my phone and it fits my ear just fine.  What sold me on this particular headset was the outgoing sound quality.  My wife, mother, and paralegal all report that this is the best sounding headset I have had.  It does a good job of avoiding background noise. I previously had the Jabra JX-10 and despite good reviews from others, I found the outgoing sound quality low when there was any background noise.  The only criticism I have of the HS-850 is that the incoming sound could be louder."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm not a Bluetooth techie, so I can't compare this to other headsets, but after a month of ownership, I can say it works great.My car has built-in Bluetooth, but everbody tells me that when I'm in the car it sounds like I'm under water.  Not so with the Motorola - I'm told it's crystal-clear.The only negatives I have are:* The multifunction button has no tactile feel - it leads you to press too hard, and too often.  This is especially a problem when you're walking or driving.* The flip out mic is nifty, but the headset tends to wobble if you shake your head at all."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the second HS850 Motorola I have purchased, and they both work great. (The first one developed a crack in the ear loop after three years, but it's still working and I use it as a backup.) These used to sell for $99.00, so at this price it's quite a bargain now. (I bought the \"bulk package\"... it's exactly the same as the first one I bought three years ago!) I like the fact that it's easy to turn on and off by folding the boom. I keep it in the car for hands-free driving. The battery lasts and lasts... and it's easy to charge. You can get a car-charger, too! I like the fact that Amazon guarantees a genuine Motorola product if you buy direct from them, and it was even more of a bargain with no tax and free shipping!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have been very happy with this headset.  I use it with a Motorola RAZR V3.My last Bluetooth headset was a Jabra, and it broke after just a few months -- the power button quit working, so it was always on until the battery drained.I love the HS850 since it has no power button!  Instead, you just flip it open or closed.  It gets great battery life, since it's so easy to put it in standby by flipping it closed.I have also used this headset successfully with Skype on both Windows and Mac.  The only catch is that it can only be active with one device at a time, so you have to disconnect/release it from your cell phone, before you can successfully use it with Windows or Mac.  This makes switching back and forth between your PC and phone a bit cumbersome.  Of course, it took a couple of hours to get it working under Windows, but it worked first try on the Mac ;-)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got this for around $30, and it works really nice. My only complaint would be my ear starts feeling sore after wearing it for awhile, and like another reviewer said, it is light enough that it feels like it might fall off sometimes. My husband who is a truck driver said he couldn't hear through it over the noise of the truck, but I can use it and hear through it in my car just fine. It would have been good if it came with a car charger too, but thats just wishful thinkin :)"}

This cover has proved satisfactory in all respects: I dropped the phone a few times already and thing happened. After using the phone for 9 months, it still shines line new - not a single scratch. It is very easy to put on and off. There are 2 minor issues with this:a) You need to take extra care when you plug on the charger, to make sure the phone charges - the leather cover comes in the way of the charger - after a few accidental \"battery dying out\", I learned to connect it properly to get a full charge.b) The elastic band/top cover comes in the way of the camera - so for taking pictures, I remove the top sleeve.c) Inspite of all the positive feedback, I still feel it makes the phone bulky, but the belt clip is very tough, and I don't mind the extra bulk to act like a cowboy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Over the years, my household has tried multiple Bluetooth solutions for our hands-free communications needs. We've had acceptable results from a solution integrated into GPS...but much of our regular driving doesn't include the need to load up a full-size GPS. We've had acceptable results from a visor-mounted Bluetooth speaker unit, but let's face it: sometimes we want to hold conversations that don't include everybody in the car:-)The Plantronics Voyager 510 has proven its value overs more than three years of demanding use. It fits comfortably over your ear excellent incoming and outgoing audio clarity. Best of all is its outstanding ability to hold a charge for a long time. I can generally count on more than a week between charges, even during periods of heavy use.We liked this enough to buy three...one for each driver in the house."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have owned several Bluetooth cell phone headsets, and the PLT 510 is the best so far. It fits my ear perfectly, I can wear it for hours without noticing it, and it gives great sound. I had no problem syncing it to my iPhone, and although I haven't tried any other devices, I anticipate no problems.I only have two complaints:1. The on-off switch is very small and hard to use. I find that I have to push it with my thumbnail to make it work. If you have smaller fingers, you may have less of a problem.2. Plantronics uses a proprietary connector for charging, while other manufacturers are switching to mini or micro USB. A proprietary charging interface means one more wire to carry with me.In summary, a great purchase."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have owned this 510 for almost four years and have worn it nearly eight hours every day.  I have been very satisfied.  The cons for this ear piece are it does not block wind and background noise very well.  My ear buds are getting very loose after four years, so I am ordering another set of those.  I also ordered a new pro plus headset after watching the product demo in the wind tunnel.  Very convincing.  I will rate the new headset after I try it out.  At any rate, you can't go wrong with  the 510."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This unit replaced a Motorola HS850 conscripted by my wife :-)It's better than the HS850 in the following ways:1) People hear me better.  Mic is really good.2) When the unit fits properly, audio amplification is betterIt's worse than the HS850 in that:1) it doesn't fit as well.  I find myself readjusting it throughout the day2) It doesn't synchronize instantaneously with my MPX220 like the HS850 did.  It always syncs eventually (15-60 seconds).Battery life is a tie.

Is much clunkier than my last Plantronics (330). My phone knows it's there but is often very slow to transfer over to the headset.Overall, I am disappointed with the headset - other than the range between it & the phone, it's is not as good as the Plantronics 330."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've heard great things about this, so I tried it. Everything is great about it, except two things that made me want to return it.First, there is a little bit of crackling once my phone is across my body on my hip, and that is annoying to me because I've had some that never do that. I've noticed that Plantronics and Jabra tend to have this issue regularly with their headsets. The other thing is that it is bulky, and I prefer something a little more pettite.It does have good battery life and noise cancellation. So, it's a matter of preference when it comes to the things I disliked about it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak. The other person can not hear me at all.  So I contacted Plaintronics for repair.  Their repair process has no tracking, just sending in your headset to an address.  Two weeks later, I received a used one back, not the one I sent in, packaged in an OEM box. Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in, it battery is not very reliable to hold charge, also the battery portion is kind of loose.I can not recommend Plantronics product at all."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It took me just a little time to get used to this headset but I do love it. I have to admit that for the price, it works really well. Sometimes, it loses connection even though the power is on and bluetooth is blinking blue light, but if you reset it, it reconnects. Sometimes, I have not heard calls come in so reliability for me has been around 95%. I am giving it 4 stars because for the price and comfort, it works quite well. Watch out for battery drainage on the cell so if not using, make sure to power off the bluetooth Power On to Off. It is a concern not to lose it - it's small and without wires. I left it in the Juice store but it was right there when I went back (lucky me)!I highly recommend it overall!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Definitely a much better headset than the other two Motorola models that I also own -- it is loud, clear and the battery lasts a good two days between stand-by and light/medium use. It is a little larger in size but it is light in weight and comfortable for extended wear (3-4 hours at a time).There is one drawback, the unusual power cord/plug. After only 1-2 months of use, the headset started to not charge properly unless the plug is connected to the bottom of the headset just right.***10/2008***I liked it so much, I bought one for my wife. Unfortunately, hers die within 2 months with very light use. And, I mean 'light' -- it spent most of its life sitting on her nightstand. The light indicator went dark (not turned off) and it wasn't picking up her voice when she speaks into it. We returned it for a replacement and this one appears to be working just fine."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We have two, and we love them. They work very well, like much better than the Motorola's we had, and these are quite stylish and unobtrusive. Now, I will say that I switch back and forth between the smallest ear piece and none at all - with it, it fits better and you can hear better, but it starts hurting a little after a while, have to take a break; without it, I can wear it all day, but, it dangles a little awkwardly and sound is sacrificed, a little, but certainly bearable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my second headset replacing the Motorola one that came with my cell phone.  People I call tell me that the sound is very clear on their end and cannot tell that I am using the headset - sounds just like I am talking into the phone.  That was not the case with the first one. I travel a lot and wear the headset for long periods.  My ear does not get tired or sore from having it on.  The headset seems well balanced and never seems like it is going to fall off regardless of what I am doing.  I also like that it folds flat for easy carrying in my shirt pocket."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this for my self to use with my Motorola V3XX. I got home on the delivory day to find that my husband had fallen in love with it. He had allready paired it to his Blackberry. I had to purchase this one for my self. I have had only one problem and my husband has the same one. We are not able to walk more than 10' from my phone before we get the crackeling sounds and loose the ability to communicate with the person on the phone. We love the sound quality! We love the quality we get on he other end. The person on the phone says it all sounds great."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The sound quality is tops both at the sending and receiving ends. However, the ear hook is on the thick side. This can be a problem for ears that lie close to the head - the earhook pushes the ear away from the head. First, this does create a rather odd looking mismatched pair of ears! Second, it can become uncomfortable after prolonged use. It also poses a problem when wearing eyeglasses - one temple rests on top of the headset ear hook with the other at ear height. This causes the eyeglasses to rest lop-sided. So, buyer beware. The sound quality is great. The comfort issue could be a problem for you."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When I first got this headset, I originally rated it at 4 stars. I've had it for 5 months now, and I'd have to lower the rating to 3 stars. I really don't hear much better with the headset than I did the Jabra headset I had before; it's a little better, but not worth the extra $45.00 in price. The other party can hear me better (which I attribute to the longer mic.), but they also hear everything going on around me too. The noise cancellation feature is not great. Also, I find the earpiece hurts my ear if I wear it much more than a half-hour. The battery life, on the other hand, is great. I can go several days on one charge. In summary, I'm still in the market for a better headset."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset was purchased to replace a Jabra BT8040.  The goal was to get a headset in which 1) people could hear me clearly and 2) I could hear them clearly.  After having this Plantronics headset for over a month, I am very pleased with the purchase so far.  With this headset, I have had no complaints that callers can't hear me or complaints of interference.  Also, I am able to hear the caller well.In researching buetooth headsets, I opted for this one based on the performance review and price point."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a great headset but for one thing. The voice call feature on my phone quit working when I upgraded from Windows Mobile 5 to 6. I called the phone manufactor, the cell phone company, and the headset company. None know what to do, only it is incompatable with Mobile 6. Mobile 6 does not use voice tags on selected contacts. It changes voice to digital and looks for what you said. It cannot change the voice from this headset to digital. It works great on answering, not calling with voice. It works great with calls that dial out also.So make sure your headset is compatable to Mobile 6 for voice calling. Of course this assumes that your phone can make voice calls.Again, it works with Mobile 5"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The reviews available on this product from the amazon website really helped me make a great decision.This model may not be the \"latest\" technology but it's enough for me. I only use it in the car because of all the issues that have been raised about driving safety. I feel better with both hands on the wheel, both eyes on the road.I'm not a device geek but this really works for me and the few requirements i have.Simple to use, I set it up in 10 min max.Fits fine, but I do activate the connection before i go down the road because the buttons are small and can be difficult to activate if you already have it behind your ear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This was the best Bluetooth I have owned because of performance and more importantly the fit. It was very comfortable on my ear and inside the ear, and I could keep it on for hours and not even remember it was there. Sound quality and features are excellent and worked as advertised. I have used with various phones. I used it every day for about 2 years until it started to break at the hinge. I used to just stuff it in my purse without a special case or protection, so I am not surprised it finally gave in. I see this product being sold for a lot of $$$ now, but I don't think I paid more than $40 for it. So it was a great deal and a great value. If I see it on sale again, I would buy it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this due to the law changing to hands free in my state.  I am not a big fan of bluetooth but I saw the writing on the wall so I read the reviews and picked this one.  I am glad I did! This was very very simple to set up and charged very quickly.  It synced easily with my android phone.  I like that it comes with various sizes ear buds so you can get the right fit. It stays securely on my ear and I never feel like it is flapping or going to fall off.  When I make calls, the person I am calling says I sound like I am talking directly on the handset so I am pleased.  I have not tried any of the voice command features yet so I cannot comment on those. Overall, I am pleased and would definitely recommend this headset!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been able to carry conversations in my bedroom and bathroom while the phone itself sits in the living room!  The reception has been amazing.  I travel beyond 30 ft in different parts of my apartment and still get clear calls.  My friends can't tell that I'm on a BT headset.  In fact, they say it's clearer than if I were on a wired earpiece.  My problem with dropped calls has plummeted to almost nothing because I now position my phone in a decent area and talk wherever with this Plantronics BT.This is an ugly headset compared to others, but it works!  There's no point in having a cute BT if I can't use it.  I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Unfortunately, I purchased mine when it was $100 and have never been able to use it.  I didn't return it right away because I thought I would be able to read the directions that came with it and figure out how to unmute it, but have never been able to.  I can hear the other people, but they can't hear me.  No matter what I do, it won't unmute.  The buttons on it are very small and difficult to use when it's in your ear.  I finally got a different bluetooth that works just fine."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset is a replacement for a logitec I had used for years.  It is my second bluetooth and the fit is great.  It does not hurt the ear and stays in place very well.The noise canceling is not on par with the logitec, but I added a wind sock and it resolved most of the challenges.The audio is not as good as I would like and the controls are confusing to me.  I think the former because my current phone is a 1.1 and the latter because I am use to the logitec.All in all a good value for the price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "For several years I used a Logitech Bluetooth for my cell phone, and while it worked great, it was always uncomfortable. When it snapped in two, I decided on the Voyager 510! Wow, not only does it work great, but it is VERY, VERY COMFORTABLE! In fact, I can honestly say I actually forget that I am wearing it, something I cannot say about my previous device. So for all of you thinking of a headset, you cannot go wrong with this one! Five stars!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I thought to come write this review because it is the 2 year anniversary of me buying this phone. I have never had any protective cover or case on it and it is still not very scratched up and it works as perfectly as when I got it. I had to replace the battery at 18 months but it cost $10 with shipping online for a genuine Motorola battery. Every other cell phone I have had has broken in some way long before 2 years. I'm amazed it is still in such great cosmetic and mechanical shape. No reason for me to get a new phone anytime soon."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had a RAZR V2 and it was the best cell phone I ever had so I up graded to the RAZR V3 late last year (2007).  The RAZR V3 is by far the worst cell phone that I've owned.  It is beautiful and has great features but it keeps failing I have had 5 of these phones so far (the original purchased one plus 4 refurbished replacements) 1st phone: after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 2nd phone would not charge from the get go / 3rd phone after about a month the screen would no longer light up / 4th phone after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 5th phone has been working for about a month now.  I really like the RAZR phones, WHEN THEY WORK but this V3 model has been terrible and I would rate it lower than 1 star if possible."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Searched for \"droid 3 chargers\" when making my purchase. This was the first product to pop up, had decent reviews, and was cheap. I purchased 3. The product arrived on time. HOWEVER this product does NOT fit our droid 3 phones. I contacted customer service over the course of 9 times. No results in replacement, return or refund. Contactd by phone and w/in the first 2 min of the convo the F-bomb was dropped twice. Very offensive and unprofessional. Needles to say, I have 3 chargers that dont fit any of my phones. Anyone wanna trade?"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I ordered this charger as a travel companion, so I didn't always have to pack my original charger.  It's been wonderful having one I can just leave at home and one that travels with me.  I've had no problems with this charger at all.  Be aware that this is a MINI-USB connector, and while it will charge my newer smart phones, it requires a Mini to Micro -USB adapter... and is not as fast as the new chargers. But it does just fine for an over-night charging from less than 10% to fully-charged."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "As other people have said, the headphones are a bit too heavy on the ears.  After 3 weeks the crack in the headband started, after 2 months the crack is so big the headphones stopped working.  I will try returning them for a replacement but I don't see why, as the design just isn't very smart with the headband cracking in the only place that is under stress.  They should have reinforced that one spot.It's a shame as the sound was really top notch and I used to be able to connect them to my ipod and leave it in my bag, or connect to my PC via 'bluetooth advanced audio' and not disturb my wife while I'm killing  zombies in Half-Life 2."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This Bluetooth 1.2 version has since been replaced by the newer generation, but the price of this model has come down by nearly $80 as a result.  I've used them for working out in front of a TV (if you equip your set with an inexpensive 3.5 mm audio out jack), listening to iPod, portable dvd player in the car, and computer.  Pros: The sound is quite clear and true, provided you aren't an overly demanding audiophile. The single charger has a Y-shaped adapter end permitting charging of both the adapter and headset simultaneously. Cons: they are considerably heavier than corded headphones and become a bit uncomfortable after an hour."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "his and the white version of wireless headphone for ipod is being clearanced elsewhere for a good reason. I got one and it really cracks just by being flexed often enough, which is really unavoidable no matter how careful you are. It is only a matter of time. Mine cracked within a week, and yes I knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful. Unless you have a really small head (maybe the size of a softball), don't mind a cracked band or enjoy going through customer service, don't get it. it looks and sounds good otherwise, and works with computer bluetooth adaptors provided that you have software driver support for high quality bluetooth audio (a2dp). it's a pity."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I just purchased the Treo 650 with AllTel (not specified here on Amazon) and have loved it.  It took me a couple days to get used to the feel of the bulkier PDA phone compared to my smaller LG, but once I got into it, I love it.  The only complaints I would have are that it does not come with a docking station (must be purchased separately) and the only way to make it a \"great\" phone from a \"good\" phone is to add close to $100 worth of various 3rd party software.  While it's a lot of money to bring it up to speed, the flexibility and having options are nice.  Nothing's perfect, but so far, so good (and AllTel has a 30day money back guarantee or exchange deal, so nothing's lost here)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Just received it today from A1 Accessories.  I bought it solely to use on xbox live so I wouldn't have to keep moving my other headset that I use for work (I work at home).  My friends kept asking me to repeat myself.  One said that he had to turn down his tv volume so he could hear me (no lie).  I switched back to the other headset and I was back to crystal clarity.  After that, I threw this one in the trash.. Good thing it only cost me $5 or so."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am using the Jabra BT350 with a Sony Ericsson K750i.  This works like a charm.  It took a while to set up (problems with resetting my phone), but once I synced the two devices, I have not had any problems.  The sound quality is superb, and the functions are outstanding.  They include vibrating alert (I've turned it off), call accept and call decline (much needed).  It also allows you the opportunity to automatically call the last number dialed. The voice dialing also works great.  I was not able to record the name through the BT350, but once recorded, the phone recognized the name when spoken through the BT350.  An addition, the battery life is great.  I have not had to recharge it in a while.  All and all, this is a great choice for a \"handsfree\" set to be used with a mobile phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset fits so comfortably on my ear and I especially like that I can use either ear. I can hear so much better with the Jabra than the expensive Motorola headset I had that was always falling off my ear.  In fact I was using the Motorola talking with my son, in a lot of pain and needing help.  When I turned my head, it fell off and out of reach.  My son called an ambulance when he could no longer hear me. My elderly Mom says she can hear me better on this headset too.Spring 2007 and this item stopped working.  I'm irritated that it didn't last longer."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had a motorola Bluetooth headset.  I felt like Lt. Uhura with a giant ear piece in StarTrek.  I had a hard time keepig it in and after 20 mintues it hurt my ear.  It came with my accessory kit in one box with the car charger and case so I just used it and grumbled.  But when my toddler flushed it I got the Jabra as a replacement.I love it!  It works and stays in my ear, feels comfortable even after 3-4hours in my ear.  I use it only when I drive and I have used the voice dial and it works perfectly.  I set the voice commands using the headset and it works.  When I set them without using the headset it did not work well.Great little device."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought it expecting it to be much better than the one I've had for almost two years now. Big disappointment. The static I used to get from the bt250 has not gone away especially when I have my phone in my left pocket of my pants and the headset on my right ear. Also, people tell me my voice sounds remote like I am in a room.This is not acceptable. I am going back to BestBuy to return it. Why pay $120 if there's no added value?!No doubt, it wraps around your ear very snug unlike the Motorola headsets but there's virtually no improvements compared to BT250.And let me guess - the next Jabra model would be BT500v for vibrate. I can tell you now - I ain't buying that one either.I guess it'll be a while before someone comes up with a headset that's not static-y but I'm willing to wait.Roumen."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "In case you were wondering, the ONLY differences between the black and silver RAZRs are:1. The Color2. The Price Tag (at some stores)There are NO new features in the black RAZR.  It has all the same specs (and bugs) as the silver model.In choosing a RAZR you should consider which color you like best, and whether or not you're willing to pay the price premium some stores are charging on the black one.You should also read the reviews for the silver model, since both phones are the same inside.A couple of other notes:-The keyboard on the black RAZR is silver.  Some people do not like this.-The RAZR (probably the silver one only) is rumored to be coming to another US carrier very soon (Hint: starts with \"T\", ends with \"obile\")-There will be a lot of new sharp looking phones with features superior to the RAZR coming out this fall."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This very high quality retractable cable will retract to as long as 32 inches (I measured this). And it will easily retract back into the holder making the length of this whole cable unit at just 4.5 inches, which is PERFECT FOR TRAVEL. For me, I purchased 3 of these (the maximum that is allowed in one order). And I am so pleased with these I hope to order more later on.You may wonder if the cable part is flimsy...If it is not yanked, rather pulled gently and retracted gently, it will do fine. Remember not ot yank the cable out and it should last just fine.+ The main pro I find over this cable and non retractable cables is you just pull out the length you need, and no more dangling cables!Very highly recommend this as it works well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This thing is tiny & lightweight and works really well in a vehicle where you don't want long cables hanging around (especially if you drive a manual shift car).That being said, I have had two of these. I used them daily, and they each lasted about 4-6 months, and then they stopped working. The cables are very thin and I think they just wear out after a while. For the price & convenience, it's not a bad trade-off. I would have given it 3.5 stars if I'd had the option.I decided against ordering a third and opted for something non-retractable but hopefully more sturdy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have used this cable on and off for about a year and a half -- but there were at least six months in the middle there where I had misplaced it and didn't use it at all. It recently went bad -- lost one of the stereo channels. It now connects one channel only.The problem is in the contacts. If I bend the cable near one of the ends I can get the other channel to come in intermittently. Note that I didn't ever fiddle with the ends during normal use. I have only tried the bending game to get the lost channel to come in.If you think the price is worth about 1 year of use, this is the cable you want to get. It certainly is convenient and I like the retractable feature a lot. Just wish it would have lasted longer."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been using mine for over 4 years and it's finally starting to show some wear with the wraparound earpiece, and having a few issues with it shutting off unexpectedly.  All in all, for having it over four years, it's a great purchase.  Although I'm still using mine daily, I'm ready to purchase a new one, and one with a battery is the best, as I simply carry AAA batteries in my car, so whenever this one dies, I just put a new one in on the go.  No worrying about bringing it into the house to charge, forgetting to take it back out, or losing the charging cord.  I love it because it's so convenient and can leave it in the car 100% of the time, so it's always for sure there."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This earpiece worked well for me.  It had good range and sound quality and the hands free activation was very useful. One huge design flaw as I see it however was the on/off button.  To turn on/off the device you have to hold down the button.  After only a few months of use the button began to malfunction and over time the button totally stopped working. I purchased the device in November and by March the button had stopped working at all.  Since this is the same button that you have to push to answer a call, disconnect a call or activate voice recognition when the button stopped working the device became pretty useless."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought the Plantronics 320 today. As soon as I walked out the store,the reception went static beyond belief.

For the past week  I've bought 4 headsets(Motorola 500,850,700,& this one which is one of the worst.I found the Motorola 700 to be the best so far.  Clear reception most of the time,excellent volume(no problem hearing while driving),& it always connected to my treo 650.  On a windy day my friend on the other end didn't even know I got out the car,hardly any background noise.  I just ordered the 700 through Amazon,much cheaper than Cingular & Motorola."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I just got this headset from Best Buy. I paid a little extra there because of the counterfeit scare in the online world! However, I just love the sound. Specially the bass. Most of the ear-bud style headphones suck at reproducing bass. My T-Mobile MDA has paired up perfectly. The A2DP and the volume/play/pause/mute work like charm. I would give it a 5 star but it's a little bulky for the gym. The cloth interior of the speakers will not stand the sweat for long. The shocks at the treadmill are yet to be tried out."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Before I have this product, I have ordinary earphones for my Moto680 cellphone which has stero radio, also I have other moto blue tooth earphone, but this one is good, long time power supply but it is more heavier than the single ear bluetooth.Volumn control is good, loud enough. single ear BT is out of control some times, you may hear nothing when you walking on the busy street or windy days. This one give you all availability.drawback: 1. when phone call comes in, you will wait for longer time than single ear BT. 2. the size is big, can not put in your regualr pocket. 3. the pad easily drops, you may lose one of the two very soon. I used glue.Anyway, it is good one, you can talk to 2 hours meeting several times with one time full recharging.I love it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Durable.  Sounds great.  Mic provides good sound for those on the other endof the connection.  I like the wrap-around fit (walkman-style headphones look dorky - wrap around is better).  Although.. after 30 minutes the tips of my ears can become sore which I am learning to cope with.  I use it with Motorola L2 cell phone and Anycom 250 USB dongle for Skype.  This is the one to get.  I had a competing Plantronics product -- in fact two of them -- but they both broke in the same place due to the use of plastic in high-stress areas.  The Motorola design is much smarter."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I like the \"in the ear\" approach. It's extremely comfortable. You have several options as far as finding a comfortable fit. It comes with a portable charger, which is a prelude to things to come.I could hear any caller without problems but in noisy environments they couldn't hear me. In a quite environment it worked very well. The battery is terrible. Their listing is \"up to 3 hours\". There's no way you can get that much talk time out of this. I heard allot of static. I couldn't wear my phone in the holster because of that.I'm a frequent business traveler and it doesn't work well for my needs. However, it does have some positive traits. The main two problems are extraneous noise problem and poor battery life. So if you're not in a loud area or heavy user it's a great headset."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the best headset for truckers. The back ground noise can not be heard from caller. The ear pices is just the right volume. the Mice takes some use to it. When you talk, you talk in a normal voice. and don't have to speak up to be heard. If you put the mice at your mouth, it will distort the sound. The best place just below your lower lip. The paring has to be done every time to turn the headset on. Will not automatic paring at turn on. Good thing its easy do to.The charge time is great and really holds the charge in stand-by and talk time. the only thing I don't like its heavy and sometimes the mice gets caught on the shoulder strap, when looking side to side."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm on my third z520a in the six months I've owned it.  The only reason I haven't gone through more is that I've accepted this phone is a lemon.  The phone freezes and can't be shut off, requiring removal of the battery to reset, frequently drops calls, doesn't always let me place calls, and just plain does weird things that result in an unreliable and frustrating call experience.  What is even more annoying is that I purchased expensive, model-specific accessories that will become useless paperweights when I replace this with a new phone - a phone I will be out additional hundreds on, not to mention the cost of accessories.  I'll never buy another Sony Ericsson product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The design is good and it would be an excellent product if the quality was anything more than terrible. The buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking. Now I press and press and nothing happens. It's a shame because the rest of it works decently.The suction cup holds well and the tube coming from the cup is pretty sturdy. It moves a lot when the car is moving so you would need to rest it on the dash which would help somewhat but not perfectly.Overall one star only because with the poor quality it is worthless in spite of the few good points."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Great idea and design, not great execution and materials.It works good, but once mounted, almost impossible to adjust-out the sides with the ratcheting mechanism.

When mounted, you can't tilt it, so it's a real hassle to open.I have mine set, and I just wedge the phone into it when I want to use it.I primarily use it when driving through New York city, to use my phone as a dash-cam. Eventually I'd like to get video of the people that walk into my car or cyclists that ride into it... It's great for that.It's obvious the plastic or construction material allows it to fall out of tolerance, which means the ratchet action ceases to function. It's a crapshoot when you build a complex mechanism out of parts that break or wear easy, or aren't built to spec in the first place."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We bought the Plantronics CS-55 Wireless Headset over three years ago for use in our small business and it was one of the best purchases we have made. My wife asked me to get her wireless headset that she \"wouldn't have to mess with\" so I selected this one since it is what my company uses (a Fortune 500) in it's call centers. Here are my observations:+ Good Range; the unit covers all of our fairly large shop+ Easy to Setup; just follow the simple instructions and go+ Easy to Use; simple as picking up the phone and turning on the headset (we addedPlantronics HL10 Handset Lifterto make it even easier)+ Great Sound Quality; we never had any static issues, even in our heavily wireless environment- Heavy; not absurdly so, but takes some getting used toThis headset gets used just about everyday that our shop is open and it has never given us any problems. It has passed the test of time with flying colors!Highly Recommended!CFH"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We finally tried the Plantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headset and it is AWESOME!  We were using Plantronics CS50 headsets and they just give off feeback and crackle.The Plantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headset is really great, good sound quality, no feedback, no buzzing in your ear!  And people can actually hear you!We have 7 wireless headsets working in our office and 2 are the CS-55.  Once the CS50 ones break (which will be soon) I will be replacing them all with the CS-55!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This phone has grown on me.  At first I wasn't sure I needed all this stuff, it felt a bit heavy, I was unsure of the swivel design, and I felt guilty for buying such an expensive phone.  But now I know I'd buy it again.  It's still a little heavy (compared to the Razr, which was my other choice) but the reception is great, it has lots of functions, and the interface is easy to navigate.  Best of all, the speaker phone function is one of the best I've ever heard.  It's loud and clear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my first blackberry.  How I got along without it all this time I have no idea.  Earpiece quality sounds great, speaker phone sounds great, microphone sounds great.  The overall layout is quite genius.  I love all the programmable features and the bluetooth accessories are a must.  Web browsing with EDGE technology is surprisingly fast.  If you text message often as I do, the keyboard and the \"auto-text\" features are amazing.  I literally send text messages 10 times faster than I used to.  If you live by email as I do, (90% of my clients orders are placed through email), receiving them instantly is so important.  No more running back to the office or home to check for orders.  I highly recommend this product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Galaxy S3 is a great phone, but its finish is very slippery, and the phone is too easy to drop. This case solves that problem inexpensively, and without adding a lot of bulk. The volume and power keys are harder to operate than without the case, though. That's a good thing for the power button, as it prevents accidental power-ons. It's not as good for the volume control, though. But it's well worth the price.Note that in order to get the holes to line up right, I had to put the volume control side of the phone in the case first, then stretch the case over the power button side of the phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The weight is nice and balance on the year is good.  The features are good, but one must remember certain button combinations for extended features (like press two buttons at the same time to mute the microphone).  The battery life is good.  A significant issue is that it picks up surrounding noise better than the person's voice who is taking, which means that it often can't be used.  If you don't drive a very quiet car, like a BMW or Mercedes, then users may complain that they can't hear you and ask you to \"pick up the phone.\""}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this bluetooth as a gift for a family member's Sony Ericsson cell phone.  We had to play around with it at first to get it working properly.  She still has minor issues with the headset, but overall she likes it.We decided not to return the headset because I did pair it with my iPhone 3G, after three attempts, without using the passcode.  I was able to use most features easily, with clear reception.  So the earpiece isn't defective.  The price was to good as well.Buyer beware, and do the research on the pairing capibilities with your electronic device and this bluetooth."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews. I got it from Circuit City, so it's not a 'counterfeit'.  It pairs well with my Moto Q9C, and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it. The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise, and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable.  I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had my H700 for almost a year now, and not until recently did I learn it was a FAKE!  WOAH!  After reading the PDF on this page about how to spot a fake, I quickly learned the one I picked up on eBay was a fake.However, the headset has worked VERY well.  I compared it to a bluespoon AX7 in-ear headset, and I ended up keeping my fake H700.  Overall, it has been a very good copy, although not the real thing.  Very reliable.  However, I am still disappointed that I did not get the real headset.Is there anything I can do about this?"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I previously owned an H300 and was impressed with the quality for the price.  When I lost the H300 I decided to try the H700.  I was most interested in the improved sound quality and the fit around the ear.  In those two areas the H700 is definitely an improvement over the H300.  I did not use the voice activated commands, so I cannot speak to that, but I do see where that could be useful.Overall I do see the H700 as an improvement over the H300.  My only problem with it, which is why I did not give it 5 stars, was the Bluetooth drop out.  It seems that the Bluetooth on the H700 drops out more often than the H300.  I would say that it drops out on 1 in every 20 calls."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had the 850 and thought that it was decent but could be better so I bought the 700. Let me just say that I own the Motorola V330 and from reading the other reviews, it seems that this headset works best with the razr. That being said, it does not work well with the v330. If you move more than 4 feet away from your phone, you get a ton of static. People tell me that I sound muffled when I'm talking to them. My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this bluetooth headset for two main reasons. First, it uses the same charger as both my Motorola Razr and RIM Blackberry 8700C. Secondly the device easily turns on and off each time you extend the microphone.I've used about 1/2 dozen other bluetooth headsets and this is one of my favorites.Here are my summarized pros and cons:PROS:-Uses the same charger as other Motorola RAZR phones-Open/Close microphone to turn headset on/off-Small, lightweight and easy to put on (one handed eve)CONS:-Only connects to one BT device at a time. I have both a RAZR and Blackberry that I carry with me everywhere. With these two devices I cannot have the H700 connect simultaneously (other Bluetooth products - notably the Plantronics) are able to connect simultaneously to two devices.I recommend this headset, and Amazon has the most competitive pricing available. Easily beating even the discount superstores where I'd seen this for 50% more."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I like this headset. It is very comfortable and lightweight. Stays on fine when adjusted properly. The volume is great. Callers say they can hear me fine without noise interference. What I like best is You can close it to turn it off an open it and it automatically reconnects. You can answer call waiting with this too. Also I haven't had it randomly disconnect as I turn my head as my other one did. I don't know about battery life yet as i only have had it 3 days."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When I got it I was a little scared. It was my 1st bluetooth and it looked like something straight out of Star Trek. You have to be a little careful with the twisting earpiece since it's in a sliding ball inside and can slip out of the groove very easily if you change ears too much(which mine did on day three). The range is not as far as you would like it to be, but boy can it hold a charge. It'll outlast your cellphone battery everytime! And, the fit was pretty comfy behind the ear. The buttons are also very easy to use. Remember to speak up though...people tend to have a problem hearing you as well as you will be hearing them."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love the size, form factor, and usability of this headset.  Incoming sound is good.  Unfortunately, the outgoing sound is a deal breaker.  If there is any background noise, this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice.  The DSP helps a little, but affects the sound quality dramatically (think overcompressed MP3).  I am an attorney and need to talk to clients; I need to sound professional.  Unfortunately, this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic.  I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [...] headset, but so far I have not gotten it to work.  I am willing, though, to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have this headset for work and use the band that wraps around the head instead of just the ear loop.  I find this is the most comfortable option for me.  The headset has been great and I have never had a problem with it since i have owned it (approx 2 years).  The range is great and I can get up from my desk and walk to the printer during a call no problem.  Overall I am very pleased with this headset and others in my office have purchased this based on my recommendation and they love it as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "While waiting for my order to arrive, I read a negative review about a terrible echo.  My advice to that reviewer - consider reading the instructions and adjust the mouth piece away from your mouth (not in the instructions).  Initially the headset hanging on one ear was a little uncomfortable, but within days I was walking out of the office forgetting I was even wearing it.  The range at the building I work is less than 100 feet, not a problem for my use.  Can't imagine not having the headset lifter or the flashing light accessory that clearly tells others when I am on the phone!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My old Plantronics headset needed to be replaced and I went with this one.  It is much more sturdy, with the headset resting very comfortably in the charging unit.  My old one would 'float' once in a while and not charge when I thought it was, which meant I couldn't use it the next day until it charged for a while.  Not so with this unit.I had a behind the head band I use which for me is very comfortable and I can quickly take the headset off and it rests on my shoulders.  Sound quality is excellent.  I have not had any complaints on the other end either.Highly recommend this product for anyone needing versatility and walking around from the base unit.  I can easily get files from across the room or do other things while talking without missing a beat."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am extremely happy with both the sound quality and the range from base on this set.  The freedom of not being wired to the phone & headset base it great.  My only complaint is that the \"over the ear\" pieces are very hard & uncomfortable -- there are several sizes but after a couple of hours, all earpieces are terribly uncomfortable (and I am someone that has worn over the ear headsets for 10+ years).  I finally switched to the \"over the head\"  attachment, which has a nice, padded earpiece and it solved the problem.  I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.  I would have given this 5 stars if they had figured out how to make a comfortable earpiece."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been having it for weeks. It works fine when both listening to music and talking via Skype. The mic pick up my voice quite well even with that small hole away from mouth. Once fully charged, it lasts a long time when using it for stereo music streaming.Pros: Sound quality is great, as being a bluetooth headphone. Battery lasts long enough. The microphone does pick up sound perfectly.Cons: Feel a little pinched above ears after wearing it for a while. It would be great if the belt is expandable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this one 2 years ago, it still work well, battery life is good and I recharge it once a week, it can be charged on car too.Volume can be adjusted easily, I like chat with driving and it is a wonderful earphone.With a cable you can connect to your pc directly and listen to music too.In winter it is so wonderful, as it is a ear protection in a cold and windy morning:-)it is a little bit heavier at beginning, for man it is perfect, my daughters can not wear it without holding it.in one word, it is a good product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had these for a while and liked them.  If I wear them for more than 30 minutes, the top of my ears against my head hurt.  I was willing to put up with that because I liked the wireless aspect, and they sounded good.  The ear cushion is great, it's just the weight pushing the rubber shark fin piece against your ears that hurts after a while.Recently I laid them down at work over the weekend.  I guess I laid them down incorrectly, because they are now misshapen.  Once that happens, you are out of luck.  They will no longer fit against your ears.So they sound great, but no longer fit.  I think the ear pieces are just too heavy and it relies on the plastic head/neck band piece to maintain an exact shape.Anyway, I am disappointed and will not buy this model again."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm using this product past 5 months and its b'ful and awesome sound quality. I didn't found any issue with this product. Easy to configure and connect. It works with my Sony Erricson W580i Walkman phone as well as my laptop. Sound quality and beats are very good. Distortion only if u move your head 90% on left, but ignorable. Its not bulky and fit easily. Its in build mic is good. While playing a music if call comes u can atend it with this headset. It has its own volume adjustment. Overall, a good peace which makes me fully satisfied. I got what i was looking for. no wire hassle now."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought these to pair with my Samsung P2 music/video player. The pairing was easy and all of the features work well with the P2 except I can not change the equalizer settings on the P2 when paired and P2 does not support FM radio with Bluetooth.The sound quality is very good (not too much bass) and great for a wireless headset but not in the league of the Shure earbuds that I have or the Bose Quiet Comfort 1 (both which cost significantly more than the Jabra). Listening to music or watching videos in places where wires are problematical --- as well as those who exercise with a music player --- these an easy buy, espcically at the price of $38+ dollars.I don't use these with my cell phone as I use a Jawbone for my cell. For some reason the Jabra paired with my computer but I am not sure why I can not get sound. Dell's Bluetooth module has always been problematical, so I will assume it is the computer and not the Jabra."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Very good value for the money. Phone is very nice looking, a little elegant and conservative I would say.The metal top gives it a little better look and feeling compared to the previous plain razor V3. I use it heavily for work and even so the battery charge is good for 2 or 3 days. Speakers sound nice for mp3 playing, the camera takes clear pictures and it is full of other little extras, however if you are a fan of advanced features and apps,then think twice.For me and for work this phone is perfect.The only thing that i don't like much is that the volume is not so loud, and if you are talking in a noisy place you may want it a little higher, and also be advised that this offer does not include the little memory card so you have to buy it separately.Delivery was very fast and so far I can say I am happy with this phone.If you want a day to day good looking phone I recommend you to get it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The batteries were exactly as advertised, they were delivered in a normal timeframe, there were no issues or hiccups or drama with the vendor.  It was \"slam, bam, thank you, sirs or madams.\"  Battery life is really subjective as everyone's \"normal\" is different.  But life is definitely restored compared to my original 2 year old battery.  My experience is use of Bluetooth really drains batteries quickly.  But that's a Bluetooth issue that goes away if you don't use Bluetooth.  I have no complaints at all with this product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this direct from Amazon, and their \"unlocked\" phone is technically unlocked, but it has Cingular-branded firmware.For anyone not familiar with that, \"branded\" is a euphemism for \"hacked up by the carrier to remove features and replace useful menu options with links to buy stuff.\"  I guess \"branded\" is shorter than saying all that.This is not a \"clean\" L7.  You may as well buy an unlocked Cingular phone from ebay.I have not yet checked all features to see what has been removed from this phone, although I immediately notice that even signed Java applications require constant \"permission\", while an unbranded phone would accept the Verisign certificate."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought the SLVR for my wife and a RAZR for my self. People who want iTunes should buy their phones through a service provider who includes it on the phone. Our unlocked SLVR (apparently produced for use in Europe...it came with European plug and a US adapter)did not come with iTunes. Having read the reviews I expected this. My wife uses her phone primarily for talking and text messaging. The SLVR has worked well for this. The only issue is that some of the shortcuts don't work. The main one missing is the one which you use to lock your keypad so that buttons are not accidently pressed. We get this message saying shortcut not available on this phone. Other than this small annoyance my wife and I really like the phone. We're living in Hungary right now and the SLVR is not sold here, so it's extra cool for others to see. The small, thin form factor is great. I'm almost tempted to get one of these to replace my RAZR!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The case is easy to use and hold securely to my belt or waistband. My phone is easy to put in and get out when I want it out, but remains secure when I don't need it.The only problem I had is with the belt clip.  It came to me with a fine leather covering over the belt clip.  The belt clip is very tight, and the second time I put it on my belt, the leather covering it tore and came off.  It really didn't affect the functioning at all, but I was annoyed that something I just purchased came apart on the second use."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I spent a good bit of time reading Amazon reviews about Treo cases. Most of the cases had very mixed reviews. My Palm One Treo 700/650 Pouch Leather Case is stylish with a nice soft leather. At first my Treo moved around a little in the case. This little movement was not very noticable or bothersome. After I remembered the little pocket inside the case, I put 4 business cards inside. These were just enough to keep my Treo from moving. Actually the pocket can't really hold more than 4 or 5 business cards without making it difficult to close the Treo in the case. I really like the magnetic flap. It's easy to open and close. Finally the belt clip holds securely on my belt."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've owned two of these. It is great that it rests against your ear, and is very comfortable not having an earpiece sticking in your ear. The first one I owned, after a month, lost most of its volume. I could not make the volume louder via the volume control; the volume control actually never seemed to work, but at least at first the volume was real good...for about a month. The second one I bought lasted about 9 months, but now the button to answer or hang up on a call does not work."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've paired mine with a Razr V3 black and a Razr V3i without any issues. The sound is perfect, no static or other interference. Callers on the other end can hear me clearly and vice versa. This is very lightweight and portable and I cannot recommend this enough!The only thing I want to mention is that when I purchased this a while back, the getting started guide was outdated and gave me an older sequence of steps for pairing the device, so it was frustrating in the beginning until I realized that the instructions were wrong. I went online to Motorola and got the proper set of instructions, and voila, perfect!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Took this to Hawaii so I could keep my stuff safe while in the water.  It would only fit either my cell phone or my camera, not both (plus some cash, credit cards, keys, coins, etc). My cell phone is small (smaller than iphone), and normal size point-and-shoot camera.  The strap is very uncomfortable though when u go underwater (for a long time, like snorkeling)... the whole thing spins and squeezes your wrist...and it hurts. Other than that, it kept everything dry the whole time."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this product for a dive trip to Fiji. While in Fiji I decided to take a kayak out with my camera inside this 'waterproof' case.

Once I was out a ways I wanted to take a picture of the resort. When I lifted the case I knew there was an issue right away when water came pouring out.My camera was ruined on the 2nd day of my 10-day vacation. There is no place to find another camera. I would have been better off putting the camera in my pocket than this case.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have had this phone for almost a year now. I have not had any major issues. Though a little slippery to hold. The bad part about the keyboard is that you have to use two hands for it. I have been reading about people losing their stylus', I haven't had that problem so far. I have added a 2GB mini SD card for my tunes. Although this phone does not like Macs, it is a good windows device which requires occasional reset. A built-in task manager would help."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Great interface, but the pen is faulty. I have used the Palm and the pen is easy to use. The pen for the mda doesn't work sometimes and it's operation isn't smooth. The screen isn't very big which is a turn off for such a heavy and bulky tool.The email tool doesn't have an option to set business hours so you have it still downloading mail 24hrs, that wasn't good. i like my business tool silent when I am at home. And it is locked by T-mobile such that you can't install Java applications like Google maps.I returned it, for the weight it should give me the feel of an HP-IPAQ or mini-computer but I didn't get that feel at all."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It is a bit clunky..that is the bad news. All the rest is good.The phone is terrific as a phone. It has good clear sound, an easy interface, and helpful links to your contacts.The browswer feature is awesome. Edge-enabling means you have virtual 24/7 access to the internet, and to your email through the web or an Outlook style program.The 1.3 MP camera is more than adequate for the opportunity shots when you do not have your camera handy.This is a far superior product to a Blackberry unless you need push. I do not, but I have heard push software can be downloaded.I have had Pocket PC's in the past, and had no learning curve with the program. The reality is however it is quite user-friendly and takes little time to master."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The price I paid for this package was good, but the cost of shipping negated the low price. I had seen lower price from other web retailer, $8 with free shipping. Most advertizements online include just one cable. This phone tool package has two cables, one for mini-USB and one for other non-mimi-USB phones. I guess the extra cable is worth a few dollars. The software does not have much on it, but you need it to manage your phone book on your cell phone and to make your own mp3 ring tones and upload to it. Other phone maker like Samsung, you can download similar utilities for free from their website."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have had a few of these (broke them, totally my fault) and I use them with the adapter for my Android phone. I am very sensitive about clients and calls with press people hearing me clearly, easily and consistently. I take this headset and the sister 3-in-1 version any day over several bluetooth headsets I have purchased over the years. I know its an older product, but it works extremely well. If they made them out of Titanium, I would buy it at almost any price because I have trashed (again, my fault, dog ate one, I crushed the other) two of them. Thankfully they are inexpensive."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought a Plantronics bluetooth headsetPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headsetfor the car and was extremely happy with it. I wanted to leave it in the car, though, because I knew if I took it with me when I got out, I would never remember to put it back in the car.  I decided to get a wired headset to keep in my briefcase because, despite being very technically literate, I'm still leary about something emitting radio waves stuck in my ear all day.  The MX505 has been great.  Most importantly, it's durable.  It also has good sound quality and the people I call have no trouble hearing me."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "If you have a child who you want to carry a cell phone, but don't want to pay lots of money for all of the extras (or if you yourself just want a \"basic\" phone), this is a good value for the money.  Large screen displays numbers very clearly.  Sound quality is good.  Battery life is a little short and the phone cannot be used while it is charging (that's a pretty big negative, IMO).  But overall, this is a good starter phone and serves the purpose.  If you just want a dependable phone to carry with you in case of emergencies, this phone fits the bill nicely."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Beware Tracfone. I regret that Amazon won't let me give them 0 stars. We got this phone for my wife's aunt last December. After 1 year of trying to get this working, she still cannot receive calls. She can call out, but no one can call her. Tracfone support is useless (and generally only marginally speaks English). You also cannot manage the phone or minutes on line. You have to call in and give them about 60 digits that the phone shows you to do almost anything. We're letting this one die with over 400 units left on it because it is basically useless. Coverage isn't good either, but who cares if you can't receive calls anyway? There has got to be a better option, because I doubt there are many worse ones."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this thing for years now, and use it all the time. At one point I went to plug my USB cord in without looking and totally smashed the internal stuff up inside the top! I thought it was broken, however after finding something small to push the innerds back down to where the cord would once again fit inside, it's worked just fine. Never cuts out or anything. I still have to be careful, otherwise I'll push the internal casing back upwards - I'm sure I broke some little stabilizer - but I can get it back down easily. I'm impressed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Went on a cruise, wanted something waterproof for cell phone and wallet contents while on the beach or doing activities where stuff might get wet.  This little number fit the bill quite well.  Durable plastic, clever latches that work well to seal the top.  I leak tested it before leaving, and was impressed with the seal.  When we went snorkelling there were free lockers to use, so I didn't actually use it IN the water, but I would have felt safe doing so if lockers weren't available. We like to canoe during the summer, this will be much more convenient for cell phones, etc, than the larger dry bag I have been using.  My wife was impressed enough with mine that she wants one by summertime.  Recommend!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "With buying a $400 cell phone out of pocket I wasn't going to take any chances on it.  This pouch saved my phone's life!  I attached the pouch to my mountain bike with large rubberized bands (made for the purpose) that stretch and wrap around the bars and have loops on the end to stretch around the phone.I unexpectedly sank and tipped over in a small stream my phone and bike became caked in mud.  I washed off the case in a river and my phone was just fine on the inside.  This pouch has become coveted by fellow mountain bikers who do it without protection... on their phones."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have a very nice Bluetooth headphset with a power connector that is simply not accessible by the cable unless I charge it unfolded.  The design is really bad for me as I want to be able to charge it folded.  The right angle adapter is just what I needed and the price was right.  It works pretty well for me, so I am giving it 4 stars.I have to be a little nit-picky, but I actually would have preferred a &#34;left&#34; angle connector -- the right angle works for me, but a connector pointed in the other direction would have worked even better.  Note that the connector exactly matches the picture in the product description so I knew what I was getting ahead of time.  I just wanted to get something that apparently nobody makes.  Anyway, if you need the right angle, then it will be a 5 star review for you."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am using this to keep my Garmin Nuvi 360 powered up while driving.  I didn't know this when I got it, but if the Garmin is plugged in and not using battery power, it automatically turns on when the car is turned on (that's what I get for not reading the instruction manual, lol).To have a cleaner appearance in the car, I have the mini-usb plugged into the ball mount that is holding the GPS and not plugged into the GPS itself.  Unfortunately, that port is really close to the ball mount which restricts it's movement when plugged in.  With the adapter, it makes the cable less intrusive and makes the GPS free to adjust with the ball mount to nearly any position desired.  In combination with a 1.50 mini-usb cable, probably the cheapest way to keep my Nuvi charged while driving!!"}

They were easy to set up and since they are both from the same manufacturer they both use the same charger so I do not have any extra ones to worry about and I always have a spare to take with me when I am gone for long periods of time.The only suggestions that I would have would be for a positive connection to my iTouch; as it is now it is too easy to wiggle out just enough so that the connection is not good and I have to push it back in.Of course this only happens when I am walking it works great when I am just lounging around listening to tunes."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this headphones from local storepairing is not hard with laptopthe control layout is a lot like Motorola HT820 (vol and call/power switch are on the left; play and prev/next are on the right)the RF is OK, pretty much like Logitechthe problem is sound in hifi mode, it sounds like CD player has Mega Bass turned on, bass is over-emphasized on some partthe headphone is pretty comfortable to wearI give score of 88/100, the sound in hifi mode is not good as expected, also, AVRCP is kinda sluggish"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Looks very cool.  Very convenient charging via USB port.  Not so good sound quality.  Audio has a lot of static tics and pops and that is the only reason I give this 2 stars.  Everything else is great.Pairs quickly with my Nextel i870.I lost my Plantronics 510, so will fall back to this unit until I can find the latest earpiece that has received good reviews.  Other may have a great experience with this earpiece.  Unfortunately, I am not one of them.  Maybe I got a \"bad\" one."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got this to use my 5g iPod with my BT-3030 BT adapter.I got this over the 125s because I can potentially use this with anything that has a 3.5mm jack. And the 125s looked a bit fragile.At least with my BT-3030 it works very well.  It doesn't have a lot of range (40 feet at most line of sight) but that's not my concern.Only downsides are no user replaceable battery and it only charges with USB.  It'd be nice if it doubled as a USB to BT dongle for the PC, but oh well.It's a lot smaller than I thought it'd be.  So small in fact that Jabra should consider making an iPod sleeve with a a120s pocket attached. (are you listening Jabra?)The other minor issue is that when it's fully charged, the power button/indicator LED changes green, but not always.  Sometimes it'll go green after an hour sometimes after 10.I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to use a simple universal BT transmitter."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I use this transmitter on the back of my tv with my Bluetooth headphones. It works perfectly for my purpose and the battery lasts pretty long, given the size of this thing. It's really small, smaller than a matchbox even. Charges up in about 2 hours and will go for a couple weeks, with an hour or two of use per day. I did have some problems trying to get this thing to pair, it's looks as if there are no buttons, don't worry, it's there. The light is also the button, on the opposite side of the USB charging port, and the audio cable. Once you play with this thing for a little while will make you a pro at it. Then you'll have no problems. I definitely recommend this little transmitter."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This device is pretty simple, plug it in, hold the button to pair and thats pretty much it. It works fine with theJabra BT620s Headphonesand does its job well, but my only complaint is that it seems to suffer from some interference every now and then that some of my other Bluetooth devices don't.Please note well that this is just a minor quibble, and the overall performance is superb. The device comes with a USB-A to USB-Mini-B cable (pretty standard) and will charge via any USB port. I get between 8-12 hours of use per charge.Note: This will only work with headsets that support the A2DP profile. It does not have a regular Mono headset profile."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I just purchased this device, and use it with a Motorola V365 cell phone (AT&T). Although the quality of the sound may not equal that of your land line phone, or maybe even your cell phone under ideal conditions, it is excellent.  The people with whom I have spoken say that I sound fine, and I am pleased with how they sound. There is absolutely no issue with the volume. Based on my experience, I am comfortable saying that for the price,  you will be very happy with the Blue Ant."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Very convenient product to have that allows for easy movement from one vehicle to the next.  The speaker quality is good and the ability to shift the microphone to a different angle is a nice touch.  I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't consistently automatically connect to the LG enV phone after pairing the two devices together.  Sometimes if I try to make a call via voice dial, it won't activate the phones voice dial feature like it should when I press the Answer/End button.  Overall the product is a good product, but LG enV buyers beware of the inconsistencies."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The voice quality of Blueant Supertooth II is better than my factory installed Cadillac Bluetooth phone. Amazingly powerful speakerphone in such a small package. The listeners at the other end, who used to complain of muffled voice from my built in Cadillac Bluetooth phone, can now hear clearly and sometime have hard time believing that I am calling from handsfree phone. It sticks very securely to the magnetic attachment for the visor. Construction is a little bit like cheap Chinese products Because the metal cover for my on/off switch fell off on the first day. But overall it is a good product and you will be pleased at its performance.Update 4/29/2008: The speaker stopped working after a week. BlueAnt said the product is discontinued and they will replace with Supertooth Light"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The WEP200 sounds pretty good, is easy to use and is pleasantly small, but the system for keeping it in the ear is nearly useless. It comes with three different sizes of these little rubber loop things that are supposed to create enough pressure and friction on the inside of the auricle to keep the device in place, but none of them would keep the little thing in my ear, it would always fall out.It comes with nice a little case that also serves as the charger.  However, this device also a little bit overpriced. So, on to the next one."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my 4th bluetooth headset, and I'm getting frustrated trying to find one that both works good and fits good. This one works great, but frankly I don't understand why that can't design one that is comfortable to wear.Once you figure out how it is supposed to be worn, it isn't too bad, however I can only wear it about an hour at a time. Most of the time I keep it in my shirt pocket, and put it in my ear when my phone rings.I'm keeping it, because it works better than all the other ones. Just don't understand why they don't make them like earbud headset."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This was a very nice bluetooth headset until I lost it. since it so small, I tuck it away and now I can't find it ;(. anyways, I had 2 great headset by Plantronics and samsung. both are very good, but if I had to choose, I would choose Samsung for it connects to my phone without too much hassle compare to plantronics 510 voyager, where I had to constantly reset my phone to get connect it. on the other hand Plantronics Voyager 510 voice is far superior to Samsungs (IMO)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This bluetooth headset is tiny compared to others I've researched. I purchased it for my daughter, and she loves it.  It paired easily with her Env2 Verizon phone.  I called her to test it and I could hear her clearly and she reports she can hear well on it too. There was no feedback noise or echo.  She reports that it is very comfortable, and she has been wearing it for long periods of time without a problem.  The standby time is 70 hours, so it doesn't have to be constantly charging. Great product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First, the ear clip snapped around the clip that holds it on. Hmm, OK, I'll replace it.EVERY time that I tried to answer a call with that wondrous \"one button wonder\" I disconnected or worse, couldn't hear it loud enough. for whatever Allen Funt reason, this !#!@?!! thing resets to the lowest audio setting all by itself. It doesn't fit into my ear(s) but sort of hangs over it on that damned cheap earpiece that never held right. Pretty much guaranteed to be a worse distraction while driving than picking up the phone itself: distractingly nonfunctional and some engineer's idea of punking everybody who buys it.This was a replacement for my lost Samsung headset that was a much better product, but gone, darn it. As such, I've relegated THIS absurd farce to a place on a shelf until I can conveniently find a way to extract some measure of revenge on it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Expected a small earphone based on reviews but was still surprised at it's tiny size when first looking at it up close.Medium ear \"hook\" worked for me - suggest playing with this (removing the rubber hook and adjusting it on the ear piece) until getting right fit - the bud goes in ear and added loop of rubber is supposed to counter against the curve in another part of your outer ear - genius design imho and when this thing is in, even jumping up and down or shaking your head or tapping your head (yes tried that too, silly I know...) will not dislodge this.Paired easily with a samsung ach930, sound is great and the other side of the call is also impressed, no complaints of echo or static.Have a plantronics 510 which is good, this wep200 is smaller yet compares in quality to the plantronics."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's 2nd headset I had.  I used to have Moto HS850.  WEP200 is better as far as connection; way to operate it.  Easy to carry it around.  It doesn't solid stay in my ear even I used the largest loop. So I won't always put it in my ear, only when there is a call. The voice is clear in in-door or inside the car with windows up.  Noise cancelling is not as good as HS850.  When I walk on the street in a little windy climate, the other party start complaining the noise.  This is what Samsung needs to find the way to improve it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The first thing I noticed with the Samsung WEP200 when I first connected it to my Treo 750 was how fast it connected and how great the quality was.I have owned many Bluetooth Headsets and most of them had unusable static or they would not connect to my device in a timely fashion or even connect after the unit was in standby for long periods of time.The WEP200 connects quickly and the sound quality is superb.People on the other end can't even tell I am on a Bluetooth headset.The earpiece fits into my ear snugly and is fairly comfortable for about a few hours and then it gets a bit on the sore side. I wish there was some sort of necklace dongle where it could be placed and taken off when needed.Its small and very light and the range is excellent.Very highly recommended."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought the BLT-04 case to use with the Motorola H700 headset.  It fits the headset very nicely, but..  But, the design of the case does not prevent the  multifunction button from being pushed if the case is at all squeezed, even though there is a recess in the case cover you'd think would prevent that.  The result is that I'd often find the pairing light on and the battery close to drained.If you are going to clip the case on a shirt pocket, it might be ok, though even the tension of the elastic of the case is enough to push the headset button.  If the case will be put inside a briefcase or purse, then you should probably reconsider."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had seen reviews by folks who had problems with this unit, but tried it anyway as the price was great.The initial charge took less than the 6 hours stated in the documentation, but I've been using it for a week and haven't needed to recharge it as of yet.The reviewer who recommended using the foam cover was absolutely right.  It eliminates most of the background or wind noise.  The unit stays on my ear reliably.  I use the included ear hook.While the output from the microphone could be a little better, I don't have to speak excessively loudly to use it.The LEDs are needlessly bright, but since I don't see them when the unit is on my ear, this is not a big deal."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Well, I went ahead and bought this at the reduced price. It was good at first and then other people were having problems hearing me and I was misunderstood because of this headset. Thankfully, it wasn't one of my important calls and just resulted in a bit of confusion between that person and me. I am returning this product because it is just not worth it to me if the other person cannot hear me properly. I do like the design of it and the fact that you get to choose how you place it in your ear. I don't care about it otherwise."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After a small amount of screwing around the H500 connected with myNokia N75 without a hitch.  I find that if you firmly place the earloop around the base of the ear and then fold in the receiver in fitsfirmly and doesn't come loose.  I agree that the volume could go higher;however, in a quiet room it is adequate.  I'm told that I'm clearlyheard on the other end of the connection.  This is also in a quiet room.Small and lite.  I think this a rather nifty piece of gear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really like the design but keep in mind you are sacrificing protection for aesthetics. It really only covers the back of the phone which in my opinion is the least important part. The screen is largely unprotected except for a slight lip around the edge which may or may not protect the screen but I have yet to drop it.You really have to press fairly hard on the buttons to elicit a response which gets annoying after a while. I solved this by cutting the button part out with an exacto knife.I have a otterbox style case for this as well but it adds too much bulk to an already large phone so this is my go-to case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is made of a firmer material than the silicone cases, which is perfect because it doesn't stretch or get caught when going in or out of a pocket or case.  It hugs the phone tight enough that many people won't know you have a case on it.  At first I thought the case was making button use difficult, but then I took the case off and realized the Galaxy Note buttons are terrible even without a case.  It's not much more difficult with the case on, and you do get used to it.  The textured grip area on the sides is a nice tough as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Pros:  Works as it should. Easy connection to the phone.  Good talk time. Comfortable fit on the ear.  Easy to use.One Con: I could use this headset without any problems. My wife would get bad echo issues where the person she was talking with heard themselves as an echo.  Guess it has to do with the fit to the ear.  In my case the path from the earpiece to the mike was blocked but open in her case.  She had the same issue with a Motorola H500 earpiece and i can use the same Motorola earpiece fine.Purchased a Plantronics 510 which works for her.  No reports of echo from the person she is talking with."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my 4th bluetooth headset, and it is by far the best working headset. It is clear. I can hear while driving, people can hear me like I am talking into the phone.My one complaint is that it doesn't fit well on my ear. If they had made the ear loop another 1/4\" I would be giving this 5 stars. Instead it never feels exactly right, and ends up hurting my ear if I wear it for extended periods.I'm keeping it, but I am looking for a different way to attach it to my ear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Product came without shipping slip, no protective packaging. .Bluetooth was placed in a plastic bag, slipped in an envelope and mailed.  Quality is very poor.  Crackling, buzzing muffled sounds very annoying and diapointing to recieve something you are expecting to use all the time to not being able to use it.  I would not recomend this vendor to anyone.  Description stated very clearly that it would be packaged in retai packaged and pictured with extra items.  This came with bluetooth only and charge cord; no instruction or any other accessories with this."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently, which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous. I could have bought a 520 for $2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really don't have a lot of time. That is why I shop online, So if I'm purchasing an item that is to be used to make life more convenient, like a Bluetooth headset, it really is obnoxious to receive one that is &#34;worse than sucks&#34;. This item did not even charge. Plantronics really needs to pull this item because it is really damaging to their reputation to have this out there for sale. I choose Plantronics because as a Regional Sales Manager/Road Warrior, I've always had luck with Plantronics. Too bad that this one was a lemon."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I like this bluetooth mainly because of the fit.  I find it stays comfortably in your ear and doesn't easily fall off.  I previously bought a Motorola blue tooth and dropped it about 5 days after I got it, I could no longer get a connection to my phone and pretty much threw it out.  I have dropped this about 2 times already and it still works fine.  I like that you can easily rotate to put on your other ear because I cannot handle something in my ear for too long. The sound quality is not perfect but I think it is great for the price. I bought one for each of my family members."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Plantronics is a world leader in ear-piece peripherals. They manufacture every imaginable headsets from telephone to gaming. The Explorer 330 fits the bill to supplement a bluetooth cellphone and its ease of use and functionality is way superior to a lot of bluetooth headphones out there. I have had mine for about 2 years now and has always worked great. Pairing is not a problem for this headset, once the pairing is recorded in the phone, there are no quirks about pairing it when you need to use it. Distance-wise, it does not conform to the 33ft maximum, but on a personal note, I hardly part the headset with the phone in that distance so it hardly matters according to my intended use. Overall happy with this headset as it has exceeded my expectations to great lengths!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Picked this up when it was on sale and I must admit that it works great. Fits well and stays put. Sound is crisp. I've received no complaints from people on the other end of the call. The battery holds up well. And it's easy to use. Used with an iPhone and Blackberry with no issues.Update: This headset has lastest quite a while with a lot of use. I sit on daily conferences, and this is always in my ear during the conferences. It's comfortable and lightweight. The sound is still great (on both ends). And no issues with durability!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Explorer 350 is simple to set up and use.  Here's my lowdown:Positive:- easy set up and use- good sound- balances well on the ear and easy to put on- nice options charging in car or via a USB port- nice options for mounting it in the car- nice phone ringing tone in the earpieceNegatives:- no built-in mute function (that I can find)- if you want to recharge via outlet, you have to purchase a chargerThis is my second Plantronics bluetooth headset.  The first (Voyager) had all the bells as whistles, but the buttons were very small and the volume button broke when I dropped it on a tile floor.  This one is easier to adjust on the fly but you have to be willing to live with no mute."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Of all the various brands of bluetooth headsets I've purchased, all of the Plantronics products seem to offer the best value for the dollar.  I have purchased other headsets from Sennheiser, BlueAnt, Trek, Jawbone, Pioneer, Sony, Motorola, and god knows who else. Plantronics has been the ONLY brand that I've been a repeat customer of.  I've gotten the same sound quality out of this $20something headset as I did from the $140+ Jawbone and $160+ Sennheiser!  My advice, simple, order this or any Plantronics headset, take the change and get some new games or apps on that fancy Android handset..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This was worth the price,earpiece volume is great, no problem hearing incoming voice.  The only problem is that the mic is so far away from my mouth (as a result of such a compact product), that in order to have good voice transmission, I must hold my hand up and \"cup\" it from the corner of my mouth to the earpiece so my voice can be heard clearly.  This product would be perfect if it the mic portion extended a couple inches further towards the mouth."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've tried both the Motorola HS810 and the Treo bluetooth headsets, and this by far is the best one. The problem with Motorola is that it doesn't synch with the Treo 650 100% of the time; while the Treo headset has very poor volume (I need to be in a quiet room to hear anything). The Cardo Scala 700 has great fit (it sits right over the ear canal), great volume (even when driving with windows down), and it synchs with the Treo 650 all the time. This is the headset I'd recommend for anyone with the Treo 650."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was concerned after ordering this device, when I read many reviews that said this device was a cheap piece of plastic that didn't fit into their ear properly. When I opened the packaged and first put it in my ear, I thought \"oh no - they were right!\"But I then read the manual and after adjusting the \"ear loop\" and angling the headset slightly downward, it fit perfectly into my ear! It's snug, it doesn't flop around at all. It fits in a different way from your traditional \"ear plug\" device but in many ways it's more comfortable because it's not sitting in your outer ear canal but slightly further outside.So if you're thinking about ordering this device, I'd recommend buying it. Just spend a little time getting the fit right and read the manual about how to adjust the ear loop which makes a huge difference.(Functionally the product paired with my Cingular Hermes 8525 phone perfectly - sound quality is fine)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Overall, its a good set of headphones. Ive owned quite a few sets of bt headphones and by far i still dont think any are better than the Moto HT 820 setThe jog dials are good and handy, and they are comfy on the ears. they already send you the case with them too so dont buy it optional. They wont tell you this when ordering hoping that you will pitch them more money...They are also a little on the large side. If you purchase you will get cracked on for looking like DJ Khaled( Just giving heads up. the ht 820's that moto makes are the best ive ever owned. above any.But for the money these a great fit ....enjoy"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love this device - it's the only one that allows you to plug in your own headset. And I am VERY HAPPY to report that it works perfectly with the Verizon XV6800 Smartphone (also known as the HTC 6800 or Mogul 6800 on Sprint). No one reviewing here had tried it with this device, but I wanted the functionality so I took a chance and ordered it anyway. It works perfectly! (Or what I've tried so far works perfectly - I haven't received any phone calls while listening to music yet.)Note that I'm running Windows Mobile 6.1. I think it may not work for devices running WM 6.0. The audio jack functionality was altered with the OS upgrade. It may work, though - can't say for sure. It's worth trying!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've found that these are by far the best method for clipping my phone to my belt, I've used others many more expensive but always come back to one of these because of their built in kickstand and ability to easily and quickly slide the phone out.They're cheap yes but I've never had any problems with durability except after a long time of use, much longer you would expect such a cheap piece of plastic to last, that and on the ones with the kickstands like this that locking mechanism eventually wears out but the whole thing is easily replaceable.I have at times knocked the phone out my holster when bumping up against something but that is the tradeoff you pay for not having a lock obstructing your access to the device."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I gave this product a 3 because the clip easily broke off. the case is good which comes in two parts. A hard shell phone case is fits really well and you can use it just like that plus a sliding cover with a clip. The cover works like a screen protector and keeps scratches from the screen. The only bad side is since the phone is big and when you clip it on your belt, the clip snaps off its place when you sit down. 2 occasions my phone fell on a taxi seat because the clip detached it self from the case. If I was not watchful i could have lost my phone. From that time on i keep my phone in my back pocket"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It seems that, to date, no one has really created a durable holster for the Note 2, but this one is the best so far. The new lip at the bottom of the unit keeps the phone from falling out while holstered (Yup, other designs have had that problem). The belt clip seems more durable as well. I've owned at least a few different designs of Note 2 holsters now, and I've broken them all by simple actions like accidentally catching the unit on a door jam.This unit has held up better in the past week or so that I've had it (Yup, broke'm in less than a week prior). It's easier to retrieve the phone with the sleek design than some other bulkier, soft-rubber cases. I like it so far."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this case from my girlfriend and her new Samsung Galaxy S4.  She had been using an Otterbox Commuter but was dissatisfied with that case's bulk.  I'm a big fan of TPU cases, so I got her this one and she couldn't be happier with it.  It fits snugly, looks great, covers the buttons (big plus), and isn't so bulky.  While this case is not at all bulky, it still offers protection for the camera lens and screen by having tiny ridges surrounding those parts which keep them from coming into contact with the surface the rest of the phone is resting on.  The fact that this case is so inexpensive just adds to its otherwise perfect rating."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The mix of smooth and ridged surfaces is a nice touch aesthetically and it also helps to keep a nice grip as all smooth can be a bit slippery. The case fits like a glove and all the holes and cuts outs fit the various ports perfectly. The price on this item is hard to beat and it arrived quickly. I haven't tried it with any of the fun NFC features yet, but I'm not anticipating any problems.All in all, if you're looking for a nice, simple bumper case I suggest you look no further (assuming the price is still good)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Fits like a glove. Adds no bulk to the phone - my GS4 stays slim and light!The kickstand works, doesn't slide around, nice and firm. It clicks shut with two tiny tabs of plastic on either end of the kickstand, so I guess if over time those tabs break then it won't stay shut anymore. But for the moment, the tabs are really tiny and hopefully will not break anytime soon.The only downsides I can find are:a. hard to feel whether or not if you pressed the power/volume button or not, there's no tactile feedback when you push. They do work though.b. the screw(?) that holds the kickstand in place on the back of the case bulges out and makes the phone sit slightly lopsided when you put it on a flat surface facing upward. Not an issue for me, but didn't expect the screw to bulge out the way it does.Otherwise very satisfied."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Shows up totally deformed (top of the case doesn't even touch the phone because it was cast crooked), and I have to pay to mail it back to them if I want a replacement? I don't want a replacement anymore, I want a functional phone case. Definitely a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; kind of thing. The case is pretty inflexible, so when I took the case off, it also pulled off the back of the phone. Not the end of the world, but definitely a crappy case. Would absolutely not recommend."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this case and the Incipio SA-378 DualPro Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 .  This is cheaper... and does the job... but looks a bit cheap compared to this amazing S4 slick phone.  I like the lip to protect the screen.  The buttons work fine and the ports are good.  It is grippy but slides in and out of my pocket fine.  It seems to give ok protectionI think the Incipio case gives better protection, looks much more sophisticated and isn't appreciably thicker.  It costs twice as much...but still is cheap.  I have a dock for my S4.  I had to modify the Incipio by cutting around the hole for the USB... I did not have to modify for the boxwave."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchase quite a few things from Amazon.com so I figured I would start writing reviews again especially for the products I end up having to send back to Amazon for Defects or just not working properly.Unfortunately this is one of those products, its okay but with a few defects  and I can&#8217;t recommend this product it is not very good IMOPros:1. Great coverage of back and sides for protection, cut outs line up perfect.2. Pretty thin, doesn&#8217;t add much bulk.3. Glossy sides add a little better grip.Cons:1. Made my screen protector bubble up on sides2. Very slippery on back but glossy bumper on the sides, helps make grip better, could be better.3. Power button is near impossible to press with case installed (Deal Breaker)4. Pretty Plain"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this case because it was very cheap.  I should have known it was not worth it.  The case fit is too tight.  When I put it on my phone, the lip that goes around the front of the phone was uneven.  No matter how many times I tried to take it off and put it back on again, the lip was just uneven.  This caused my screen protector film to be displaced by this case.  It was much more of a pain than a help.  Get the real Samsung case and save yourself the headache."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Beautifully designed case.  It provides great TPU protection without adding bulk to the phone.  It fits great, nice and snug so you don't have to worry about it ever coming off on its own, while still able to remove if needed.  The color is stunning on the black phone, a nice deep jewel tone.  The sides provide nice grip, and I love the matte back.  The only issue is how difficult the power and volume buttons are to press, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.  I would buy more if it came in more colors."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Even though I am not a fan of cases I still try them to see what are good and if I can come to keeping one....my preference still says no to cases but that's a gamble I take again, since dropping my S4 before andresulted in my screen breaking...that could of been avoided if i had a case on it.Slowly my trust and confidence in not dropping my phone has gone back up...but I'm taking risks and youshould protect yourself from having a broken or damaged phone.The case is pretty much all clear except the back is a matt white finish. Gives it a bit of a cool edge to it.The case is a bit too snug and a bit molded fatter on some parts of the trimming but the entire phoneis covered fine with the case. If I dropped it, I believe it will be saved but every drop is risky regardless..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This battery is for my super old Moto V3 phone that I am using as secondary phone. this is my 3rd battery on the phone since i bought it many years ago. (wow the phone is still working) anyway, it gave 6-7 days of stand by time. I am using the phone to recive SMS only. I am not really using it for calling much now.But when I was using it actively for few weeks (after my primary phone broke down) it gave me solid 4.5 days of calling and texting time. Not bad... really... I can recomend this battery strongly.S."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Even though my Nokida model, 6126, was listed as working when this arrived I thought oh-man they shipped the wrong thing. Then I looked at the model number on the cable and it was the one I ordered. Then I thought oh man I ordered the wrong thing.Turns out it works even though all the connections do not seem to match, it is secure, and actually have a very high transfer rate. So if you get it out and it doesn't seem like it would fit, play with it until it snaps in and it probably will work for you if your model is listed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This arrived in what appeared to be a Nokia retail package, and had Nokia insignia on the cable. It appeared to be genuine. The package lists only a few Nokia phones by number, then says \"and compatible phones\". Orientation of the unique Nokia plug (?POP) is not obvious and the plug does not go in easily(until it's perfectly lined up). For my 6126 the plug needs to be oriented with the Nokia insignia to the front of the phone. Once connected the cable worked perfectly."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am sure this cable works fantastically.As long as it is used with the correct phone. I should have know better, but the price was so incredibly low- especailly having originally purchased the correct cable from Nokia 2 years ago for fifty bucks- that I felt, even if my phone was not listed, hey, it could still work, right?Wrong. But in an effort to write a 'helpful' review I have to add, it is in fact an OEM Nokia CA-52 cable, it was very inexpensive, and it arrived much sooner than expected."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When installed according to instructions, this unit fulfills all its claims.NOTE that for the best success, you should separate the external antenna and internal base unit by as much distance and signal-obstruction as possible -- put the outdoor antenna at at the best available signal location, and the indoor base unit in the worst dead-zone.  Use every inch of the 50' cable supplied.My installation is in a steel-framed and steel-skinned building -- getting a signal inside was basically impossible. The outside antenna is on an old TV antenna mast 5' above the building roof, and the inside unit is sitting on top of a suspended ceiling in the center of the main area. Now I get 5-bars on Sprint anywhere inside the building, and 3-4 bars within 10 feet or so of the building outside. Our ATT data card gets a 5-bars signal also. (We are thus using both bands on this unit at once.)While not cheap, it is the least expensive alternative available, and It Just Works(tm)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We got this for my son to use on his job as he drives all day long.  He uses it for keeping in contact while on the road and the hands free operation is the only way to go.  The Bluetooth syncing and operation is very easy to set up and the connection is good.  The battery also has a good life and he needs it as some days are long ones for him.The sound quality is good and he can hear the caller clearly and we can hear him well.  The price we paid was a lot less that the $40 they are asking here.  I only mention this as he goes through Bluetooth ear pieces quite frequently from daily use, to breaking them to simply losing them.We gave him a really good stereo set that he uses at home and to listen books and music but he uses the lower priced ones while he is on the road.  This Jabra is reasonable quality and performance for the money."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the 4th one of these I have owned, first one from Amazon. The first one I gave away to a friend, who forgot to plug in their phone more than I do, the next two I ran through the laundry machine (don't do that). I can't live with out this thing... well... if I can live with out my phone, I might be able to live with out this, which I hear one can live with out a phone, but I am unwilling to test this. How else can you steal the batteries from the TV remote to charge your phone as you run out the door for work?!? Yeah, its just that cool!Bottom line, will everyone need one, no, just those of us that have forgotten to plug in their phone, or have been talking on our phone all day and have yet another important call to make, or can't find their charger in there suit case despite KNOWING you packed it or... you get the idea."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this with the intention of using it with my vast supply of rechargeable AA's, however to my surprise I discovered that it would only work with non-rechargeable batteries.  In fact it wouldn't even work with brand new Duracell Alkaline AA's.  Apparently it will only work with Energizers, though I'm not sure how that's technically possible.  As often as I would expect to use this to recharge my Evo Shift when I'm out an about, I would be buying and throwing away an awful lot of non rechargeable batteries, which isn't very cost effective and isn't great for the environment.  It works pretty well with the supplied Energizers that come with it, and it does have both Micro and Mini USB connectors, but because of the limitations it only rates 3 stars from me."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This product works great, my phone died on a camping trip, and I had bought 2 of these. They charged it so I could talk on the phone and text on the way back. I use the Eneloop rechargeable batteries so I can recharge them after I use them.The other reviewer does not understand that his cell phone battery can store more energy than 2AA batteries. These chargers will add a couple hours of talk time but not fully charge your phone. If you need to fully charge your phone I would suggest a normal charger because these would take too many batteries for normal use.I love these chargers, and will always keep one in my car. They have saved me more than once."}

Well, I've been swapping back and forth between my original and this one for a few weeks now (to make sure they stay charged) and I can never tell the difference in life, they both seem to work exactly the same. The only difference is this one has a non-OEM looking sticker wrapping it, looks to be printed from a scan of an OEM."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased these about 8 weeks ago for use at work.  So far, here's my experience:+ Positives ++ Loooooooong battery life+ Comfortable enough to wear 6+ hours at a time+ Good sound quality+ Easy controls for volume, etc+ Around $30.  One of the cheapest I've found for bluetooth headset+ Noise cancellation works...if you have music going (why have them on if you don't!)- Negatives -- Wall charger that came with them was a MICRO usb charger, not the MINI usb charger that it requires.  However, I had plenty of mini usb cables, which I used to charge them with from my PCOverall, these bluetooth headphones are and excellent value - would definitely recommend...especiall for the $30.Final note, these do not come \"packaged.\"  They arrive in your box inside of a plastic bag with the wall charger (probably the wrong type), the headphones, and the \"manual\"."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I do a lot of freeway driving and I've tried 2 of these speaker phones with myTreo and the noise cancellation feature is poor. It works fine below 45 mph but the faster I go the more my callers complain about the road noise. Also you have to turn off Bluetooth on the phone when you turn off the speaker phone. The phone thinks it's still connected to the speaker phone,it will show that it's not connected to any Bluetooth devise but keeps the phone mic and speaker on mute until Bluetooth is turned off."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Was skeptical that I would actually receive a $3 car charger for my iPhone4 that works, but it does! Plugged it in and it started charging immediately. The cord is long enough that it can be used while charging, but not so long that it gets in the way (if you are using any type of windshield/dash mount the cord may not be long enough depending on where your outlet is located). I rarely ever use a car charger as my iPhone sits in a charging cradle all day at work, so if it only lasts for a few charges, it's well worth $3."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have an Android based phone, so I had to buyMotorola Mini-USB to Micro-USB Charger Adapterto go along with it. I know, the secondary item is cheap, so no biggie, right? Well, trust me...you will lose the adapter before you find yourself needing to use the portable charger. It's just human nature, right? We lose things. So yes, the charger works...but you'd better find a darn good spot to store the adapter, or the portable charger will be useless.Instead, might I suggest you purchaseMotorola Universal Dual-Charging Portable Power Pack - Black - Retail Packaging. It's not too much more expensive, and will be more likely to be useful to you in the event of an emergency."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I thought this item was going to be compatible with my Motorola Droid Razr, but it is not - it comes up as compatible in a search and I didn't notice it saying the connection was mini, not micro. So that is my fault for not paying closer attention to the specs. I could buy an adapter, but instead I decided to give it to my son for his bluetooth headset as it is a mini usb connection.It does work as described, (though just not for anything that uses a micro connection) and is a very reasonable price. It's small and easy to put in a pocket or purse, and is very convenient. When I got my Razr, my son got my old Chocolate Touch, so I gave him the headset also and he uses it all of the time. He's used the charger twice now and it works as described."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got this because there are times when I need my Blackberry to be functional and I'm not near a charger.  I hadn't tried the P790 yet when hurricane Irene decided to pay a visit.  I had the unit charged up when the power went out Saturday before 9pm.  By 4pm the next day, power had not been restored and the phone was going below 20% & wanted to shut down some functioning to conserve what was left of the battery life.  I attached the P790 with an adaptor I bought at the same time.  In under an hour I was at 55% battery life and could keep going normally till I had an opportunity to do a normal charge at my office, later that evening.  It'd be an understatement to say I'm pleased."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a pretty solid case.  It's very stiff so it's almost a hard case, but is still flexible.  Should protect well if it gets dropped.Both sides are the same so the scanner can go into either side and the cable into the other.  The scanner is slightly higher than one side of the case.  There's a padded flap in between the halves of the case that pushes into the other half a bit.  That compresses the cable in the other side and makes it so nothing moves around.Functionally, that's a great design, but for looks I would have liked the scanner to fit completely into the bottom, with a thinner top half for the cable.  As it stands I might be able to get a couple other cables or things into the top part so it's probably a net plus."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "In truth, I am glad I bought this case in the event that I need to store or travel with my scanner.  However, I don't see myself taking my scanner anywhere.  Since I bought my scanner, it has been next to my computer and I don't really see the need to take it anywhere.One thing I am curious about is that the case has 2 sides with elastic and only one scanner fits inside, so I can't figure out why 2.  Anyway, it is just an observation because it doesn't affect the fact that the slim scanner fits great in it and protects it well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "At less than a dollar per sheet, you can afford to treat them as disposable and not be too upset if they fall off or lose their ability to stay on that long. What sells the screen protectors for me is that they come with a grid on the backing so you can easily measure and quickly cut to match the size of the LCD you're protecting. If you want something more permanent, then go with Invisible Shield or Best Skins Ever. But for the price and their versatility, they're well worth it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love these because they have done an excellent job of protecting my phone screens on ALL my phones! What's great about these is they have line and numbers, a grid that's formed to help you make a better, smarter cut for your mobile's screen. I even give these as gifts because people don't realize how much you touch your screen. It needs to be protectedThese are the best and I will continue to use these and search for larger sizes. These are the ones that should be on everyone's list. Great stocking stuffers as well!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "You can use this product to cut a high quality screen protector for anything with a touchscreen. That's awesome. Keep in mind that you have to cut and apply the screen protector yourself. It took me a few applications before I got good at it. Some air bubbles are normal, they dissipate after a few days. Lots of air bubbles means you are doing it wrong. Practice makes perfect.  You get 10 screen protectors for about $10.00 (or whatever they are selling it for) and the sheets they give you are pretty large. I think this is product is a very good value."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Mobile service providers claim that this type of antenna does not work, and I have to agree with them.  Installing it actually reduced my reception from 2 bars to NO bars!  If you search the internet, you will find that passive antennas like this are no different than that battery compartment sticker that claimed to improve cell phone reception, block radio waves from frying your brain, etc.  It doesn't work and it's a waste of money.I recommend buying a wired antenna that directly connects to your phone.  If you phone doesn't have such a connection, then you may want to look into a different phone because nothing without a direct connection is going to work, and you may want to look into a phone that gets better reception (there are some -- just read the 3rd party reviews).I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you just have money to burn.  If so, please just send it to my PayPal account instead."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Had zero effect. My windows must already allow enough signal through for this to not make a difference. Bought it for the back of my place because I get full bars right outside on the patio, and almost none inside (I live in a concrete apartment). If I put the phone in the same place I had this, I get good reception, but this didn't extend my signal any, or act as a repeater. Didn't seem to help in the car either, but I don't really need it there."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought 2 of these antenna's. I gave one to a friend and kept one for my self. Me and my Friend both put then on a Window to help with reception. I use a Motorola Q and my Friend has an I Phone both of us has service though Verizon. We went from either no service or 1 bar of service to 2 to 3 bars. I also have a Virgin Mobile MI FI Internet Data Card and it helped to increase my service from either no bar or 1 bar or service to 2 to 3 bars or service. Both of us live i rural area's. I would highly recommend this antenna to any one who has problems with cell reception. It also helps with Cordless Phones (if using the phone outside and Home Wireless(WI FI) network if using a lop top outside. You could use it on your car or a window at home."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is works and is cheap so I am still giving it a few stars, but I feel it is a little bit of tricky advertising and the item is not as one would expect.When you scrutinize the description it does state \"Brushed Aluminum Back Cover\" which I took to mean the cover is aluminum.  What it truly means is that the case is clear plastic and a little brushed aluminum plate has been glued only to the back.  In the picture it appears the entire case is aluminum which is what I really wanted, but not so. The case is clear plastic all around the sides and only metal on back. I'm not sure what the purpose of making only the back aluminum except to keep it low cost, but as anyone purchasing this is probably expecting a metal case it is a let down over all.P.S. The case is slippery."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this case because of the descriptions and the price. I have a white HTC One and it really looked good on it and didn't add much bulk or weight to the phone. I tried to take it 1 step too far and remove the plastic back to make it a bumper (since that was I was looking for anyway) but it's not firm enough to be a bumper. If you're happy with the looks and don't destroy it like I did, you'll live this one. I'm still using it as a bumper but did order the clear version of this same make/model."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Ok so i wish i felt i could give this 4-5 stars but 2 things really bug me, 1st and most annoying is the power button becomes recessed wit this case , the volume buttons have an extended piece that makes them ez to access but the power button doesnt, and 2nd the top and bottom seem to bow out a little and not quite fit almost like maybe a bad batch cause it is close really close but it bows out. so i love the look and feel, it shows off this pone. keeps the sleek curves. oh i wish that power button where easier to hit and it would be a case i really like."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Awesome Cover for a gorgeous phone. I have a HTC one in Blue and needed a good cover while actually showing off the blue beauty. This cover does it all. I kind of wished it to be clear on the back too rather than the frosting ( which make a good design ) because my blue HTC still somewhat hides in it. Other than that, for the price, it's got a great grip, and a sturdy feeling. I love Boxwave for all its extraordinary accessories. You can never go wrong with this purchase!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am no expert on these headsets, this is the first one I have ever bought. That being said, I think this one is great. I have a Samsung phone and I was never really pleased with the way the mic picked up my voice and often people would complain of not being able to hear me but with this made my voice clear and understandable. I was worried of the background noise by the nature of the bluetooth but the AudioIQ seems to do an excellent job keeping the noise out, not sure how. It is simple to set up as well. Overall I am really pleased with this. Highly Recommended!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have owned 2 Plantronics headsets -- The 665 and its predecessor, the 655. Both have suffered the same fate. The little rubber ear tips are flimsy and keep breaking. When I pick up the headset, the ear tip falls out. I purchased the ear tip replacement pack, which costs about $10 and you get 3 ear tips -- 1 small, 1 medium, and 1 large. Given that I only have a need for 1 size, I basically had to pay $10 for one ear tip... which broke after 30 days. The headset sounds pretty good, fits in my ear OK, and people say they can hear me pretty well. Despite all of these positives, I will be replacing it with another brand."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My first impression is that whoever designed this product must have liked Kinder eggs when they were younger: everything involves assembly, and the car charger looks like something out of a Bond movie. Although I didn't have any issues with the call quality, the biggest problem was the plastic hoop that connect the headset to your ear - it's flimsy, breaks off easily in your pocket, and isn't particularly comfortable.It's definitely not bad for the price, but I don't think it stands up well to the Motorola range. If you spend a little more, you can get a little more comfort and considerably fewer attachments."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I guess it depends on your phone, even though this cable says it works with the shine, there is no shine driver on the cd. without the proper driver you cannot proceed. I don't think it's the cable at all, which is working very well at charging the phone. I did hunt around and downloads the drivers, the phone then shows up as removable f:...sometimes....but not in Windows Media Player and I could not get any music to transfer, I kept getting I/O device error.By the same token I got a Z9 and was able to easily connect and transfer using WMP.I bought a reader writer, and I was able to finally get music onto the shine.

{"label": 7, "raw": "Looks great. Charges easily. Love that it's moisture resistant which is perfect for running and doing a lot of walking in various weather as I do. Also my sweat won't ruin it.BIG CON: Very, very twitchy in keeping connected to the phone. Basically if it's not in your back pocket, it's going to cut out a lot if you move your head too much, etc. I prefer keeping my phone in my front shirt pocket, but that doesn't work so well with this headset. Also, you can't very well sit down with your phone in your back pocket either (and then it doesn't connect well either because you are sitting on the phone). So really only works well if you are standing up and it's in your back pocket. All other uses are only so-so.Wish I hadn't bought it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Pros: good pairing and consistent stream. Decent sound although not loud enough.Cons: very uncomfortable fit(my ears hurt just after an hour of having them on), lots of background noise, sound doesn't get loud enough in pulic busy places, extremely annoying when you wear any jacket since you keep feeling it catch.Bottom line: Don't buy it! The participles for a good device is there but they need to improve on the design and make a lot more comfortable before people can start enjoy using it."}

Now my phone is protected from EVERYTHING.I left my screen protector on and that was a mistake- The touch screen wasn't nearly as respondent. I took it apart removed the screen protector and now he screen is totally 100 percent respondent. Only issue is if I want to take my phone out and put in a different case I will loose that protection. But the built in screen protector on this Otterbox works great, keeps my phone protected and that is fine for me right now. Very impressed with my first Otterbox!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "UPDATE:You will drop your phone using this case and I never dropped my phone before. It's very slick with no grip on the edges. Thankfully didn't damage the phone, which displays the HTC ONE's superior build quality as it was dropped on hard ceramic tile from 36\" counter height. Like I said before the clear plastic will and DOES scratch really easily.I did like that you could barely tell that my phone had a case on it and literally had compliments on that fact, but the risk of damage is too great for me.Just reinstalled the stock smoked(color can't display the awesome brushed aluminum on back)TPU case for now to protect it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:It does fit snug and snaps into place, but very limited edge coverage so won't protect like it should. Feels like it would snap/slip off the edge if dropped, not protecting the phone like it should. Polished hard plastic not the TPU rubber/plastic style so it will scratch easier on the back."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I like this case. the only thing that made me worry was the thin section by the volume rocker, but it has held up well. I like that it doesn't hurt my ear when i talk on my phone. i like that it doesn't interfere when I text. I love that it doesn't add any bulk to the phone and still protects my phone.

{"label": 7, "raw": "I've used this for a couple of years as a back-up charger for my Kindle or for some of the phones in my family.  I haven't had much luck charging my iPhone with it, but the rest of the phones did OK.  It's perfect for my Kindle though.As some other reviewers pointed out, it sticks straight out of the device that it's charging.  So it isn't very practical to use the device and charge it at the same time.  But if you're stuck in an airport and need to charge something before a flight, it sure beats not having any charge at all.I assume they designed it that way because it's a more efficient use of battery power than a longer cable would have been.  Just a guess...I don't leave home without mine though.  It's in my emergency cable pouch that I always take wherever I go.  I just have to remember to replace the batteries from time to time."}

I bought it because I drive serveral different vehicles during a weeks time and wanted something inexpensive to hold my cell phone. This does what I wanted it to do only with a little more cleaning maintenance. The pad will hold one item comfortably, such as a cell phone. Add an item and it is a crowded pad.

I don't know if the problem is Pre related, the Pre's bluetooth stack has a lot of deficiencies, or if these are just lousy headphones. Either way the combination of the Pre and these headphones is not a good one, Palm Pre owners should avoid these. I have a cheap pair of wired headphones that have an order of magnitude better sound when used with my Pre."}

Although easy to pair with Blue Tooth to the iPhone once I did it and tried it again at the gym I can't get the music to play and of course you probably already know the controls on the Sony Headset don't control the iPod/iphone?  I thought it was really cool at first but after trying to get it to work at the gym for three days running it goes back.  It is also worth mentioning that you can't use regular rechargeable batteries.  It has a built in Sony battery that you have to use its own specific charger for.  Oh goodie, something else to recharge and keep up with.  Not worth the headaches."}

I can heard subtle details in the songs that I didn't know existed; just like studio monitor headphones.  In fact, they are so clear, I can easily tell the difference between standard mp3 compression sound quality and audio CDs.  I've been using these headphones for days and hours at a time; and, it just doesnt run out of battery power.  It also does a great job of cutting out noise that you dont want to hear in the same room."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Although the plastic looks and feels like very cheap plastic and as if were to fall it'd come apart easily (mine has yet to fall), this is a nice idea of having a AC (home) and DC (on the road) charger for your Kindle or such.Keep in mind though you NEED a tip that's appropriate for your device.  Be it the A00 tip for your Kindle or whatever.  Having this alone will not do anything for you.It comes with a nice black bag to keep both chargers and the wire spool inside of along with the tip."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The headset was purchased to pair with the new Storm, it was terrible, muffled on the called side and sounded like a tunnel on the caller side.  Tried several different phones, landline, other cell out of area codes and even international, same result.  So if your pairing it with the Blackberry Storm don't bother.I returned it and replaced it with the BlueAnt Z9i and what a amazing difference, clear as a bell at both ends of the call, great noise cancelling and seems to pair with no problems, also can pair with 5 devices at once and can switch to the called phone.Hope this helps someone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I wasn't getting very good audio quality, and could not manage to perform the long duration hold of the answer button to get my Samsung SCH-A870 to enter speech recognition mode.Another web-site I found explained how to enable/disable the vibrate feature of the headset, and also perform a reset.Try the search string:Jabra BT5020 Vibrate Enable/Disable Reset the DeviceNote: neither procedure is explained in the manual for the headset which came with the unit (or the downloadable manual from the Jabra website for that matter. That is inexcusable in my opinion. The manual on the web should be made up to date by a manufacturer at the very least).Once the headset was reset, not only was the sound quality better, I could finally use the long duration tap of the answer button feature to initiate voice calling on the cell phone through the headset.I actually like the headset now. No issues with voice or digit dialing.The only drawback I find is the earbud doesn't stay on the earpiece."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I received it promptly.  I was little uncertain at first when I opened the shipping package I saw what it was packaged in, a zip lock bag. I also was hesitant to buy because other reviews stated that it wasn't durable.  But I figured for the price I'll give it a try. I wouldn't lose much if it didn't work out for me and if it did then I got at an awesome price! I've had it for three months now and it works great. It isn't as flimsy as people said it is, I don't see how people could break those prongs.  Sturdy and reliable! I would highly recommend it!!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I ordered these because I was tired of bundling up all the different USB cables I use at my desk. Everything has its own USB cable, micro, mini, etc. We just purchased an IPOD and I thought I would try these. They seem to work well. They appear well made and not real flimsy. I have our IPOD in an Otterbox case, and the flap opening catches on one edge of the connector. I simply used my Dremel tool to grind the corner off the catching edge of the connector, and it fits fine now,. If you have your IPOD uncased, it should work just fine. This connector that goes into the IPOD does have some release catches on it. You need to squeeze a tiny button on each side to release the connection. I mention this because none of my other IPOD cables have any kind of latching system."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I just got it in the mail and I saw the reviews and figured &#34;I'll just reinforce the stitches with a needle and thread when it arrives.&#34; but an examination of it revealed that it's pretty durable. The stitching looks just fine and honestlyI don't see how it's going to come undone after a couple days. On a side note, there are two belt holster options. vertically and horizontally. The verticle holster is under the clip (which felt pretty durable) and then under that is the horizontal one.Maybe I'll end up being wrong, but I have heavy duty needles so I'll just use that to reinforce the stitching if need be. Or I'll be lazy and glue it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this case despite some negative reviews due to needing stuff ASAP as Sprint was shipping me my new S4 and i dread not having everything i need right away..I am using this case for a Samsung S4 with a Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 5200mAh Extended Battery + Black Back Cover (Compatible With ALL Samsung Galaxy S 4 Models) [18 Month Warranty] **NOW WITH NFC / Google Wallet** and the Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 Extended Battery HoneyComb Matte TPU Case / Cover  for the enlarged battery and Door. This case performed great for 2 weeks, then the GLUE just stopped holding the seams together for all stress points on the case. I bought mine from  DeCi Accessories. I cannot recommend this case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Someone, somewhere has a dark sense of humor.  After ordering a CA-100 cable and waiting for the Brown Truck of Happiness to arrive, I discovered that inside the Amazon box was a sealed package festooned with Nokia logo and \"CA-100\" model designation.  The back of the package says \"Nokia Original Accessories\" too.  Inside the sealed box is a Nokia branded CA-101D cable.  What this means is that instead of the CA-100 cable that has a USB connector on one end, and a Nokia 2mm connector on the other, I ended up with a cable that has a micro-USB connector on one end.  So... No joy.  For a $6 cable I'm not going to burn gasoline and time returning it. I can always use this cable with my other devices. However, I cannot recommend this vendor at all."}

It charges even when it is in sleep mode.It is tiny and extremely convenient.The price is high, but for the convenience and function it provides it is worth it. I was not able to find any cheaper similar products offered by third parties. This is the real thing from Nokia.I now no longer need to carry any bulky, ugly, power bricks with me to keep charged up. All I need is this little gem. Very nice Nokia !"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've tried several of these cell phone signal boosters, and I have to say, not one of them is worth a dime.  Do they boost your cell signal?  Maybe...a little....sort of... not really.  Yes, the bars on my Sprint phone do jump a tad when I turn this on, but it's barely noticeable and certainly not worth the exorbitant price.  This one just feels like tech snake-oil.  No, moving to different locations made no difference.  Nothing did.  This thing is just a placebo.  Don't bother."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had 5 bluetooth headsets so far. Jabra was the first one I got, and now I'm back for Jabra. I had problem with it for a while; it kept dropping signals. I tried to update the firmware and now it's all good. I like the fact that customers can do their own maintenance.I'm very comfortable with the wearing, and I have no idea why some people complained--they might have special ear shape or size...I'm using it mostly as a stereo headset and the sound quality is quite acceptable. The only concern is its battery is not long as my other sets, it lasts about 5 hours when listen to music."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I ordered 3 of them, 2 of them came without an issue, but the 1 that had problem, it got very very difficult to get it replaced, the company I ordered from told me to go to Jabra directly, at Jabra website, after entering all the info as per requested, they simply send me an email to how to resolve it and after trying that and notify them again via email (no phone #), and I've asked for an exchange and again, they replied to ask me to do the same process again, it's never ending. Bad customer service."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "All I really care about in a right-now-immediate way is calls.  Texts, and even weather emergencies can wait ten or fifteen minutes for me to check my phone again.  I have tiny wrists, and hate wearing stuff on my wrists anyway.  This I have on a lanyard when it's not in my ear, and it does the job perfectly (OK, I have a FitBit, too).  Vibrating with caller ID is all I *need.* I'm happy to wait out these first few (really) dry runs of smartwatches until Sony, Pebble, Samsung, Qualcomm, Apple (in 2018) and/or Martian finally get it right."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The only reason I gave four stars rather than five is because I've only used it for a couple of weeks and therefore am unable to comment on durability.  However, the material on the tip seems very durable and I've noticed no wear after about two weeks of probably 45 minutes per day use.  I do a lot of news reading on my iPad.  It works very well with my iPad and I periodically use it with my phone (Droid Max).  If I lose this one or wear it out, I will buy another.Suggestions:  Make the tip retractable or provide a tip cover to help keep dirt of it when not in use.  If possible, provide a model with a smaller diameter tip."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm really enjoying my new Kill A Watt monitor because for the first time I can see exactly where and how I'm utilizing power in my house and make a direct correlation back to my monthly bill. The monitor is very easy to setup as well as to move from outlet to outlet in the house. The only thing that's a little bit of a pain is that for some reason it's very difficult to unplug a plug from it. These really should be given out for free from all power companies because it's such an invaluable tool. Now I know exactly what I need to do in order to bring down my power bill. Love it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got this, in part, because my father in law said that his meter said the CFL lights weren't actually pulling the wattage they claimed. I searched online and read it had to do with the way the meter read the load, and the guy recommended this one. So I got it. My CFLs pull what they say they pull, as does my AC unit. So I'm happy with it. I have it happily racking up the costs of my big AC unit right now.It's pretty easy to operate; at least, I just fumbled around until I found the measures I was interested in.  I'm going to have to read how to adjust the cost/kWhr, but other than that, it's good."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really like these power meters, but some of them are not very accurate. I have tried 3 P4460s and several of the cheaper models and found that one of the P4460s read 86 watts when it should have been 80. That's off by 7.5% and is way out of spec according to the manual (which says it is suppose to have .5% to 2% accuracy). I am returning that unit (the replacement I bought reads 83 watts which is better). Some of the other units were off too, but not by as much. Otherwise this is a nice unit but could include an optional short power cable which makes it much easier to handle and use. I like the fact that this unit does not lose readings when power is lost."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This one is not accurate. I have compared it against several high quality meters at work, and the 4460 is always off, but often by a different direction or a different amount.I miss the display in amps the older model had. It was very useful for determining circuit loads in cases where an amp clamp was not convenient.It also hogs both outlets of a standard duplex receptacle, so the other one is covered and unusable. (Yes, a pigtail would help)I e mailed the company twice about the inaccuracy and inconsistency, and did not receive a reply.It became more and more inaccurate and finally died."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Really, the only way this thing would be better is if I could somehow unplug it and use it elsewhere without unplugging the original appliance.  Too bad that's not really possible.As the title suggests, it's loads of fun to play around with, more features than most users would probably take advantage of, and you learn a LOT about what really consumes power in the household (turns out my computer system costs more to run than the refrigerator).  You just gotta buy it and try it for yourself, worth the money by far!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Really nice device to keep track with your power consumption.  Easily allows one to see all information at the push of a button to see how much a device is costing you per hour, day, week, month and year.  Highly recommend.  Found out the Keurig coffee maker pulls more watts at a given time than the cloths iron does.  Very interesting to see what items are energy hogs and which aren't.  Plus it is a nice way to make sure that the energy saving items are really energy saving.  A CFL rated at 9 watts actually only pulled 9.1 watts which is within specs tolerance.  If you are a gadget minded person, you will love this device.  Hardest part of using this device was finding out what your energy cost is in your own area as this must be kept under lock and key if you don't have a utlity bill laying around to show you."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "UPDATE: The display has failed completely on this product. While the buttons 'beep', the readout is blank. What a POS.  Now back to my initial review.I placed a 5000 BTU ceramic heater on this device to see actual usage. The device showed around 11 amps constant pull, but I left it plugged in overnight while the heater ran.  Several hours later when I checked the Kill A Watt again, it was warm, and its receptacle had deformed around the plug, making it impossible to remove.This device is supposed to have a NEMA-rated outlet capable of 15 A draw. This is what customers use a Kill-A-Watt for, to monitor real time use. Clearly this one could not handle prolonged use, and I wonder if I was sold a gray-market product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This perform as advertised.  You plug it in, push a few buttons and it'll tell you how much juice the device(s) are sucking up.  Whether it's a single item or a surge suppressor, it'll tell you all the consumption details you need.  Plug in the cost per kWh and you've got the total cost per the elapsed time.  Calculations are there if needed as well to calculate day, month costs.As other reviews had mentioned the small text is hard to read without proper lighting and angle.  You can get used to the pattern so there would be no need to look at the small text once you get used to it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This device works great and is simple to use. I've had it for a week, and have tested almost every appliance and electronic device in the house - and there were LOTS of surprises. My only reservation is that the display is only visible when the device is plugged in so, in any location where you can't see the display, you typically need to plug it in again in elsewhere to view the result. The low-energy display it uses could easily be kept visible for a minute or two with a button battery, which would last for years in this application. I'm saving my last star for that feature!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm a road warrior who logs a LOT of time traveling.  I've abused this thing in every airport from EWR to LAX and it has performed as advertised to date.  No clip failures, magnetic latch is reliable, it hasn't loosened up significantly and appears to offer pretty good protection for my beloved Crackberry.  The RIM 'holster' function works fine so obviously the phone is sensing the magnet correctly and going into holster profile exactly as it should.  It's your basic black, boring holster that you'll see on 10,000 traveling businessmen in any airport in America (me included).  If that fits your needs, can't go wrong with it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When I purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset I was expecting good things.And though the headset is a little more cumbersome to put on than I'd prefer, and it's a little too \"clunky\" (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars), the sound quality - both receiving and transmitting is terrific!  Even with a lot of noise going on (like when I'm on my motorcycle), the sound is incredibly sharp.Now, I see that they have a new version out, and if they'd like to send me one, I'd be more than happy to see what changes Aliph has made, but I'm very pleased with the one I have."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The over-the-ear piece is a not a good fit for my ears. Moreover, they are extremely fragile and prone to breaking. Within 5 minutes of getting the phone out of the box, I broke the ear piece just trying to get the headset over my ear. I put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece. The plastic piece covering the control buttons seemed very cheap also, and I think it would be a matter of time before that broke as well. I generally take good care of my headsets and electronic equipment, so if the headset seemed fragile to me, it probably will for most. Also, as a woman with a small head, the headset just felt clumsy and big. On the upside, the acoustics seemed decent, but then I only used the headset once and decided to return it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The sound quality is really very good, far better than the Jawbone 2. I did have the ear insert plastic break, requiring glueing. The thing that I despise about this headset is the earloops and how easily they break. You can bend them maybe a dozen times before they fatigue. Aliph has been pretty good about sending out free loops, but I am on my third pair of free ones. I just broke a new one after a week, and I was super careful to not bend it! I am going to ditch this and try the Blueant, as I am sick of handling this bluetooth headset with kid gloves."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have found the Aliph Jawbone noise shield headset to be a pretty good unit.  It fits me pretty well, doesn't fall out, has good audio for hearing, and I have consistently gotten good audio reports from the people I talk to.A few nits.  The charger hookup unit is just plain wierd, and is counterintuitive to hook up.  Why do engineers feel compelled to make thousands of different charging standards for similar devices?  Also, while talking, you have to be careful if you adjust the unit on your ear--it is easy to accidentally hang up on someone.Overall, this is the first hands-free device that I have actually been able to tolerate and use.  I am satisfied, although the unit is a bit pricey."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought the original Jawbone headset in 2007.  It is still the best bluetooth headset for audio quality, on both ends.It is quite a bit bigger and heavier than the other two Jawbone headsets I own, the ICON and the ERA, which everyone complains that they can't hear me (although I hear them fine).  I bought the newer Jawbone because I like to listen to podcasts when not on a call and both supported A2DP and the ERA proported \"hd audio quality\".I also discovered that the earpieces from the ICON and ERA also fit the older Jawbone perfectly and I don't have to use that silly ear clip (which is uncomfortable after a while).  Much better.I think I will go back to this headset for a while - the voice quality is great, the noise cancelling is also great, I can hear perfectly and its built like a tank.  I may even buy another as a spare."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I went to best buy to replace the one that broke and they wanted I think like $20 or more for just a single USB version...I decided to check amazon on my phone first and found this dual one way cheaper here. My old one lasted a few years and I'm sure this one will too. I think my old one died because i had it loose in a bag and i think one of the parts may have been hit by something too. It works great though if you're looking for one!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I must have read more than 30% of the reviews on Amazon about the product. Nonetheless I decided to ignore the iphone 4 users that complained about not working and thus relaying on the product description. Alas, that was an awful choice. After connecting it and displaying the charging symbol about 2 minutes later it warned me the device does not support charging. I tried 3 more times and every time it kept dropping so I decided to leave it as such, even worse the battery seemed to have turned hot. It does charge other usb devices but it failed to deliver the purpose of its purchase: charge my iPhone 4."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This one does the job, and rapidly charges your devices.  I bought two of these for the same vehicle - one for the front seat riders and another for the backseat drivers.Why, you might ask?  Well, my wife and I often need to charge at the same time, and you can do this with the dual USB input functionality.  That takes care of the front seat.  The one for the back seat is for the kids - if you've ever had kids arguing over the one adapter plug for the back seat (if you have one available), go ahead and get this one and let them both charge at the same time.  Trust me, it will be money well spent and make your drives a little more enjoyable!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had the Scosche USB Charger for 6 months and I absolutely love it! It has worked for all the devices I plug into it thus far and it has been very reliable. I use it to charge my Garmin GPS, phone, Kindle, Pocket PC, and a other electronic gadgets.The build quality of the charger is excellent. It has a nice, slightly rubbery feel to it. It is beautifully designed and will make an attractive addition to your car. The green LED light indicates it's powered up, and unlike a lot of devices with LED's, it isn't distractingly bright.If you need a Dual USB Car Charger, the Scosche is a good bet."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Product looks solidly built. The plastic feels velvety smooth. The N85 doesn't charge on this but that's a Nokia issue, not USB device issue. The ipod touch 2nd Gen charges, tho. So it works.I thought it was going to be too high for my VW jetta since it sticks straight up but there's enough space there to stick whatever you want to charge.Product works! Mygearstore shipped it quickly. Not as fast as the Prime 2 day but it was fast enough.UPDATED Jan2012: After 2 years, the product just stopped working. Green light would flicker in/out. Threw it out."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "You are left eared. The 90 degree turn to fit the ear bud turns the wrogn way so it pops off too easily. The sound form this device is decent, but not worth the price for all the hassel of putting this on my ear and taking it off again. Also the earbud kept falling off when not in use. Poor design. I purchased this because it had so many good reviews, which is why I'm writting this one.Great sound if you can keep it on your ear and keep it from falling apart on you. So for me it was a total waste of my money."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Beware that there are two different products shown in the Amazon product pictures as of 8/19/2013. I purchased and review only the round one with corner and bottom openings. From my experience, China-origin venders of this kind of products often ship very different items from what are shown in Amazon product pages.Prior to this, I had tried 3 similar holsters which died in a few weeks to months. But his product has been lasting very long with trusted reliability.Now after 3-1/2 years, though my iPhone has been upgraded from 3GS to 4S, I am still happy with the holster and I went abroad with them several times with confidence. But aging is an inevitable process and the holster now looks very worn. I plan to buy an exact replacement if I can find a trustful vender."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a very well constructed leather carrying case for the iPhone.  You can attach this to your belt and have the headset plugged in at the same time.  The case is tight, well designed and protects the iPhone while in the case.  The case is very tight at first, because it is leather, but will stretch slightly.  You cannot fit anything other than an iPhone (meaning no extra protective sleeve) in the case.Only complaint I have is that the iPhone has to be placed in a specific direction in order for the headphone jack to be useable.  I wish it was constructed so that the jack could be used no matter which way the iPhone was placed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love the DLO case, it fits my iphone perfectly and is very convienent to use, but as I read in other reviews (which I ignored), the Belt Clip does indeed go bad after about 6 months.  It tears away from the leather backing and then the phone can just drop off your waist. Because of the really good padding on this case you may not even know that it dropped and some lucky person walking behind you will get a free Iphone.I am on my Second DLO case so this is not some unlucky fluke, there is a defect in the way the Belt clip is bonded to the leather case and believe me when it starts to rip away its only a matter of days before the phone and leather case fall away from the clip."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Charges my phone quickly enough.  There's a convenient little clip that's hard to see in the photos, but which keeps the coiled portion together so the cable isn't flopping around all over.  It also gives a bit of peace of mind to know it's a Motorola branded charger that's less likely to overcharge/fry my phone.  One small, minor issue is that the light plug end occasionally pops out of its own volition after a warm/cold weather swing, but the blue light is bright enough so you notice when it goes out."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After reading all of the reviews, most of the other cases seemed a lot sketchier to me (reviews were very mixed).  I figured it was worth the extra few dollars to get a great one that I knew would work well (this was getting great reviews).  I didn't want to have to deal with trying to return a cheap $3 charger to some random company and risk that it would put my Droid on the fritz.  The extra few bucks was great for peace of mind.  It works perfectly and charges pretty fast.  No issues and love it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this charger for over a year, it gets very light use and it stopped working. What happens is the microUSB connector doesn't make good contact and we have to wiggle and finagle the cable to get it to work and even then it only works for a few seconds, until you hit a bump and the cable vibrates and loses its connection. I've had the same issue with mini usb to micro usb adapters from Motorola - bought half a dozen of them and none of them work reliably. I won't buy a motorolla micro usb connector again. The media bridge cables are the best, they feel like they click in when you connect them, very solid. Motorola? Not so much."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After reading the various reviews, I got this car charger for my Samsung Galaxy S phone and it charges wonderfully.  I also tried this on the Samsung Galaxy S II as well and it charges well too.  None of my devices got hot after charging.  The charger is also built well and will last a long time in normal use of connecting and disconnecting.  Having the coiled wire is also nice keeping it from getting tangled.  Pay attention to the current draw on your device.  This charger, if used with an adapter, could charge an iPhone or iPod; however, it will not charge an iPad/iPad2.You can't beat it for the price!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased the Motorola P513 Vehicle Power Adpater to replace the original Verizon car micro/USB charger that I purchased with my Motorola Droid and Palm Pre.  I have no use for the regular USB slot that is on the top of adapter and pretty much thought the thing was bulky and an eye sore.  This power micro adapter is slimmer, lightweight and the cord is just the perfect length.  The soft blue glowing \"M\" is pretty neat too.Call me silly, but I was worried that the center blue light would be made out of glass and was concerned if the sun hit it, it might start a fire.  I was happy to find out that it is made of a lightweight beveled plastic instead.Besides using it to charge my cell phones, I can also use it to charge my GPS system and bluetooth headset also requires a micro USB.Great buy under $10 dollars - highly recommended!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this charger for my Droid X, and it works just fine. I've been using this charger regularly for over 6 months with absolutely no problems. The cord is just long enough that I can talk on the phone while in the driver seat with the phone plugged into the adapter. Some people might find it more comfortable to find one with a longer cord, but good luck finding one for such a good price. The light on this charger is very very bright blue, which I find kind of hurts my eyes when I'm driving in the dark, but that's not a big deal to me."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a great charger for almost any phone.  I purchased it for my wife's Samsung S3, but permanently borrowed it for my car after my failed purchase with the Samsung Official OEM Car Charger for your Galaxy S2 Phone.  See my review on the Samsung OEM charger for more details.The charger quickly powers your phone and looks good while doing it.  Motorola gave it a sleek design that lights up blue when the charger is ready.  The cord is long enough for mid size or smaller vehicles to keep it plugged in while using the Navigation app on your phone.  If you have a Samsung Galaxy S2 or S3 and need a back up or replacement car charger, I highly recommend this purchase."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Bought this car charger through amazon it works great and looks stylish, when plugged in the middle lights up with a blue motorola symbol, when off it is see through.  I wanted a motorola charger since I had just purchased the new motorola droid X2 and verizon sells an off brand for 29.99 so this was great for a few dollars and motorola branded.  Was skeptical cause of price, but since amazon selling I felt more confident with purchase, glad I did!  Saved 25 dollars from verizon cost and it looks good lit up at night, reccomend highly!  By the way this is compatible with droid x1 or x2 and probally others but the x's for sure."}

It works better than all of the others I have used.  It is a must for business travelers!! For the price, buy three!Update 10/12I ended up pinching the USB input so I had to buy a new one.  I bought two more.  The sign of a good product is whether you would buy it again.  In this case, absolutely!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have bought a few cheaper ones in the past, and they never last very long.  Cheaper ones have wiring that doesn't hold very well (shorts out very easily), or the tips that  plug into your phone or bluethooth headset,  wear out because of the thiner metal tips (they bend and wont hold snugly).THIS IS A GENUINE MOTOROLA CHARGER.YOUR PAYING A LITTLE MORE,  BUT YOUR GETTING QUALITY!I bought this as a replacement for another purchased just like it, only because their is a blue \"M\" that lights up when plugged in attracted a thief and my car was left unlocked.  If you car outlet gives you power even if the car is turned off, unplug yours and lock your doors.THIS IS A GREAT CAR CHARGER FOR ANYTHING THAT HAS A MICRO USB PLUG."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this item to replace that generic Car charger that verizon sells to you as part of a bundle. Their bulky model is supposedly good for ALL micro usb phones yet it doesn't really secure in the slot very well.After receiving this Motorola adapter, not only does it seem to fit more securely for my phone. it even has a more illuminating status indicator to tell you if its charging/working or not. And given that my phone is a droid Motorola razr, you can literally feel how secure it is when charging vs the flimsy plastic junk verizon sells you.This item is well worth it for the price and purpose."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The only reason I rated it with 4 and not 5 stars is because I ordered one and had to get it replaced because it wasn't working within a couple weeks. However, the most recent one, I've had for months and it's still going strong.  Charges much faster than the other chargers I've ordered over the years.  That circle shines a bright blue light, which is kind of neat, but a little distracting in the car at night.  But over all, quite good."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I saw reviews for this product saying it wasn't Motorola etc. but mine definitely was. Yes it came in bulk packaging but it had all the paperwork and warranty information. I guess those users must have ordered from a different vendor. It is engraved along the front with \"Motorola\" and has the M on the round part.As for functionality, I've noticed that this charges my HTC Incredible 2 very fast in my car and the blue light matches the accents in my Mazda6! Love this little guy and it's a great price!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Motorola P513 Car ChargerThe P513 is a micro-USB car charger that works on the Droid, Droid2, and DroidX. I can't figure out a way to change the inline fuse (if there is one), but it is cheap enough to be used as a disposable car charger. The blue LED-lit Motorola logo is a nice touch, as well as the wire tether that is included.Pros: Gets the job done at a great price, looks greatCons: Doesn't appear to be an easy way to change the fuse (if any) - but it is not a big dealOverall: 5/5 stars"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I needed a 5 Volt DC power supply that could be powered from a 12 Volt battery or other 12 V DC power source. This fit the bill nicely and inexpensively. Clipped the connector off and used my own connector and off to the races it went. My DVM measured 4.99 V loaded at 600 mA and 5.01 Volts unloaded so I am pleased as punch. Plus the temperature rise is only a few degrees indicating good efficiency. Interesting packaging with the Motorola logo lit with a blue led. Might mention the two leads inside the insulated wire (one red, other black) are stranded wire of about 20 guage so I can see how flexing the cable at the connector when attached to a device in an auto might cause an intermittent break. A little duct tape or heat shrink tubing at the connector might not look pretty but should keep the wire from stressing."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have a Samsung galaxy 2 Skyrocket and was looking for a rapid charger since the one I had quit working. I knew this was the same micro-USB power Adapter as my Samsung, but everytime I plug this in my phone it seems to open up the accuweather app and plus I have my digital clock on my lock screen set to display on top and it puts it on the bottom of my lock screen. In order to put it back on top I have to turn off the phone and thats what this charger doesn't do. It automatically reboots it instead of turning it off completely. I know that's not a bad thing but I like it to turn off completely. The only cool thing is the blue Motorola emblem lights up in the middle to indicate it's on. Gonna try to find my old charger and buy that when I find it. I'm assuming that the electronics in this charger is geared toward Motorola only."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this charger not for a Motorola but for a Dell Venue Pro (just another micro usb device) and it works perfectly, charges when in use, etc...The charger lights up blue when plugged in which I kinda like, if that sort of thing bugs you then don't get this charger, although the price is great and it does what it claims to. Definitely recommend.In addition to the Dell Venue Pro I can confirm that this charges the Lumia 900, Lumia 520, Lumia 928, and my current Lumia 1020. I'm still using this charger several years later. It works very well!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Bought the charger for my Atrix 2 phone.  Tried my other chargers and they didn't put out enough power to actually charge the phone.  They would maintain my phone battery.  This charger will charge my battery from about 20% while I'm using it (moderate use) in about 3 hours.  The charger is well-built.  The cable is not thick, but it isn't cheaply constructed.  I suspect that it will give me about a year or a little more of heavy use.  The charger is neatly styled.  If you have a tight area to put a charger in, this may not work.  The rounded end is a little large.  Overall, though, it shouldn't give much problems.  Great charger."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this item a little over a year ago.  The price point is great for a branded vehicle charger.  The styling is interesting and futuristic.  It did seem to charge faster than other auto chargers I have used.  One minor issue is that the blue lighting produced by the charger is somewhat distracting while driving at night. It is bright and can produce glare in the driver's peripheral vision.  This is easily solved by either placing tape over the light source, or just turning it sideways.  The charger worked great hooked up to my Droid X auto mount for over a year, but recently started working only part of the time and needs to be jiggled to get it to work.  You hope when you buy name brand over generic that you're going to get a little better build quality, but at this price I'm just viewing it as a \"lease\" and just purchased a replacement.  I'll try to treat the new one a little more delicately."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I don't understand the bad reviews it's 6$ can't really complain if it last a few months or years. I own 4 now to be in multiple cars and so I can charge more then once device at a time. I am very happy with the price and product. Don't know why this product is so good and beats what you would pay 5 times more for at the store. Just shows how much we as a cosumer get ripped off. Alwasy buyer beware esspecially online. So I at least make sure it is shipped from and sold from Amazon Only so IF there is a problem it's easy to return or exchange."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is no ordinary charger, it supplies LOTS of power. Most chargers really do cheap out on the amperage.  This feeds my power-hungry HTC Thunderbolt beautifully.I tried doing all of the power-hungry stuff you can do, simultaneously: GPS, 4G, and access point on and maxed out by a connected computer. Even after all of this, it still managed to charge after a long time. The phone got plenty hot.The first one I got only worked for a day.  Got a completely free one shipping paid for both ways."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This charger is decent. It works, which is what's important. But some of the features are fairly annoying, which most people can accept, given the low price of the unit, and the convenience of a coiled wire.First off, the unit is large. the plug head is massive, and unsightly. It's basically sticking an advertisement for Motorola into your car, who wants that?Second, the price you pay, you can easily afford a dual-usb socket, which while meaning you'd have to provide your own USB cables, means you can charge two items at once, and it's not in your way as those sockets are relatively tiny.Third, the item emits a blue light, that illuminates the center plastic piece. This is unnecessary to me, and is actually an eyesore, as the blue can be distracting while you drive at night."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought two of these to charge my htc sensation. I have used both stock and aftermarket chargers. I got these because my old one broke at the micro-usb end. This has been really durable, especially at the micro usb end, where these chargers usually tend to fail. The added bonus to this one is that it charges the phone a lot faster than standard chargers. I find that a 1900 mAh battery charges from 0-100% in about an hour and a half. Most of my old/other chargers take a little over two hours. On a daily basis I find that it charges from 50% in about 35-45 mins."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this item from Amazon (not a 3rd party) and was surprised to get a full retail package.The plug design looks very cool, in my humble opinion. However, the Motorola logo makes the plug needlessly long. If you don't have much clearance where you're going to plug this in, you might want to consider a different brand.Also, the Motorola logo glows blue whether it's connected to a phone or not. If your car doesn't automatically cut power to your outlet when you turn off your car, you could attract thieves.Other than those minor issues (luckily, neither of which impact me), this cord is great. The design is fresh, and the entire thing is built with the quality you'd expect from a company like Motorola. I'm using it to charge myNokia N900, and it works flawlessly. On a 45 minute commute, I can go from >25% charge to 100% with Bluetooth enabled."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Okay so it works like any other charger, it still take the same amount of time to charge it has a cool look I was expecting more but hey how much more can you get out of a car charger. It took a some time to get to me plus it was not good on updating me on the tracking. So those are my negatives here are my positives..... I did get the product within the time adviced, it will charge up my phone and it has a cool blue look. Thats all I can give ya. Will still continue business with this company but will make sure to investigate comments before buying."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Well designed.  High power (1.0 Amp) so it can recharge your phone more quickly. Fits my car's cigarette lighter plug snugly and stays in.  The bright blue light is a bit much, but I'm getting used to it.  Cord could be longer.  Fits any phone that needs a micro-USB charger cable.  High quality construction.  Buy this -- you won't regret it.Warning: some phones, like the Galaxy S3, won't charge well if the supplied amperage is not at least 1.0 Amps.  Often, the amperage is not specified in the listings -- buyer beware."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a great fast charger by Motorola. It's increasingly trickier to determine if something sold on Amazon or elsewhere is genuine product or not. \"OEM\" isn't sufficient anymore and most of the non brand name stuff is junk. Be sure to buy \"by Motorola\" (or whatever your brand is - but Motorola will work for most) and these are now half a ten spot on Amazon and lots more in the store.My one complaint, and reason for dinging a star, is that the cord is way too short for use in most vehicles. It's fine for a non smart phone sitting in the console or a cup holder - but it's far too short for smart phone use with the phone positioned on or near the dashboard. I've been unable to find a micro-micro usb extension so I may switch to an power adapter with a socket and just use a long regular usb cable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I searched and searched for an affordable car charger for my new Samsung Galaxy S3 and then I stumbled on this one. I read the reviews to see if anyone tried it with an S3 and I saw quite a few positive reviews. I bought it for less than $5 and gave it a try. It worked great and charged my phone pretty quickly, even while using GPS and streaming music. I think that this device puts out about 950 mah, which is adequate for most phones. One of the reasons it works so well is because my phone detects it as an AC charger allowing for a better and faster charge. Plus, this device looks nice and lights up blue when plugged in. I would definitely recommend it. I actually just bought a second one because I like it so much."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am using this vehicle charger in a work provided Astro van. I purchased this after my upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy SII. I originally bought cheap cig lighter to USB adapters, but one of them popped a fuse on the Astro. I threw it away and bought this higher quality device. When it is receiving power from the car the round end where the cable attaches to glows a soft blue color. The cord has a built in simple management system. the two ends of coiled area snap together. It bundles the cord a little and helps to keep it out of the way, not by a lot, but a little, and every little bit helps in a car. The power output is lower than wall charger provided by Samsung, but adequate. After the cheap adapter blew a fuse, I decided not to put something in the work van that could damage the van further and I believe this is a quality product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had a lot of trouble finding a charger that will do anything but hold the battery steady on my AT&T; Captivate (a Samsung Galaxy S phone) while being used for GPS and with the screen on.. and finally, this one does it. It also does not present itself as a real USB device (many chargers show up as a \"connected computer\"), which is great.Only downside for me is the fixed cord (can't substitute cords for other devices), but for the cost of this, it's well worth one per car."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this originally for my Sprint Evo 3D.  It does exactly what it should, and feels like a quality product.  I originally bought an el cheapo cigarette lighter charger online, and it fell apart after 5 months of light use.  This one feels much more sturdy than any I have ever owned.  Also, at night, gives a cool blue effect from the lighted up part.  It's not really bright, so it won't affect your driving/blind you at night.  The cable is very long, so you don't have to worry about it being too short.  Great product.  I recently purchased the Sprint Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly with it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this for my Samsung Epic 4G (the 1st gen Galaxy S, not the new Epic 4G Touch) since the genuine Sprint charger I bought would not charge properly. It feels nice and sturdy and I have it plugged into a socket hidden inside my center console so the light doesn't bother me. It works great charging my Epic 4G. If it goes low enough again I might buy a spare.Update 1-2-2012:After 5 months of nearly daily usage in my car I'm happy to stay it's still running great. I bought a spare which I keep in my trunk for the day this one eventually dies, but since that hasn't happened I'm very happy and will definitely stick with this model for as long as I have micro-usb phones.Update 5-14-2012:Still working great! I haven't had any problems that I can remember."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I needed a new car charger and for $5 and free shipping, why not try it. Very sleek charger. I've seen chargers that cost 3 times as much not looks this nice. I love the blue light that illuminates when it's plugged in. It takes the guesswork out for me, so I KNOW without a doubt my phone is charging. The length of the charger is more than sufficient. It fits all phones with micro SD connections.As I stated in my review title \"Buy it, you won't regret it!\""}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm disappointed as the title said \"rapid\" charger and its definitely not that. I use my Samsung Galaxy S III in the car for navigation (duh). I was hoping keeping it plugged to this charger will, at the very least, MAINTAIN the level of charge that I had when I got into the car, even if not charge it up fully as I drive. No such luck. My charge kept going down. I had to switch the screen off so the charger could charge the phone up  a bit so it wouldn't go completely dead."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I originally bought this for a Motorola phone, and when I upgraded to a Samsung, I decided to continue using it since the connector was the same. It worked perfectly. I've upgraded again, and it continues to work. It is a rapid charger, and I find that it does charge my phone more quickly than a regular charger. It has a sleek style, and I like the \"blue light\" that glows when the charger is powered. I've bought these for my wife and two sons (and none of us have a Motorola phone). But what I love most, is the PRICE (under $6 as of this review)!!! Verizon would charge me quadruple for a charger.[...]"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This charger is one of the fastest I have for my phone. Being a Micro B USB it will work with almost any smart phone. The spiral wound cord works well for the short distance in my car, but still is long enough for the chasm of my old Ford Truck as well. The only drawback that I've come across is that bright blue LED that can light up the whole car at night. It's very distracting while driving and I strongly suggest rotating the charger so the light is away from the driver's eyes."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Bought as a charger for my MIL's new phone. I went with this version since the cable is built-in and there could be no mix-ups with what cable to use and where/how to stick it since my MIL is not very tech-savvy. She loves it and it works very well on her phone. The blue LED is not too bright for night-driving yet bright enough to see in daytime so you know it's plugged in. My recommendation would be to get a USB car charger so you can use whatever cable you want and since you have two separate pieces, if one fails, you only have to replace that part, not the whole thing. This however, follows the K.I.S.S. principle and works very well. I would highly recommend."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've almost lost count as to how many of these I've purchased already -- I normally keep two in each car to not only charge, my HTC Sensation, but my work Blackberry as well. I've purchased more to make sure I can plug them into rental cars (as I'm prone to forget things here and there) and keep my devices charged.It's a simple adapter, with a glowing blue end - and does everything it has to!Make sure it's purchased from Amazon - too many other reviewers also complain about getting a knock-off product!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Car chargers: one thing I really hate buying. I go into the cell phone store and they want a small fortune for one. If you purchase online you absolutely have no idea what you are getting. This charger is a diamond in the rough. It works great and charges my Droid 2 very quickly. It works so great I bought one for my wife. The blue light is a bit bright at night but nothing to take a star off. The light is low drawn power and it does not get hot at all so I just leave it plugged in all the time. Oh yeah, it got here lightning quick too."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am using this device on my Samsung Fascinate:I liked my first one so much, I ordered two more. One for each car, and one to carry with me (I'm a professional driver, and use lots of different vehicles).Fortunately, the micro-USB interface is becoming quite common, so this also charges my wifes phone, and my bluetooth headset.As a bonus, it clearly lights up to let you know when it is getting power.  This is very handy, since not all vehicles give power when the vehicle is turned off."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have used so many car chargers for micro usb devices.  Many cheap made in china, chargers takes forever to charge the phone.  Some even do not fit well in socket, and some I had to position the charger to charge the phone.  In some charger cord came off from base charger and or micro usb end.After I invested money in this, it seems like solution of all problems.1. Durable cord, which I believe that will be fine during cold winter.2. Durable connections to base charger and micro usb end.3. Cool blue lamp which indicates charger is well connected in power socket.4. No problem with connecting and charging any micro usb phone.I liked it so much that I ordered second one to replace it in my second car!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I don't know much about amps, etc.  This item seems to work well on my Motorola Razr Maxx (because of the battery in the Maxx I am not that dependent on a car charger anymore. Yaay!!!)  But I wish the cord was longer.  I find that the pull of the cord (because it is short) makes it harder to talk while the phone is connected to the cord.  It is also too short when trying to use the vehicle phone dock.  I would rather deal with a bit of extra cord (say a 6ft. length) than have to tussle with a short cord."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Overall this charger works great, the MicroUSB fits well, the cord is a perfect length, and it's a high current charger so my Nexus One charges fast (and doesn't discharge while running the GPS).  I've purchased two of these now, one for me (Nexus One) and one for my wife (HTC Aria).It lost 1 star because the plug part is _really long_ and the silly blue light.  It's actually quite bright and distracting at night, I have to turn the thing sideways at just the right angle.  I could cover it if I needed to, but turning it works."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Thank goodness for whatever committee decided to standardize on the micro-usb connector for power on so many portable devices.  This power port adapter (power port formerly known as Prince,oops, I mean cigarette lighter) will charge both my phones and both my tablets.  I get a warm fuzzy feeling in knowing it is a Motorola device as I have had positive experiences with Motorola equipment.  To top it off, it has a very cool blue light when it is charging.  So a free light show is included.  Nice charger at a very reasonable price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my second charger like this (lost my first one... then found it the day this new replacement charger came in... figures).  Both have worked well with a Moto Droid X and Moto Droid Razr Maxx.  It charges just fine, at about the same rate as the OEM stock charger, so I assume it is around a 1A charger (probably just below 1A).  I don't care for the length of this thing; however, it's worked better than other chargers I've had."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This USB charger really does work quicker than the one it replaced.  I'd bought a generic charger from Amazon some time ago and at some point it got crushed and broke apart.  The Motorola is just a bit bigger than most chargers, but the glowy blue circle is easy to grip and doesn't get in the way of my gearshift, which is actually a pretty important thing to know when you drive a stick.I've noticed it charges my Samsung Galaxy SIII fairly quickly--with it below 20% I might but close to the top in an hour or so.  The cord is long and the coiled nature even provides more stretch if you need it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Wasn't sure what to expect with this, but it works flawlessly and it is very easy to use, as well as very portable.  Probably my only complaints are that you do have to read the manual very carefully to understand the various colors and blinks of the lights, but once you know your way around it - the device just works.  Callers cannot tell you are on a bluetooth and you can hear the callers very clearly.  It has exceeded my expectations.  Plan to get another one for our second car now."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I found this headset very comfortable, with excellent audio quality, the few times it successfully connected to my Nokia phones.After working with BlueAnt tech support and trying it on two different phones, they admitted that they have a known issue with Symbian OS phones (most Nokia and some other smartphones) where the headset can be \"paired\" with the phone, but it does not connect reliably for incoming or outgoing calls. Phrases used by the tech included:\"[We] haven't got around the compatibility issues with Symbian phones.\"\"[this is a] known issue.\"and apparently there is a significant amount of discussion on the BlueAnt support boards (which he could not find during our call).NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SYMBIAN OWNERS as much as I would like to!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is easily the best bluetooth headset I've used. I use a cell phone in my home office all day, and I need a headset that sounds very natural and as close to a land line sound as possible. This one delivers that, with very clear sound on both ends.  It's also the lightest one I've used, and it's very easy to wear it all day without discomfort. It also doesn't drop connections with the phone (a blackberry).  I've used a jawbone (sounds like it's a shortwave radio transmission), nokia bh-900 (clear but very uncomfortable for all day use), and a half dozen others in the last few years, and the others don't come close.  I also like that it comes with additional ear loops, but I doubt I'll need them since the earloop seems sturdier that the little wire loops most headsets come with, and I won't be carrying it in my pocket due to discomfort.Buy this one, you'll love it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Prompt delivery, and it is exactly as described.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven't washed it yet- so I don't know how it will hold up... Other than that my little girl LOVES her tutus (we got one in light pink also), especially spinning and running in them :)  She's on the little side, so my concern was that it would be too big, but the fit is perfect!

I really don't think you can ask for more from a product.My only regret is that I didn't know about this product sooner! I certainly would have bought it for each one of my children throughout their schooling! What a GREAT product for homeschooling as well!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I actually have used the Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 1 & 2 and found it great in terms of learning the language. At first, the Rosetta Stone method seems harder because you associate pictures with words and phrases but their whole premise is that is how you first learned a language by seeing something and then associating the word with that object or action. It is way better than pure memorization! I have gone through several lessons and I am picking it up rather quickly as I have a background in Spanish. Overall a great way to learn a new language!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been using this for a few weeks. Previously, my Italian was limited to stuff I'd see on \"The Godfather\" and a few foods. I'm a bit better now, and eager to see what the further levels of Rosetta Stone look like. Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning like living there, but it's pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros:- Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept, rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons:- Doesn't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 doesn't contain a whole lot- It's obviously pretty expensive. I guess if you're *really* interested, it's worth it.For it's purpose, it is almost perfect software. You will feel confident with the basics after this."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Good costume.  Very detailed.  I like that the body is a foam so it stands up a little on its own.  You might not be able to tell from the picture, but there are shin-guard type pieces for the legs, and gauntlets on the sleeves.  Nice touch.  It is a little thin overall.  You'll definitely want to put something underneath if you're in a colder climate.  My only disappointment is that the back of the torso is entirely black.  It's ok for us because I bought the inflatable wings, but without the wings, I think it would look weird."}

{"label": 8, "raw": "It might just be me.  Although it seems well made and sized right.  It just seems a bit flimsy to me.  I debate if I really should not give it 5 stars as it does everything it advertises itself.  When I travel out of country, I have this around my neck and under one layer of clothing.  I have my &#34;throw away&#34; wallet in my pocket with expired cards and a few dollars.I like the various pockets and zippered security to keep things in place.  The neck cord is a little long so I had to tie it off so the stash would fall mid chest making it a bit more concealed.4.5 stars - minus 1/2 star for long cord and a flimsy feel.  Again though perhaps being flimsy is a good thing being under clothing making it conceal more."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this item to attach the handle of a backpack to a 22&#34; carryon.  The strap is well constructed, but the minimum length is too long to avoid your backpack from dragging the ground when pulling the carryon. A laptop bag or purse is fine, but not anything as vertically high as a backpack.  I purchased the Travelon bungee cord for this purpose and will try it on my next trip.  I'd shorten the minimum length of this thing and it would be fine.  Otherwise, it will be fine with a checked bag coupled with a smaller carryon or purse/backpack. But for smaller luggage, not so much."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "We got several of these before our overseas (by plane) trip.  They came in very handy for stacking the bags and luggage we had to manhandle through customs, airports, into taxis & B & Bs, etc.  They were very easy to use & sturdy, and I recommend every traveler carry a couple for unexpected needs (to bind more than one thing together for easy carrying).  I used one every day in the rental car to hang my bags on (hung it from the head rest) so items didn't get tossed and lost."}

The only problem we've encountered is that it rides up pretty high on my son's back, above his shoulders, so he keeps pulling it down lower, but it won't stay. It's pretty durable for an inflatable. My son crashes into things, the dog has stepped on it, but it still works."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Purchased at Bagram Afghanistan PX in 2007 and this watch is a must-have for anyone treking into the mountains (of which I did, alot).  Over the years the watch has taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but, I still get a lot of comments about the watch.  The altimeter (incl the memory function) worked very well.  Battery replacement is easy (and has to occur about once a year).  The watch is a typical ABC watch, that looks good and does the job."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I sent this to my granddaughter for Christmas and never heard back or got a thank you or even if my granddaugter received it. I am only guessing that it was all that it was suppose to be. Since I had it sent to myself and I wrapped and sent it to them myself I did get a look at it from outside the box. It looked pretty good quality to me and I would have bought it for my daughter when she was little if they had it then, I would still recommend it as a nice gift as it came in a very sturdy box and everything looked like fun to me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My oldest daughter, who is now 5 years old, got one of these purses a couple of years ago from my mother.  Out of all of the toys that my daughters have, this is the one that they would fight over the most, so for my youngest daughter's 3rd birthday I got her her very own \"First Purse\".  They both love playing with all of the included accessories, and often throw in a few additional items of their own.  The purses and accessories are all very durable, in fact, I had to put my daughters' initials on everything because I really can't tell the difference between the new items, and the items that we've had for a couple of years already.  Out of all of the little purses that I've looked at online and everywhere else, I definitely feel like this is the cutest and best deal out there."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got these for my daughter because I favor black Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star high-tops myself when I wear sneakers, and she likes to clomp around in them, so I thought I'd get her her own pair. Once she found out they come in pink, no other color would do.  Sigh.  But they are SUPER cute, and the lacing up the ankles means they fit tight and won't come off, but lots of room to grow through the toes.  One drawback, the laces are hard for a toddler to manage, and she has extreme difficulty getting them off by herself."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The title says it all. I loved these, but you literally have to wrestle your kid and near mangle his feet, even when a size or two too big- to get them on. THEN you have to lace and tie them! On a kicking toddler! Yeah, right! IMPOSSIBLE to get on for the most part. And don't seem comfortable either. they need to create this same shoe, but but an easy access ZIPPER on the side, down to the toe bed to get the young child's foot inside."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm a major Converse fan, I like to collect them in all different colors, why not pink? I already knew my Converse size from the other Chuck Taylor colors I already owned, so sizing wasn't an issue at all, even though most of my other Converse are low-cut Oxfords. The high-tops can take a little more work to get onto your feet, but it's worth it I think for the high-top style. And the pink is a nice subdued shade, not a gaudy hot pink or anything like that. Definitely recommended for both women and men who are secure enough in themselves to go out and about wearing pink Converse. They look great."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I knew I had the best shoes when my then 10 year old cousin went nuts for my pink hi-tops a few years ago!And he was even more excited when I gave him the key to my SUV so he could see the new pair of limegreen ones I had just purchased.I think that I wore the pink ones while travelling in California a few years ago.  While we werehaving lunch in Santa Barbara one day, I noticed a store across the street and found some supportsthat allowed me to do even more walking while on that 2 week vacation.  I was in my late fiftiesat the time, and it was fun to see the expressions I got while wearing those shoes!!!  Since Imisplaced the old pink pair, I am now replacing them.  My favorite shoe of all time!!!Mary"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I didn't get my All-Stars on Amazon, but I wanted to write a review. I actually bought mine used on eBay about two years ago in June 2012. Like other reviews note, they do run large. I normally wear a size 10.5-11, but got a size 10 and they fit comfortably. I bought gray hi-tops with red trim. I initially got them for dead-lifting back when I trained with weights. Since then, I've been using them for casual wear and they've held up very well. I currently live in northern New Jersey and these shoes are nice for non-winter conditions. The shoe has eyelet vents, so when there's a lot of rain, snow or slush on the sidewalks, you may want to go with something else."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I remember buying these exact same Chucks for 39.99 not too long ago what happened since then? Other than that, still a great shoe, comfortable and classic. Wear them with anything anywhere. I did buy my normal size and half a size down but I ended up keeping my normal size. The smaller size did fit but I was more comfy in my normal size, I don't feel that they run abnormally large. I am now ready to order in pink and green next. I love the high tops, I never liked how the low tops looked on me, the high tops offer more option and style in my opinion."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The shirt is fine, good quality, fresh, comfortable, like the picture. It is a little delicate if you touch with it surfaces irregular... some strip can fall out. I bought two sizes more thinking about my son could wear it for more time and it will not fit too tight like picture... maybe that is uncomfortable for a kid BUT although that size fit relax but fine the sleeve is too long, I had to cut it so I think that the better way is to buy it in the correct size or maybe one size more and cut the sleeve. Wherever, my son loves to wear this tee.(Sorry for my english)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My 4 yr old son needed black shoes for a play he was in. I didn't want to buy dress shoes as he would not get any additional wear out of them. I opted for these black Converse. They were adorable, they fit him well - he is about a size 11 little kids but I ordered the 12 and they are fine with a bit of growing room.  He calls them his &#34;Chucks&#34; and thinks he's cool when he wears them...well, he is pretty cool - he has worn them several times since the play so overall, it was a good purchase."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these for my eight year old little sister and she's loving them. She says they are very confortable, very bright and vivid color and loves showing them off. Her first pair of chucks! I'm a proud sister! Very good buy, arrived pretty quickly as well. Great stiching and laces (came with two pair-black and white) If you're getting these shoes to work in, I don't recommend. They are made tobe confortable but have very little sole support and the toes are kinda squished so perfect for little feet (like mine and sister's)  I have bought three pairs from this site, very great buy!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a great looking, simple looking sneaker or deck shoe in a variety of colors. I wear an 11 1/2 EW (EEE). These shoes were only offered in D widths, so I bought 12D. It fits my foot length and width, but it's a little tight from the top of my foot to the sole of my foot. I wear a 1/2\" lift in my left shoe, but it won't fit in this shoe. I wear this sneaker without my lift if I'm driving with only short walks outside the car. The soles don't afford much protection if I step on a walnut in my back yard - so I try not to do that. I bought these shoes in green and red. The first time I wore them, a young man passed me and said, \"Great Chucks.\""}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These shoes are true to size, are authentic converse, are comfortable, and arrived on time and in the correct color.  My only complaint about converse is that they are a bit too narrow. However you can find them at pretty much any shoe store so you can always try them on first before you buy them.  I am happy about the price too (they were $10 more expensive at DSW than here on amazon).  They don't offer much in terms of arch support, but overall I can't complain."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is my second pair of chucks so I kind of knew what to expect. I also have a pair of high tops and love them but decided to get a low top for the summer. I got them in carmine rose and they are such a pretty color, so glad I went with them! It is a light and airy shoe for spring and summer and the color isn't too girly or childish, I just love it. They will look cute with anything from shorts to skirts to jeans. Converse is a go to classic. But, if you need arch or ankle support these are not for you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "It was easy to follow the sizing guide and the bra I received fit appropriately (it's supposed to be tight!). I like fastening it in the front instead of the back, but there are quite a few hooks that can be tedious to fix up each time. I was disappointed in the efficacy of the bra for vigorous activity. This was my last stop in my tour of expensive sports bras that the interwebs say are best for ladies with large breasts, and I was hoping that it would blow the competition out of the water. It didn't. It's playing nicely with the other bras in the water. This bra works fine, but I didn't find it to be anything special."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm a very active person with a 34DDD chest.  I am forever on a search for the perfect bra.  For sports, this is it.  I can wear it in my highest impact activities, and everything stays put.  It's not really attractive, and sure doesn't look great with a spaghetti strap work out top, but it does the job.  Getting into it is a little tricky; you start at the bottom hook and work your way up, adjusting your breasts as you go.  It is supposed to feel tight, so you might think you have the wrong size at first.  But after wearing it for a few minutes it feels comfortable.  ZERO bounce or movement.  Incredible!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, I normally wear a 40 band bra, and an F/G cup depending on the brand. In a Lane Bryant Full Coverage bras I wear a 40DDD. I followed the measurements and this bra holds very well, but I have spillage at the sides and the top. The band fit correctly and I honestly feel if I went up a size the band would be too big. For myself I will seek a bra with cups and not numbers. This bra is awesome if you are a 40 DD, (40 DDD the biggest) as the sizing chart states. I give credit to the fact that for the cup sizes provided was correct. I guess my &#34;girls&#34; are just way too big. I will keep it and wear a compression vest on top of it.  My measurements did fit a size 4 though, so for ladies looking for some serious hold, definitely get this."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought a white Enell about 3 years ago and had it fitted in a store. So that was helpful because I was confident in what size I needed to buy. But the size chart provided is helpful and seems to be accurate for me. This is SO supportive and makes my workouts so much better. Also this is the only bra I can run in. I will say the purple one feels slightly cheaper than the white one I bought years ago. The straps are a little papery/less padded. I'm  not sure if that is because it's newer and they have changed them all or just this purple one is different. But either way it's still great and very supportive! Will probably order one more in black just so I have a clean one at all times."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have 40/38 DD size breasts but I love to run. :-( THis bra has been my go to bra when running, doing HIIT and Turbo Fire. I've tried other bras such as the Panache and to double bra other bras but nothing compares. My ONLY gripe is that it's not adjustable and at 64 bucks a bra that sucks especially if you're losing weight because you'll have to spend more money on a smaller bra. Get this bra if you're looking for maximum support. I'm actually going to buy another one because I don't want to have only one."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra does what it claims it will do--it provides firm support even for plus sized women, and the support doesn't go away after washing.  I just wish it weren't so shiny.  It's not terribly attractive, just functional, but the straps will show with most clothing, so you may want a lacy camisole over this.  Unless they can change the shininess without reducing the support, I'll live with it 'as is'.  A great bra in terms of function!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Pros: no bounce, very supportive, holds everything in & even does some minimizing.The big con is their goofy sizing. I ordered according to the measuring system the company uses, which put me right in the middle of the #2 range. It turned out to be too small in the cups, especially. I experienced the same ass everyone else in that the band is waaaaay tight! It gave me head & neck aches wearing it the first few times, though I did not mind the extra back support. I read that this bra is supposed to be extra tight so I just accepted that. But I can't accept boob spillage out the sides & squishing them together in the middle. I love this bra, I love the idea behind what it's supposed to do. I guess I just need to do some re-sizing, maybe up one or two sizes & see how that goes. I really want to love this bra!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this bra not with sports in mind.  This is not a 'pretty, feminine' bra. As a large busted woman, I was tired of being disappointed with ill fitting bras. I needed the back/posture support and ample coverage.  This bra provides both--however the drawbacks are: 1)the straps are not long enough for me and 2) It gives you that 'minimizer bra' look. Nice wide straps and it provides cleavage coverage.  You may want to wear a tank or camisole with lower/open neck tops."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have used a version of this bag for many years and keep coming back to it.  I tried a Baggallini bag recently and decided I didn't like it so well because it actually had too many compartments for me and I'd forget where I put things.  With the Ameribag, I find things more easily.  I also need to carry a water bottle with me and this bag has just the right amount of space for it, whereas I didn't have that with my Baggallini.  I have lengthened the strap to use it cross-body style, which is more comfortable for me to carry.  The extra-small version is just right for me, a short person.  The larger ones are a little too big.  With this size, I can fit a baglet inside, which can be handy at times.  I like that this nylon bag is washable.  It cleans up easily!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased this due to the good reviews it has on Amazon. I plan to use it for long day trips, weekend trips, and vacations. It has plenty of room, separate sections, and extras that will work out great for holding all kinds of stuff! I can't wait to use it! I have smaller bags like this where the strap goes across the body, and I prefer that when traveling or walking around all day long, but I definitely needed a bigger one (but not too big - haha). I feel safer knowing it can't be stolen from me and it is also more comfortable to wear. It is made well and I like that the material will repel water. Great bag!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "However for me it just doesn't hold enough to be really a piece I'd be able to carry long term. Now we all need so many club cards for stores you to those plus a credit card and drivers license you can barely squish your Health and Car insurance cards it it. Unless you don't have much to carry, I'd say skip it. Buxton, consider making this a little bigger to carry more and its a serious winner. Now if the banks would still make this style of checkbook It would be very convenient."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a very nice wallet.  I purchased this one to replace the exact same wallet.  My old wallet was identical to this but was about 15 years old.  (They do wear out after 15 years of constant use.)  Buxton always makes beautiful quality leather goods.  I like that the change purse closes with a metal clasp and not a zipper.  I especially like that there is a divided change purse --- I use one side for pennies and the other side for all other coins.  Also,  I like that there are two paper money slots ---- I use one side for bills and the other  side for checks.  (yes I am very organized.)  I like this wallet very much."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I absolutely love this wallet.  I've had it for about 2-3 weeks and its durable and pretty.  It looks exactly like the picture, its got plenty of space.  The only thing I will mention is that in the cash parts, there is an opening, so you can't put loose pieces of paper or anything in there, because it might fall out.  Otherwise its great, there is enough space for a bunch of cards, cash and change.  The wallet can feel a little bulky when completely full but its great."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been looking for years in stores for a replacement for my 25 year old wallet.  I am a creature of habit--and do not trade in ANYTHING lightly.  But you can imagine the looks I got with the one I was carrying, beyond old--it was tearing apart, looked terrible--but until I found EXACTLY what I wanted--it was staying.  I just got finished transferring all my life from that to the new Buxton wallet.  Mind you, a wallet to me is a brief history of my life-- where I carry Catholic holy cards, my NRA life-membership card, pictures of my late husband and drivers licenses dating back 15 years.  ALL FIT WITH NO PROBLEM.  I am sorry I did not go on line before last week or I would have found this much sooner.  But EVERYTHING, I mean it ALL fit with no problem.  HIGHLY recommend."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just ordered this item for my wife as a gift.  She was very happy with this product.  I don't know anything about it, sinceI don't carry one of these.  All I can advise to the customers is, what she said about this product.  She stated that itwas a well known brand, and she liked the soft leather and the well organized compartments in the billfold.  She reallyliked the quality and the full rich color of the leather.She advised that, a product such as this, is hard to find in the department stores locally.  She was very pleased with thelooks and color, and the percise arrangement and the design.  Must be a good one, she is very happy with it.The picture and decription of this item, is right on the money, on the sellers page............."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These don't give me much support but I did not really expect them to. I wear a 32D and ordered a size C they covered perfectly. I feel like this may work better if you are fuller on top. I'm fuller on bottom and the tabs just pull the skin and makes me look wrinkly. They did give me some support, however they also made a strange cone shape and made me look quite pointy. I would wear these with something that already has some support or is a thicker fabric. However, they will definitely come in handy with certain outfits and would be perfect for a special occasion dress that already has some structure."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I made a Halloween costume, but it soon became apparent that the inside wasn't padded well enough... Ordered these pretty much last-minute, got them the day of the party, and I must say that they certainly did their job! I couldn't even tell I was wearing them, either. After the party, I ended up falling asleep with them on, and even then when I went to take them off the next day, it didn't hurt at all. It pulled just a tiny bit, like pulling off one of those cheap bandaids with really weak adhesive. Also, they hadn't come off at all during the night, and I toss and turn a lot when I sleep, so they seem to last well.I was wearing something with a little bit of padding, so I can't speak for how well they will do underneath something very thin, like whether or not the edges will show."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am so happy with these... they feel great and very sturdy.  The sizing chart was accurate... I am 5'6/200 and I ordered 1x/2x which fit fine.  The control top is very comfortable compared to other brands.  The fabric is very smooth, not too flimsy but not suffocatingly thick either. It also is not snagging like other nylons, nor do I notice any pilling.  They are so comfortable, and I expect to get many more wears out of these.  I am so impressed with these I just bought 2 more pairs."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Purchased this to wear under a formal dress for a wedding.  The control and slimming aspects are outstanding; really made my dress hang well.  Unfortunately, every time I sat down, the bottom would ride up so once I stood again I would need to slip into the ladies' room to pull it back down.  I avoided anything with a seat because it becomes so cumbersome to go to the bathroom and thought this would be a good alternative but it was not.  I would buy a Ragu product again just not this style."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a rago 1359 obg every day. with it on I have a flat tummy again. Wearing a girdle does meanwearing panties under (Vanity Fair Nylon Rivissant) - to help put it on and stockings (Berkshire It Fits)toprevent ride up. Dressing in the morning takes a bit of time but my girdle does stays in place. At first it is tight, then comfortable, and then I forget that I have it on. I do not have that girdled look and I really dolook better with my girdle on."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "For $7 you get 4 of these things - what more can you ask? I bought these as opposed to buying new racerback bras. They are certainly tricky to install - probably best if you ask a friend for help. BUT once in place, they work really well to keep your straps in place, and if you have a top or dress that dips in a little as I do, they are great for helping to hide your straps! The beige color is more of an ivory than a nude, which was my only disappointment. But glad I got them!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This gown is generous in fit, soft, washes up beautifully and comes out of the dryer with no wrinkles and packs easily. I would suggest going down one size if you are between 1x and 2x. The color is exactly the way the photo shows and is a deep hot pink color.  I bought the matching robe as well and the same can be said about it as the nightgown.  I do not find it cool to sleep in, as other reviewers mentioned, but it is certainly comfortable and pretty enough to wear it around the house and especially when visiting friends and you want something to throw on quickly to make those bathroom trips in the middle of the night! The style is rather matronly, and is  suitable for mixed company or when you need something simple to wear while getting coffee in the morning."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Having previously purchased a Shadowline long gown in 2002....I was in desperate need of a new one...with red being my favorite of colors, this was a no brainer.  A red Shadowline...hands down!My previous purchase was from a local upscale dept store and through the years it has seen it's share of some rips and tears; however it is still together, just a lot of wearing, but I will not part with it even though it has now been retired.I'm so glad this item was available...and will be a continued customer of Shadowline (until maybe I have every color) and Amazon...amazing service ~"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Truly terrible.  I purchased two of the three packs and upon opening one package I discovered that they were full of pulls that would lead to runs during/after first use.  Next I tried on another pair only to discover that whilst the length of the stocking was fine the spandex/elastic was so weak that they almost immediately fell down even though they fit.  Also, I found them to be very sheer.  I thought that by purchasing the 'fantasy black' that they would be more like tights in color but that was not the case.  Overall, very unhappy with this product and will be returning for a full refund."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very nice bra, but the material is a bit stiff, which keeps the girls where they're supposed to be, though. It'll give a pointy shape, which is not very flattering with regular t-shirts, but will add some lift with \"flowy\" tops.BE AWARE: even though it says that this item qualifies for free returns, you will have to pay for the shipping costs if you want to return this bra!!! Amazon customer rep told me it's because the product is not sold/fulfilled by Amazon itself, but by a 3rd party. It puzzles me why Amazon mentions free returns on the product page when it doesn't apply  to that specific product. On a product that doesn't cost much, having to pay for return shipping is quite a waste."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I almost always order Bali bras because they are true to size.  I ordered 44DDD and it fits me perfectly and is very comfortable for maybe half a day.  After about 5 hours the underwire started to poke under my arms.  I much prefer not to wear any bra with an underwire because they are notoriously uncomfortable, but apparently there are none in my size.  The covering on the underwire is quite soft and cushiony but still the wires poke through into my under arms.  I am disappointed but maybe I am ordering the wrong size."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This isn't as 'sexy' as some bras, but it looks GREAT under clothes, and is supportive without feeling constrictive. Sometimes when this is sold in outlets, something is 'off' in the material; it's a little scratchy....but from Bali or as this was sold from Amazon, it's l00% right.  Washes well and lasts so much better than some of the fragile bra fabrics.  Maybe not so special for 'date night', but for a great bra to wear all week, it's terrific."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "First got this bra when my daughter was doing a performance with a lot of jumping around.  Her bra wasn't making it, and we looked for one better.  Found this, perfect.  Due to the non elastic straps, and the fine support, this bra holds things in place all day long, better than any other bra I have ever owned.  My daughter and I are both well developed.  Most bras are challenged when it comes to supporting us, except this one.  It is also very comfortable.  You know it's on, but it never hurts.  It also puts your chest in a good position, not spread out but forward.  Looks very flattering.  Truly great support, and pretty."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This has been my favorite bra for Years! Every once in a while I do try a different style but I always go back to this one. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the strap on my right shoulder slides off my shoulder so I do have to wear a rubber thing I found in a bra shop made just for that problem, it kinda bothers my skin, reason I try others. But I've never wornout any of the others before I'm buying another one of these..... they just work better for me. These I wearout & have to buy new ones."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was doing a lot of reading online.  And the bras with the best support are seamed bras.  Most of the new seamless bras are overly padded and flatten me out.I looked at my local stores but it's very hard to find a seamed bra that isn't a minimizer in huge sizes.  Most start in D cups.This is an attractive bra visually and I would normally just order up one size,  but I look like I should be the musical \"Grease.\"  Or in a 1950's TV show.My husband said I was a walking weapon in this thing.  I could use my breasts to poke the eyes out of a potential attacker.It does not look like the photo of it on amazon.  Anyone who put this on, would have to push their breasts into the front of the narrow part of the cup to fill it, and would end up looking pointy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have bought Bali bras before and have not had problems with them.  Had under wire bras quite a few times and didn't have problem with them either.  Have worn 1 twice and I was at work and I had to cut out the under wire is was so uncomfortable.  I will be returning the other 3 that I bought.  If I was smaller they probably would be alright, but being on the heavier side when I sit down there is not enough padding on the bottom of the bra to protect the mid-section."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Being a very busty woman, I'm constantly looking for a bra that will smooth and minimize my proportions. Bali is a trusted name in intimate apparel, so I tried out this bra. I love the way it feels and how it makes me look when I wear tee shirts and sweaters. It runs true to size, so I didn't need to return it for a larger size. I recommend this bra to women who have the same problem as I do with finding a bra that will fit and look good!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra does provide support & lift, but it is not 'seamless'.  This bra is part of the Bali &#34;Classics&#34; collection, so it's been around for a long time.The cup isn't a stretchy type of fabric, so you can see a little of the cup material through my tops.  And, you can see a little of the cup seam (slightly).I just bought Bali Passion For Comfort Minimizer Underwire Bra, and that one is seamless-  that one is a stretchy type of material.  It smooths out over the breast.  So, you won't see the cups through your tops with that one-  although that bra fits a bit more snug."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "first off i'm 4'9, 34 dd, an its hard to find a great bra that actually fit.now because i'm heavy on top, i have the bras that have skinny straps that dig into my shoulder leaving me sore and a mark. this bra is heaven, it fits like the picture.now it doesn't give much lift if that's what you, want but it supports an don't poke you (wire) or cutting into your shoulder.now far as making me size look smaller... yes! and when i wear shirts it don't leave those lines.i will buy more!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "38DDD.  I wasted way too many years buying Lilyette.  Lilyette quality has diminished dramatically over the past year and I was concerned about finding an alternative.  I tried the Bali Satin Tracings Minimizer and was pleasantly surprised.  The Bali is rather comfortable. Washes well.  Life-span is average.  You'll know when to buy new when you feel the fit change.It is also a 10X better minimizer than any other bra I've tried.  In fact, I used to need apparel tape to keep the front of my blouses from gapping.  With the Bali, my clothes fit perfectly without needing that bothersome tape.  Hopefully, they will make this bra forever and leave it just the way it is...don't change the fabric, don't change anything to make it &#34;new and improved&#34;."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I think I will like it better once its washed several times and stretches just a little.  I have had these before and found the same thing.  If they offered half sizes, I would have gotten a half size larger.  I know the next size up does not fit...its too big, BUT this is a nice bra, does a good job of minimizing.  It does go up a little into my arm pits, but I don't think that will bother me after it softens up a bit.  Like the straps and shape of cups.  Well made.  I would love to find a bra that I give 5 starts to but probably will not in my lifetime."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn these gowns for close to 20 years.  I like how they are made without any itchy lace or scratchy seams, how they make rolling around in bed easy, and that the fabric is a better quality than any other nylon nightgown I ever owned.  I also like the &#34;flutter&#34; sleeve especially now that my upper arms are not what they used to be, it is nice to have them covered but not constricted by a traditional sleeve.I knew that the Shadowline brand had been sold in recent years, so I was a little concerned about the quality having changed.  I just bought 2 in the magenta color since it was new (for me anyway) and was delighted to find that the quality remains.  I have always gone for the darker colors since they seem to afford just a little more modesty than the pastels."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "We received these shoes as a gift, and I'm actually ordering a larger size for my daughter now.  I love these shoes!  They're so adorable, and we constantly receive compliments on how cute they are.  My daughter has been \"standing\" since she was about a month old, and she's actually started to wear out the bottoms from pushing herself along when she's in her walker.  Even so, I'm really quite pleased with the construction and materials.  They're very easy to slip on wiggly feet, too.  These have become my go-to gift for expectant moms with a baby girl on the way."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These tights are extremely soft and very flattering. They fit perfectly and looked very sleek and of high quality. The only thing is, I purchased the barely there color and it is a little darker than the picture. In fact, it is more of a tan color and would go perfectly with people who have a tan complexion like I do. You really can't tell I'm wearing tights until you come closer and even then, it is such a nice, sophisticated look. These tights would go great with formal evening wear and dresses."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Hanes Silk Reflections for over 15 years now and I still love the sheer look and silky feel of them on my legs. I have many pairs of Hanes Pantyhose for daily wear in different colors as well as Silk Reflections Thigh Highs and Stockings. I have tried other brands but always come back to Hanes Silk Reflections. I have tried other brands of pantyhose that are as sheer but not as durable, I have found some that are as durable but not as sheer, Hanes has it all for me.  The fit is perfect they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles even after a long day.I am an Amazon Prime member and that has been wonderful the shipping is always fast and on time. Whenever I can find my Hanes hose with Amazon Prime available I purchase them. It is so much easier to buy these online and have them delivered at no cost I am so happy with my Amazon Prime membership."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose.  I have been wearing them for over 15 years, I have tried others but keep coming back to Hanes.  I love the feel and looks of them they fit me perfectly and still look good after a long day.  They feel wonderful on my legs and feel great under my clothes whether I am wearing slacks or a skirt.  They are also very durable for such a sheer pair of pantyhose.As an Amazon Prime member I used the 2 day free shipping and received the package on time and in good shape."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These hold up and are a great value. They are also very pretty and flatter my not-the-best legs. I don't like wearing pantyhose but in a professional job they are still needed. That's my opinion, anyway. I have some great dresses and suits with skirts for work (yes, I am the consummate professional) and these are a necessary accessory. Is 'necessary accessory' an oxymoron?Thanks, Hanes. You make me thinner and more impressive.  How many products can honestly boast that?Marcianne Waters"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I went ahead and purchased it, thinking i'd be getting tanned color. For some reason, i have this way of thinking buff= dark/tan color... Turns out it was not even close. I normally wear barely there, and this one was very creamy. Although this isnt something i would wear on a normal basis, it did go really well with my black skirt w/ white feathery sweater top. I wouldn't dare wearing it with any other though, just not my color; Too bright. It was a nice try though."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Ok ladies, pantyhose, in general, are getting difficult to find anymore.  Many women hate them.  But, for those of us that don't have a problem with them, it seems as though there are expensive tights or leggings to choose from, and no more 'pantyhose'.  Let alone NAVY.  This is the real deal.  I plan on buying more for my 'stash'.  These are the tried and true navy pantyhose and I keep a few pair in my desk for that occasional runner that might happen once every other year.  You get what you pay for, and these are a bargain for the quality.  Love them!  Thanks for carrying, Amazon.  Now, I can save gas money from running all over the place looking for navy hose."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm accustomed to push up bras because of my lack of endowment, so this was definitely something different. Straps are nice and thick. Back band is wide. Front portion lays flat underneath bra instead of tilting up. Cups themselves are two layers of lace that support nicely but do not form the breast as a padded bra might. Will not hide *ahem* signs of 'cold weather'. Middle portion does tend to press into the chest. My boyfriend will love it when he gets back from the holidays."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a 38C Bra size, and this bra fits the bill!!! Love it!  I just ordered another one.  I would highly recommend this bra.  It is very sexy, and comfortable.Update:After wearing this bra for a day, it's NOT comfortable.  I would not recommend it all, and I have returned the other one that was ordered, and the one I kept goes in the \"Not form fitting, and comfortable\" draw.  I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead, so far it is very comfortable, and fits nicely to the breasts.  I will be ordering another pair!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra is beautifully made and quite supportive. I'm large-busted (anywhere between a 32DDD and H, depending on brand/maker) and chose to try a 34DDD for this bra since cups run small on most brands that aren't specifically for large chests, and this item doesn't come larger than DDD. It turns out to be a little large in the cup, which almost never happens to me! But the support seems good and the bra is both delicate and sexy while still providing coverage. I'll be returning for a smaller size."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I L-O-V-E (LOVE) these briefs.  I sometimes have a hard time finding them in department stores so was very glad to be able to buy them on the Internet.  They are comfortable.  They allow a little forgiveness when you gain a bit here and there without stretching out if you lose a bit (I wish more often).  They also wash and wear very easily and simply.  I can even throw them in the dryer.  What's not to love?  :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Bali Skimp Scamp Briefs are THE MOST COMFORTABLE UNDERWEAR I have ever worn in my 64 YRS. of life!! They are very Soft and Silky with a back seam instead of side seams. These briefs NEVER, EVER Ride up or get stuck (you know where), they ALWAYS Stay in Place, my clothes glide over them very easily and there's No visible Panty line either!! I would rather go without than wear any other under garment!! Try 'em, You'll LOVE 'em too!! You'll Never be Sorry with this purchase."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are the best.  When you get them out of the bag, you might think you ordered panties that were 2 or 3 sizes too small, but that's just the way they look until you try them on.  They fit great.  They hold in your stomach quite a bit and the leg opening doesn't ride up in the back.  Stays put.  These also come in a lace waist band that rests lower (on your hip).  I have that style too and it is  nice but I like these better."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My 11-year old daughter is 5' 2&#34; and weighs 103 lbs.  She's straight as a board and doesn't have much of a butt.  However, these size 4 fit her very well.  I was concerned, since I ordered online and couldn't hold them up to put my eyes on them before I bought them.  She really likes the prints and when she tried them on she said they felt more like a bathing suit bottom.  That's good, since bathing suits need to fit your body kind of tight.  They're Jockey, so they're made of great quality!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have shopped at many bra shops in the US and Europe. If you are a 38G and short-waisted this bra is the one for you. I have paid over a hundred dollars in Houston for this bra, so to find it between forty and fifty dollars on Amazon is great.  The bras are from England and the quality is excellent. The material the bra is made from never breaks down, it is the wire poking thru that signals that the bra is dead. When this happens I get out my sewing machine, fix the area and use it for another year or so. Even at one hundred dollars Fantasie bras are worth the price!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm really impressed with these shimmers pantyhose tights . They're warm and durable like tights but have a really sexy semi sheer, shimmery look to them like luxury pantyhose. .Great to wear with a mini and heels to really show off  your legs and they'll still keep you  warm.They  fit fantastic and are very comfortable to wear for long days.They also give your legs support,  feels like you wearing leggs sheer energy pantyhose . I've  tried a lot of  tights and these are one of the best and the price is reasonable.Love them!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love these shoes for work but they are a bit pricey.  I bought a pair in black and navy - bye-bye $135 plus tax.I wish they came in a brown but the nearest they have is taupe or bronze and they are rarely available in my size... 9W.  The \"bronze\" has been unavailable in my size almost a year.They are fairly true to size but still take a bit of wear before they are comfortable.They tend to pinch on the toes and I've had to treat several painful blisters as a result.I like the arch support and the small heel.The only drawback apart from the price is that the lining comes loose very quickly and then slides around inside the shoe which is uncomfortable and annoying."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this for my 8 month lean baby boy. I did have to take it in a bit (It is sized for 12 to 18 ), but it was easy to do. He loved it and had it on all night over his PJs. It is made with mobile babies in mind, not one hole. The top fit well on his head over top of a beanie (I put the beanie on first for a while till he was used to it, then added the top) he didn't even notice it (until the top would flip down, but to really a problem, flips back and is pretty sturdy) ."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I absolutely idolize Kylie Jenner's sense of style, so I had to purchase a pair of Timberlands. They were delivered super fast and I got a really good deal on them since I bought them in children's size. I am a size 7 (sometimes a 6.5) in women's and I got these shoes in a children's size 5.5. They fit great! They're kind of heavy, so it takes a while to get used to walking in them but they look amazing. These shoes are very durable and great quality, so you can tell that they'll last for a long time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I know how long they lasted because my Amazon purchase history shows when I bought the last pair, on 11/27/10.  I know they lasted more than 2,000 miles because  I always wore these shoes when I walked my dog and that was twice a day, one mile each time.  I wore them on other occasions as well and figured I would go with the most conservative values which to me are still pretty impressive.After all this the soles started to wear, I figured it was time to get a replacement &#34;dog walking shoe&#34; and ordered the same shoe again.  The size, 12W, was dead on and the shoes are as comfortable as before.  They are still light, and have an effective tread without looking clunky."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These shoes are probably the most comfortable I own.  I'd been thinking about getting a pair for years because of all the positive reviews so I finally pulled the trigger.  Good call, because they are super comfy and easy to slip on and off.  On the downside though they are black seude shoes.  I must not have looked closely enough because I thought they were just black leather.  I suppose I just don't see myself as the type of guy that wears seude shoes.  I power through it though because these things are so comfortable.  They'll work great for casual wear in the winter/fall, but come summer spring I don't see myself sporting these shoes with shorts.  They really only work with jeans.Fit was as expected, unlike Keens that usually need a 1/2 size bigger."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Merrell's WERE great, perhaps when they were made in Canada. These are identical in stated sizing to a wonderful pair of Merrell Jungle Moc's I wore comfortably in and out of the house for years, but my heel slipped a lot in these, there was way too much toe room, and they seemed 1/2 to 1 size too large. I wear a 9.5 US Merrell but these felt like 10-10.5's. I had to return them for properly fitting and comfortable Teva's. I do not recommend these, I would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Merrell Men's Jungle Moc Slip-On,Gunsmoke,13 W is a not so good fit for my son.  I wish Merrell made more WIDE and extra-wide shoes.  These were a struggle to get on over socks.  After a couple of weeks he admitted to me that he could not wear them but was unable to find the box and receipt for a few days but when he did he brought them over to me.  We printed off a return label and immediately took them to UPS for a return.  The easy Amazon refund only took a few days."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I must like these shoes, this is my fourth pair, and they're all still in use. I discovered Merrell's hiking shoes maybe 10-12 years ago, and always found them to be well made, durable and comfortable. The jungle mocs continue the tradition, and add the convenience of being a slip-on. This makes them my go-to shoes for a run out to the mailbox, for any activity that involves walking, yard work (the oldest pair), etc. They are also good looking enough for business casual wear at the office, going well with khakis or jeans on casual Friday."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've tired imitation Merrell mocs in the past.  They fit just fine and lasted forever, but the comfort wasn't even close.While an imitation isn't uncomfortable it doesn't have the arch support or contoured sole that the Jungle Mocs have.I normally wear a D-E width shoe and these.  I did buy the D as I though the EE would be too wide.  The D does run narrow. If you are on the wider side I'd suggest going to the EE.  Other than the slightly narrow fit, great shoe."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These shoes shipped fast and fit perfect. I needed work shoes to wear during 12 hour shifts in an ER. These are awesome for that. They support my feet and they do not rub my toes raw. They are also easy to put on and pull off. They are not the best looking shoes though. My wife makes fun of them all the time on me but I don't care. They feel amazing. Perfect shoes for work but I would not wear them out in town or on date night."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just got these this morning and haven't taken them off yet. I may sleep in them! They fit true to size, easy on/easy off and very comfortable. Even better, I live at a ski resort and the soles on these shoes are incredible on snow and ice. I had the Merrell Shivers, which were warmer, but very slippery on ice.Merrell makes a lot of different soles. The ones I got look like they have octopus suckers on the sides and little square nubs in the center. Very bizarre looking but very sticky. These soles come on the standard Jungle Mocs.Edited 11/30/12: I just got my second pair. What a difference. As great as these shoes are they don't last forever, so treat yourself to a new pair when the soles wear down. They feel awesome again!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Wow, these are just SO comfortable to wear.  I've worn so many different kinds of shoes over the years.  A $400 pair of dress shoes may have some comfort when on your feet for ten hours, but these are just like walking on air.  I've put on a few pounds and my feet are not as forgiving as in my youth, but these are some of the most comfortable footwear I've ever worn!  In a weeks time I've had three strangers stop me and ask about them, and another two have said, they own 'em and yes, it isn't just me, these Merrell Jungle Mocs are truly comfortable.  I've never recommended shoes before, but I'd recommend considering these for real comfort."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So the arches are really hard and pronounced, and they are not the same on each foot, another reviewer said he had a defective left shoe, well I think I got the matching right side.  I've been trying to stick it out for a week, even directly putting my heel and all my weight on the arch to try and \"break it in\" but it's not budging and I'm going to end up limping if I try to keep it up. The first day I wore them, it took me a couple of days for my arch to recover, I thought I had just hit it wrong or something.The styling and design of the shoe is great, so it is disappointing that it is not comfortable, I really wanted to like these shoes, I guess I'll see if I can send them back because they are defective."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "KSwiss Classic Luxury sneakers are one of the most comfortable sneakers there are, especially for being as simple, less bulky as they are.On the inside, they are very cushiony, especially the sole. My husband wanted a simple, comfortable, black sneaker to wear when he does security work now and then &#34;on the side.&#34; He needed something that would be good for standing/walking long 12 hr nights and did not want something too expensive as he only does this a few times a year, for certain events. These sneakers fit the bill perfectly and were our first choice since they fit every aspect we were looking for.They are simple, but look great with anything. I have been wearing them myself for decades, but this was my husband's first pair. He was very happy with them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "After laughing the whole way home from the mall after seeing what looked like clown shoes for $150 or more I was glad to find these on Amazon.  Ok, I admit I'm in my mid forties but I'm sorry the multicolored goofball shoes I saw didn't impress me much, they just look ridiculous.  These however have a simple clean look and are some of the best fitting athletic shoes I've ever owned.  I like a snug fit and these fit like a glove.  You might not be the gym peacock but your workout won't suffer."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "If I could give it zero stars I would.  Not only was it HUGE.  The body would fit my three year old....but the legs would fit my 9 year old.  Plus we ordered a SUPERMAN costume.  This showed up without a cape and was a &#34;Super Hero&#34; suit.  The belt was made from felt and the the details were painted on with bad paint that peeled off, and were not even straight lines.  Bad form Amazon for letting this one slip by."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "If you are looking for the Reeboks that were made in the 80's and 90's, this is not it.  The first pair I ordered in the size I have worn for decades was too short and way too tight thru the toe area.  Ordered a half a size larger and they were still tight thru the toe area and the heel area is too large, but the length was right.  I had to use inserts in the heels and put them in a stretcher to make the toe area comfortable.  Will not be ordering these shoes anymore."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I use to love these in the '80's but hi-tops became obsolete.  Glad I could find some because in the hot summer I hate wearing my ankle braces as they make my feet sweat too much and constrict my blood flow making my feet and ankles swell.  Anyway, although I haven't worn these out of the house yet, I'm sure they will work well for me provided I still use my cane.  I will admit in reading the other reviews, they do run narrow which was fine with me and the length was perfect.  Nicely made too."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I gave this to my fiance as a birthday present, i love Cahartt and i have other products from them. We live in Boston, so the jacket is very warm and fits its purpose, the only problem is that is very, very big, i think i got him the medium one and it fits like a large one, it's very bulky too, but as i said, if you are looking for something warm, go for this one but maybe a size less.Nice color and it's cool that it has inside pockets, at least that's what my fiance says :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Warm and Sturdy.  I have only had this coat for a couple of weeks, but it appears to be living up to all the good reviews.  Very warm and very well made (in Mexico).  I fully expect to use this jacket all the time because it is warm and fashionable enough and should be able to handle anything I can put it through.  I am looking forward to breaking this coat in over the next few months but am very confident I made the right choice.  For sizing:  I am almost 5'8&#34; and the medium came about 2 inches below my waiste aind is plenty big to wear clothing underneath.  However, again, the coat is so warm, I am wearing T-shirts in sub 40 degree weather with the coat on - even on windy days."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The wife went for an Mt Everest Base Camp trek, from Lukla to EBC and back to Lukla- 11 days. The problem was the weight allowed was only 8KG (about 17 lbs) for the porters carry, therefore even extra pairs of socks were a bad item to haul. She carried 4 pairs of these socks and they did an amazing job of keeping her feet clear of all the sweat and ensured that she suffered no blisters doing about 8-9 hours of walking at that altitude.She wears shoes- Timberlands 7.5M and Reeboks US 9.5- probably due to the differences in widths. These socks fit upto US 9.5 for men perfect, and if you are 10+ then these may not be for you.All in all, she recommends this for any prolonged wear and for closed shoes, unlike track/sports shoes, where ventilation could be in issue. Absolute recommended buy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Women's size 11 shoe size here (Men's 9 1/2) and I ordered the large.  Could not be happier!  I love the padding, and the comfort in terms of temperature and moisture.  I have a foot injury, and I need support and cushioning for my toes and the ball of my foot- these socks are perfect.  They are very thick- so make sure your shoes can accommodate them- but aside from that caveat, these should not give you any trouble, and at least for my shoe size, the fit was perfection."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, I am 6'2 210 lbs and when I bought my last shirt like this a decade ago I purchased it at a local army / navy surplus store.  It has lasted great and is getting thread bare :). I read the reviews before buying this one, I normally get XL in every shirt I buy but went with the Large after reading the reviews.  I also will buy Longs when available but also opted out of that decision.  This shirt fits perfect in the shoulders, the sleeves are plently long and so is the length.  If it helps or matters mine was made in Honduras, I would have given this product a 5 star rating but is does not seem to be made with the same weighted material as my original that was made in the USA so long ago.  Hope this helps ya all......"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These socks are absolutely amazing, and I cannot believe how much better my feet feel after long walks or workouts with wearing them.  They make all of the difference in the world.I learned about the Cool Max sox from reading Leslie Sansone's book, and decided I should use all of the research that the US Army put into finding which socks held up well for soldiers in the field.  These are for walking workouts, and have excellent cushioning just where you need it, plus they wick away moisture.Your feet will love you for getting these!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "There are the heaviest and best work and all around pocket t shirts . I like I can get tall sizes that never show a plumbers crack and tuck in well keeping in warmth  . The long sleeves ones are great to layer in winter . The material is almost as heavy as tent canvas but soft as it is cotton . They are generous to size but do order your regular one because air pockets are good insulators as well as aid in wicking moisture and drying  . They shrink a tad . Carhartt's are absolutely the best but you do have to pay up for them . They are worth it . If a thinner material will do I will try other quality brands like Key's or St Johns Bay if their on sale but truth be told the Carhartt's are best . They stain less and the same goes for other wear and tear. I have found it is better to not use bleach when washing these .Good luck"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Have purchased Carhartt for years and recently have noticed the fit and the crew ribbing at neck have not been uniform. Different locations where made all have different issues. Purchase in question, color spinach is stamped &#34;original fit&#34;. No others have this and this fits the most different. Am comparing this to what I considered original fit when the product had tags. These are sized uniformly and the ribbed neck have held their shape after many washings. I've purchased the 6.75 oz. only when stated, when no mention of weight assume their not. Am not a happy camper."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this jacket to replace the exact same 4 year old jacket that is starting to show signs of wear on the sleeves and cuffs. This jacket is not exactly the same as the original. They cheapened it up quite a bit. The lining is not of the same quality. The quilting is thinner and the elastic in the cuffs is not as elastic. This jacket is compared to a 4 year old jacket that has been worn three seasons for four years.This jacket appears to be typical of much you buy today. It's made with cheaper material, by an off shore manufacturer for pennies on the dollar.If I had bought this in a 'brick and mortar' store and had other jackets to compare it to, I may have passed it up for a higher quality piece.Still an okay jacket, but not the same."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got the Sandstone Active Jacket in &#34;mushroom&#34; color, which is exactly as shown in the picture -- it's a tan color but more brown than beige.  This jacket - above all - was a great value. I'm not sure if I got an off season discount or what, but when I saw it I jumped on it.  The jacket itself is great. I have owned three of these in my lifetime and they're pretty hard to destroy.  Mine just got to looking kind of ratty after many years, and need replacement.  The quilted flannel lining is warm enough for sub-freezing temps with layers underneath.  This is the original work wear jacket. I have seen a bunch of knock offs, but Carhartt is still the king. It's not about the label, it's about the quality."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was originally looking at the Sandstone Sierra Jacket but after trying on the Sandstone Active Jacket at a local store, I realized that the active jacket is more suited to getting in and out of a car... less \"jacket\" in the arms and waist. Both are very comfortable and warm. The hood serves as a scarf and as a hat when I get caught in the rain, sleet or snow. I am 6'1\" and approx 200lbs, the large fits me well, comfortable with some room for layering when needed. Frontier brown is a good shade - not brassy but not flat. I really like this jacket."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The quality of this item is very good, the reason I rated it 3 stars is because it is very hard to size these correctly.  I've just ordered my third pair, hopefully these will be right.  I went to the carhartt website and ordered as they suggested, the first pair was too large, the second too small, I hope the third will be just right.  I would suggest you try these on in a store first to get the right size.  Amazon's return policy and quick shipping has been top notch, the only thing is I have to return and re-order rather than return for an exchange.Edit:  Well the third pair did not fit me like I would have liked, but it will have to do.  Try these on before you buy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Good quality product. The waist is true to size. Fits well. The legs however are quite loose. Loosest relaxed fit I have ever seen. Depends on what you are looking for. Great to work in if you squat or bend your legs. Lots of room. They feel really great. Almost like you are not wearing any pants. Very comfortable. I feel they look a bit funny for like wearing out. I have refered to them as my clown pants.LOL.. However I do like them. I would rather have them too loose opposed to being too tight. If you are looking for a work pant I recomend them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These jeans are the best on the market for the money. Compared to wrangler and levi the fit and finish is miles above. I usually rip out belt loops in the first week of owning jeans and these carhartts are holding up better than any before. I love carhartt shirts and now their jeans. Wont buy anything else.Side note, these jeans fit very tight. If you are looking for a wrangler type regular fit, get the relaxed fit carhartt jeans.**EDIT** these jeans fit really oddly. super tight in the hips and butt but loose in the thigh and knees. They taper down really tightly onto boots. Also, I can see through the fabric in the seat of the jeans. They have no ripped but i am keeping an eye on them. Belt loops are holding strong."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Well I've been wearing these jeans for a few years now. Levi's and others seem to have lost their quality and fit goal and so a number of years ago I stopped buying levis. The particular jeans fit well...I'm not the smallest guy around at 6 foot tall and 285lbs. These jeans fit well and are comfortable to me, they fit like jeans should on a man...(certainly not skin tight). Good product and well made (the product line pics don't really do it justice). I will continue to buy these jeans as long as Carhartt keeps the product on course. Well made quality product that fits right."}

These are a pair of work jeans I keep in my car for site visits at power plants and they are cartoonish how blue the darkstone are. The only thing worse than wearing a pair of dress slacks around a power plant are looking like a mark with these jeans.May just need a few washes to dim these out a little bit. Again, quality looks on point though. I will update if there is a fade to the jeans."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I actually take an E width in a shoe but decided to try these in the 9.5D.  They are a little tight across the top of foot which was expected as even EE boots are tight there.  I will use a form stretcher at the spot and they will feel fine.  I found these on a closeout at a fantastic price via Wholesale Deals so could not pass them up.  GREAT SHOE at a GREAT PRICE!  On top of this they were received within three days.  &#34;THANKS AGAIN AMAZON&#34; for a great deal."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My criteria was that I expect to be doing some traveling soon so wanted a shoe that had many sneaker-like features, but worked in more social and business situations, especially in countries that frown upon sneakers in non-athletic situations.I've been wearing them for about a week. Shoes pretty good overall. Good feel and fit, works well with my stride.Couple of minor dings:1. Color of actual shoe closer to a brown, rather than the greyish khaki of the picture2. Collar of the shoe has a shallower angle compared to my other shoes, so it rubs against my ankle bone. It's a padded collar so it's not too bad, but could get irritating over a long day.3. Stock insoles were pretty thin.Modifications:A. Replaced insoles with Dr. Scholl gel inserts, although may have to find a thicker insole or double up to avoid ding #2 aboveB. Sprayed the shoes with a Camp Dry equivalent.If I remember, I'll post an after-action report when I return from my trip."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Have used Rockport's for years.  They use to be top of the line for comfort, yet look dressy enough to wear in the office.  Comfort, quality, and value......but something changed.  I bought a brown and black pair of this model.  They are wearing faster than the older models and are NOT as comfortable.  When you notice that you are wearing shoes that is usually a clue that something is not right.  The old Rockports you could put on and walk in all day and never think about your shoes or your feet.  Not so with this stiffer version.  Sadly looks like when these wear out will have to try to find a more comfortable shoe."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a replacement pair for one that I have been wearing for years! These shoes are comfortable right out of the box - no break-in period. The nubuck finish is a bit suede like, but not as fussy, I like the look and the color. I notice an inconsistency in the inner-sole of one of the shoes. The foot feels a very slight but annoying change in sole thickness just in back of the toes. When I ordered an additional pair in black, that same inconsistency was even more evident in one of the shoes - so I returned that pair. Be aware of the error - you may need to return them as well if the feel is apparent to you.Based on my last pair, I expect these will last beyond my interest period. At some point you just want a new pair of shoes and these things refuse to die! I use them for everyday use for all but dressy occasions."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Haven't had them too long but the quality seems great for the price.  The grip on the bottom is really good, but its a hard material so they seem like they wont wear out fast or hurt your feet when you step on a sharp rock.  The stitching, velcro and straps all seem very good. Most comfortable sandals Ive had yet, the rubber you step on is squishy. They also have a lip in the front which helps protect your toes and keep them planted in the sandal. I ordered a 13 and they seem very true to size. hope they last!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was going whitewater rafting for my bachelor party and wanted sandals I could wear in the river. I also wanted them to last. I turned to Columbia. The sandals are decently comfortable, but take some breaking in. Expect a sore foot the first 3-5 wears.The sizing was accurate and I did not feel that they were too big or too small.The only problem I had (well two...) was that they did not stay on very well in the river. The front strap kept being pulled over my toes so my foot was resting on top of the front strap. This was rather inconvenient while trying to prevent yourself from drowning in raging rapids. The second is my wife hates them and thinks they make me look like a computer nerd - if only I wore socks with them.The water had no ill-effects on the material."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was able to fit my 120lb ex in this bag (Just so we are clear it was when we were dating, I didn't kill her or anything). I use it to store a memroy foam mattress for transport to my college apt. This is a big and durable bag I have loaded lots into before and dragged to my car (Again...it was not a body). The zipper and bag seem pretty stout and have held up for me so far. A strap would be a nice addition if I had anything to gripe about it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I coach my son's little league team and decided to get my own equipment and bag. I bought this hoping it would have room for 5 batting helmets, catchers gear, balls and bats but for the price I wasn't expecting it to last more than the season.What I received is a monster of a bag. The quality is quite good and I see this bag lasting a very long time. It's actually far bigger than I need it to be. I would estimate that it holds around 8 to 10 loads of laundry. It's just enormous.I would definitely recommend it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this Texsport bag to store myGuide Gear Double Wigwam Tent.  This bag is huge and is big enough for my 8-man tent with room to spare.  The only thing I don't like is it doesn't come with a strap.  There are plastic loops where we can attach a strap, but we must supply our own straps.  It does come with carry handles and a zipper down the middle, which I like more than the ones that open on the end.This is one tough bag.  Great for camping.  I'm glad I found it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear these in the yard and when working in the cold and snow and I love them. They really do help keep me warm in the wind.I wear a 38 x 30 or 32 depending on the cut and style of jean. In work boots these are the perfect length for a person who normally wears a 30 length. The same is true of the width, I am usually a perfect 38 and these fit really well.When I need a pair of jeans for wearing after work I will be looking at Wrangler. Very impressed."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Problem is I put it on the ground and it moves when you put your shoe through it.  It has screws to mount it but I can not use that application. I need it for anyone who passes through my gate at the backyard and it seems a bit narrow for the shoes we use. It is truly a \"Boot Brush\" with the high sides which would be fine for a work boot or sneaker but I would do better with a straight across brush since we use flip flops and sandles much of the time and the sides are too high for those type of shoes."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is an excellent shoe scraper.  However, to work effectively, it needs a base, which is not easy to attach.  Apparently you can remove the bottom brushes and use the drill holes, which I did not figure out.  I screwed a piece of scrap board into the bottom brushes from below (through the drill holes), which works fine, but requires fairly exact measurement.  The board extends @ 9 inches to each side of the brush.  I stand on the board with my off foot so that it is firmly anchored when I brush each shoe.The fit is very tight, which is necessary for the brush to remove debris thoroughly.  I suspect that reviewers who complain of the tight fit for large shoes have not attached an anchoring board.The product would be improved by the inclusion of instructions for attaching an anchor board.Because I have a small back porch, I have to keep the apparatus a few feet away on a paved surface."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold, they are still quite affordable.The stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything.  They stand out on the lobe and I was worried they'd be really small, but they are not.  In spite of the decent size of the stones, these are really lightweight and you can't tell you're wearing them, at all.I think these would make an excellent gift and I'm considering buying an additional pair, just for that purpose!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like wearing these earrings - they are simple and classic in design and since I require gold posts (get knots in my ears with other types of metal posts), the challenge is being able to afford multiple pairs and colors.  For $33, I am quite satisfied with these even though the stones are not as bright and darkly colored as the picture indicates (hence four stars for this truth in advertising issue).  The posts are sturdy and backs fit securely.  Peridote stones are translucent and free of visible inclusions.  The color goes nicely with my spring wardrobe.  Appropriate for all ages.  I'd highly recommend them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These duragold 14K yellow gold half-round hoop earrings are the best on Amazon! These are made high quality in nature and are made to last. These have a great clasp that won't ever let you down. These will not fall off-they are made well. These look classy, stylish and are a must-have for all. They do look bigger in the picture than they really are though but I didn't want them too big. They are by no means small just not as shown-so please keep that in mind when purchasing them. I absolutely love these earrings and will have them forever. A definite recommend to others on this one!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband purchased these for me to match a white gold necklace.  I wear them 95% of the time.  I sleep in them.  They are very small, but that's what I like about them.  They're dainty.  The latch is still working well, even though I shower in them and sleep in them.  I change them rarely, as they match the necklace which is sentimental to me.  I had meant to get some more white gold earrings and just haven't.  These have stood the test of time... even though I didn't mean to challenge them that way."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "When I received these, they looked like good quality and the latch looked secure. I wore them to work (I have a desk job) and lost one the first day. Fortunately for me, the cleaning lady helped me look for it and managed to find it on the floor in the office. Now I'm scared to wear them again. I have another pair of sterling silver hoops that have this same type of latch. I've worn them for years, and they've never fallen out of my ears. I can't help but be disappointment with a pair of earrings when one falls out of my ear on the first day, especially when I did not do anything to cause it to fall out."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wanted a 1\" gold hoop and found it with these earrings. The gold is shiny and beautiful. The clasp is solid and stays together. It is hard to find this size hoop. These are replacing a very large pair my husband bought me for Christmas. (They were so huge that I looked like DUMBO!)These are perfect to wear for dress-up or casual. I wear lot of turtlenecks so was looking for a pair that would not get caught all the time in them. This is the perfect size.I also have very short hair - so these earrings complement my hair style without overpowering me.They are also very comfortable - so much so that I sometimes forget I have earrings on.Buy with confidence. These earrings will delight anyone looking for a decent quality and reasonably sized gold hoop."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm a typical guy that is basically clueless about jewelry, but I can certainly appreciate the ease of buying something on Amazon as opposed to going to a jewelry store and dealing with salespeople trying to push expensive products. My favorite move is when they take out their calculator and magically apply some unknown discount to what may or may not be a sticker price. My wife absolutely loved these earings - I don't know exactly why - but if your loved one is asking for gold hoop earrings these are the real deal."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The reviews on these earrings were so mixed that I wasn't sure I was going to be happy when I received them. I'm pleased to say I was not unpleasantly surprised.They are flimsy, they're very light, they don't seem overly trustworthy, but they're very pretty AND under $150. If you're looking for solid heavy gold hoops that will last a lifetime, you need to visit your jeweler and be prepared to invest. If you want a delicate pair of chic hoops that will fill a hole in your jewelry box for less than the cost of a nice dinner out, these are for you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I used to buy Duragold years ago, and was surprised and pleased to see it available here. I bought both the 4 mm and the 5 mm yellow gold ball studs. Please note the posts are shorter than normal, which I love because I can sleep in them without them poking the back of my head. The butterfly clasp is small, so I replaced them with a locking type of clasp from a different pair of earrings. I have worn the 4 mm ones in my second hole continuously for well over a month with no problem. One thing great about Duragold is that they're hypoallergenic, which is important for those who can have reactions to different alloys in gold. I really like this brand."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm & 6mm sizes.  I was happy with all, but not with this 6mm size.  These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner.  While they look good, the posts are too short and very slippery, also the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily.  I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost).  Otherwise, they would have been fine.  I returned them and would not buy this pair again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased these on a gold box whim.  They are larger than I expected, and the rose color is not really discernible.  They look yellow gold to me.Yes, I'll probably keep them and no, I wouldn't recommend them to others.  They are much too large for second ear piercings.  They aren't the style I usually wear.  So far, the backs have securely held them in each ear and the posts are reasonable diameter.  They appear to be adequately made, but don't really look like high quality earrings."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are such a great size, are nice and shiny, and have a good weight to them.  I'm super happy with this purchase.  However, the backs are completely useless.  They just slide on and off, up and down the post--there is no catch whatsoever.  So I'm disappointed that I'm going to have to spend the time, money and effort to pick up replacement backs, but I expected this based on some of the other reviews.  So don't hesitate to buy these since they are great quality and a good value, but do plan to replace the backs before you wear them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Received these as a gift and while as a general rule I enjoy wearing ball earrings I will NOT be wearing these. They are going to be returned ASAP. They really are awful, feel much more like plastic than gold and are sure to fall apart or dent on the first wearing.There are other pairs of 14k gold ball earrings in my jewelry box and even the ones that are much smaller weigh more than these.If your intention is simply to just own something made of 14k gold then I suppose these would serve that purpose but if you want a pretty and serviceable pair of earrings, pass these by."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This was a pity gift to myself because it was my anniversary, and I've just had nose surgery.  Like other reviewers, I was also surprised at the quality of these earrings.  I try to look for bargains on Amazon to make my shopping dollars go as far as possible, and these seemed to be a good deal at $24.99 when regular price was $75.  Just since March 16, though, both retail and selling prices have changed on Amazon to be $34.99 and $70.  It's very true that the posts are a little thicker than normal, but not onerously so; the result is that the hoop is not going to slide around on your ear, and the post clicks securely into the catch on the other side.  The earrings are larger than I expected for the price, which is good, but they are not too big.  Nickel size is about right, and they feel as if they have some weight to them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Here is a great gift idea and a great value as well. For the price of just under $200, these are 14k yellow and white gold pieces that are stunning in style with a mirror-like finish that is a real eye-catcher. They are of a fair size  and look heavier than they are. They are well made and nicely presented in a gift box and a velvet pouch. They are stylish enough to be featured in a 5th Avenue window where they would probably sell for 2 - 3 times the price of admission here. Running out of time for your sweethearts holiday gift? Just pay a few more bucks for next day delivery and you are all set! I just don't see how you can go wrong with this fine set of earrings."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I really wanted an ALL Rose Gold look. And this company makes them in all gold and all silver with one side glossy and the other a satin look which would be my first choice, but so far they do not have it in all Rose Gold. I have shoulder length hair and they barely show. I might switch to a dangle shape instead. However they are truly beautiful and rich looking. If I had gobs of money I would definitely keep them! I have to decide....it's hard to know what to do. I have a ring wth rose gold and would like earrings of same color to match."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are very nice, substantial, yet light-weight earrings. It's great \"notice me\" size, but not over-done. I wear them frequently.However, the current price is appalling. I purchased them in 2007 for under 50 clams! Insanely low-priced then, but insanely high-priced now. No way would I pay the asking price for these, much less the list. URGH! These earring previously listed for just over one hundred, and I got them on a one day deal for just over 40.These are nice earrings, but don't over-pay for these! They should be going in the 100-150 range. Wait for a deal when there is additional money off. Increased gold prices or not. These are not worth 250. Trust me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My goggles fit in the case, but it's a tight fit.  I wish the case were just a bit bigger (longer and deeper) to make it easier when putting the goggles in.  Once you wrestle with the goggles though and get them in, the case does it's job.  I've had these goggles in my gym bag for 6 months and they still look fantastic.  If TYR reads these reviews, it'd be nice if if you would put a second little zippered pocket on them where you could keep a small bottle of anti-fog solution.Speaking of anti-fog solution, don't forget to buy yourself a bottle of JAWS Quick Spit to keep your goggles from fogging up. Happy swimming!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So much that I went back and bought a second pair in case they got discontinued.  I hate putting shoes on, so the slide style is great for me.  The fit is perfect, the support is fabulous, and they must look really cool, because I have had perfect strangers in the park approach me to ask me where I got them.I'm a little ambivalent about the pink bow issue ever since it was brought to my attention.  But I can live with it in exchange for how pain-free my orthopedic feet are when I wear them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like the shoes, a lot.  The only issue I have is the top, instep is very snug.  It is making my foot sore.  I think it will loosen up a little, so for now I am only wearing the shoes part time.  I needed these to wear in the house, for some support while I am doing my normal house chores, so I just take them off for a bit, then go back to them later.  I hope they loosen up, I really like New Balance shoes, have been purchasing this brand for years."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am an adult woman who chose this watch to wear.  It has several features that I wanted.  The elastic band is far more comfortable than a metal expansion band and is the most comfortable type of band I've ever worn.  The watch is light weight, has numbers big enough for me to read without my putting on my glasses, and the dial lights up with a push of the button.  The only thing I don't like is that the second hands are lizards and do not allow from exact tracking.  They seem to be mainly for cuteness."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "when I first bought it I was afraid he wouldn't like it, since it wasn't Iron man, or anything of that sort. But he was so excited that he made me write down the table chart for multiples of fives for the living room so he can reference it and find the time. The watch also is glow in the dark! which i didn't know. and its waterproof....he still hasn't taken it off. He said &#34;my daddy has a watch, and now I have a watch. Mine is better though because I have lizards.&#34;"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased this for my 2 year old niece who always wants to wear our watches.  It's a very cute watch, the lizards move across the face like a second hand.  The band is elastic, so once it's fitted for a small wrist you can just pull it off without re-sizing.  Another pro, Timex kids watches come with a ''warranty'' that if the child loses the watch within 12 months of the purchase date, you can buy another for $10."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This was a great tool for teaching my children how to tell time.  Too many kids can only read digital numbers; you give them an analog watch or clock and they're lost.  I bought this for my five year old son.  He learned very quickly how to tell time on it.  He wore it 24 hours a day in the pool, sledding, running and playing. The lens got pretty scratched up and the wrist band stretched some, but it was a great watch... until he lost it.  I would strongly recommend this watch for young children."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So, yes, I suppose I'm going through my second childhood...but, really, I had good reason to order this watch for kids!  (I'm 68)  First of all I like lizards.  But beside that fetish, I needed a watch that is COMFORTABLE to wear, easy to get on, won't overpower my skinny old wrist and that is inexpensive enough so that if I smash the thing doing barn chores, I won't feel any great loss.  This little cutie absolutely rates top notch on all counts.  I can't tell you how many people have complemented my choice...perhaps they're also waiting for me to wear my underwear on the outside of my clothes, too....but hey....if you can't be &#34;different&#34; you're just another old lady who rides horseback. And it keeps perfect time, too!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have always been a fan of the 501 fit, I wore them exclusively through high school.  Funny that doesn't even really date me, they are a classic.I was very pleased to see that the styling was slightly updated and this turned out to be an even better pair of jeans than I expected.The one downside I found was the button fly.  This didn't bother me soo much when I was younger but now I would much prefer a zipper to dealing with buttons.  Perhaps it is because I generally wear a belt now and it is very difficult to do the buttons up without undoing the belt and top button."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just like always, if your from the west coast you know what I mean. Perfect fit as always but, the days of taking them home to wash and shrink them after purchase (shrink to fit) is still available But. the thick LEVI denim is a thing of the past. I remember back in late 60's, early 70's these pants would stand on there own when you would get them out of the washer they would chaff the hair off your legs all for $14.99, those days are gone. But with Global warming happening there a great pant and there priced right for the times."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Faded Glory Jeans fit me better. It's difficult to find these in the 33 x 33 which is what I wear. This is a great experience I've had buying jeans of ebay. They are in great condition and easier to find on there than in stores. I would like to find darker ones and find ones that fit even better than Faded Glory. The FG fit much better most noticeably in the seat. see my video where i tell more and what I do to prep new jeans before i wear them and b4 and after each wash at youtube b29349 jeans."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am 57 and have been wearing these jeans since high school..I started out a 30/30..I am currently a 33/30..While my size has not changed all that much these jeans have...They were one of the oldest American companies and it is sad to see the denegration of an icon..Hell years ago these pants were used as a sobriety check..If you couldn't handle the buttons  on the rest room call you knew you had drank to much..Zippers were for sissy's! In summation don't expect quality anymore however if you need a sobriety check these will still fit that bill.."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "First, these jeans are quite comfortable. But.... I didn't read the description closely enough. When I hurriedly put them on preparing to leave the house for an appointment I was taken aback to discover that they had a button fly. I just went with them figuring that since I wore this type when I was a kid (before zippers were firmly established), I can deal with it. We'll see how that plays out. I do prefer ordering online since it is a 60 mile trek to go to the &#34;big city&#34; but sometimes being able to look closely before purchasing can be a good thing. Oh well......."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The traditional 501 has always been a favorite of mine.The jeans I received are identical to previous 501's except for one thing:The &#34;rise&#34;, the distance betwen the crotch and the upper edge of the pants, is smaller than it has always been, by about 1/2 inch. It may seem as a small difference, but I noticed it right away, and then confirmed by taking a tape measure to my old 501's and this one.This may not matter to some people, but it makes a difference to me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been wearing Levi's 505's since the 1960's. Recently Levi's changed the style of 505's from \"regular fit\" to \"straight fit\". The straight fit has a lower waist that I don't like.I reluctantly tried 501's. I was nervous about the button fly.However, the results were great; I really love 501's now. They fit me better than even the old style of 505's. The material feels stronger than the 505's. The button fly isn't a problem; just undo the middle buttons when you need access, there is no need to unbutton the top."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered these on the grounds that I needed a taller size. I loved the color, but they came up only midway up my buttcrack. When I did the 'crouch down' test they revealed much, much more. The legs and fit indicated they were not original fitting as the leg stayed the same width all the way down the leg. All in all, what I ordered was completely different from what I thought I was ordering. If you're a tall guy like me, don't get them.Other than that, I'm giving them two stars rather than one for nice quality and color."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Of course it's nice when things change for the better and just as sweet when the small close to perfect things in life remain unchanged by time. This is the case with these Levi's 501 jeans.For decades my favorite jeans of all time. Countless designers and brands have tried to tap into the 501's iconic popularity but at the end of the day have always failed to do so.These are exactly how I remember them:* Heavy Denim* Re-enforced flawless stitching on all pockets, hems, waist line and inner leg.* Solid brass rivets on pockets* The classic brass rivet button flyOrdered in white these arrived quickly, wrapped in plastic with tags of authenticity. The fit and feel is marvelous and the price is sensational. Macy's and other stores sell 501's for twice this amount. The slim fit isn't constrictive nor are they pre-washed so expect a few washings before they feel like a second skin.Highest Recommendation!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love 501 jeans, they fit just right in all the right places and I prefer button fly to zipper.  Note that the polished black is a bit different than the usual black jean (there is a plain black 501 as well).  The polished finish produces a shiny, more finished jean look which means that wrinkles are sharper and more noticeable -- the fabric is stiffer than the plain black jean.  If that happens, the tried and true technique of spraying the jeans lightly with water, wearing them or giving them a quick press will help.The stiffness of the fabric is part of the clean and neat appearance but unlike other 501s this also seems to reduce the &#34;give&#34; in the fabric and makes the fit tighter and slightly uncomfortable at first -- hoping this will work itself out after a few washes."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've worn 501s for a very long time and they seem to be getting harder to find.  Especially in my size.  It seems I'm shrinking back to my old waist size (yay!) so I ordered a couple pair at that size and a couple pair 2 inches fatter.  The fatter ones don't fit and it was easy to return them to amazon.  - NOTE: I made sure that amazon was the seller! -To sum it up, these were some new pants to replace some worn out ones.  Nothing exciting there other than it was really easy to click some buttons and get exactly what I was expecting.  Perfect."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Levi's 501 jeans for literally half a century and the quality of the fabric has gone downhill to the point where a pair now lasts me less than a year before tears appear. I know that the stone wash type are actually tumbled with rocks and are not going to wear very long but I do expect the standard jeans to last a lot longer than a matter of weeks before having holes in the jeans from the fabric having worn thin. Dislike paying 10x as much and getting 1/10 the wear of the Levi's of the past."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I needed an inexpensive watch to wear when in business attire and I normally have terrible issues with watches because my wrists are so small. However, this watch is absolutely wonderful. The band has an adjusting clasp that moves smoothly down the band.  There are little grooves for the clasp to grasp (didn't mean to rhyme) so it doesn't slide if too much pressure is put on it. The actual clasps are intertwined so double the protect. You do not need to worry about catching it on something and the watch falling off without noticing.  In general, the design is simple but elegant. THe black face with the small white cystals make it very sytlish. I'm extremely please with this product."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Title says it all. (This is the third Skagen I've purchased. I like the small, light design.)Also, some reviews of these watches say that the clasp tends to undo itself too easily, but I think that the current version of the watch has corrected that problem.Good: Keeps time well, comfortable, looks great as a dress watch *** BUT I SUGGEST THAT YOU ONLY WEAR IT WITH A DARK SUIT ***Bad: I've had it for a while, and mainly use it as a dress watch, and I have had nothing to complain about so far. In terms of color coordinating, its dark band and face means that is not as versatile a dress watch as the silver Skagen, so if you are have one watch, then stick with silver."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The watch is very attractive.  I do like the fact that it is so thin.  However, after receiving it I have found that I prefere a solid blue face as compared to this more modern style of the blue appearing differently depending on how the light happens to be hitting it.  This is personal taste, I just found that for me I don't particularly care for it.  It is a very beautiful watch and extremely light on the wrist, so even though I found I don't personally care for the style after receiving it I still gave it five stars.  I will be giving it to a friend for a holiday gift."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The watch is really stylish. I wear it for casual-dressy ocassions and get compliments on it often.At the beginning I could not adjust the band (one size fits many) to fit my wrist and have it lock into place properly. Therefore I could not close the clasp when I put it on my wrist. I took it to a local jeweler to adjust properly (only charged $5). If you have difficulty also don't force it. Take it to a jeweler - you'll be happy you did.And then, the clasp mechanism itself is a bit complex - putting the watch on and taking it off is a bit tricky - it takes patience and some getting used to. After wearing it a dozen times I haven't quite mastered it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have had a Skagen 800 series watch that I liked very much. The only way to replace the band when the black starts to turn silver is to send it back to Skagen in Texas for replacement. That costs $32 and includes anything else you want done, like changing the battery. I really love the watch and felt is was worth it. However, I felt so naked without it, and they said it takes 2-3 weeks to return, that I bought another one.The diameter of this watch is smaller, it is very thin and perfect for slender wrists like mine. I love the band. You adjust it once and it stays that size forever, looks great and doesn't absorb perspiration like leather. The color is rich and reflective and goes with everything. If you like a thin watch, rather than the big bulky ones that are so popular now, this is for you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've had this watch for about a month and a half as of 9/4/06 and it has kept accurate time, I compare it to my Casio Waveceptor watch (MTG920DA-1) which calibrates itself every day.The dial is a beautiful blue color, which catches the light nicely. The easily adjusted band is comfortable, and the entire watch and band are so thin and light on my wrist.While I don't wear it every day, it has shown no signs of wear and has a good quality feel to it, though thin and light (once again).This watch will look elegant on any wrist, it's simple: no date or sweep second hand, but eye-catching."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "You won't find a better watch for the money. I don't think there IS a better watch. This is the most comfortable, reliable, long-wearing, easily adjustable watch I have ever owned. I have a $900 Movado that I never wear because the clasp always comes loose. Besides, I'm so happy with my Titanium Skagen I never want to wear anything else. The Skagen mesh bands are the most comfortable thing in the world against your skin.My only negative remark is don't buy the black. I had that one before and the black coloring wore off where the band meets the watchface, and it looked shabby. This watch I have now is all Titanium, nothing to rub off."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The Skagen 233LTTN men's watch is good-looking and so thin that you barely notice it under a dress shirt cuff.  The band is easy to adjust and of course it keeps great time.  I bought one of the &#34;in&#34; big, clunky watches and had to give it up because it was just too uncomfortable to wear under a shirt and suit jacket.  The Skagen is a dream - as comfortable as the old Universal-Geneve I used to own and just as handsome.  This is a great watch!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Pros:  It's gorgeous.  Silver face and silver mesh band goes with anything.  Looks much more expensive than it is.  Beautiful, sparkly round diamond-like chips for the numbers.  Lays flat against the wrist - not bulky and very comfortable.  Easily adjustable band.  Keeps good time.Cons:  No deal-breakers here, just things you might want to know ~ Not waterproof so you can't wear it in the shower. I have long hair and every once in a while it will catch in the mesh band. And no date display, if that's important to you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just received the watch recently and it's just gorgeous. Really very beautiful. I do wish it had a second hand but I knew it didn't when I bought it. Another reviewer mentioned that the closed clasp when you wear it doesn't form a circle around your wrist. It's true, it's kind of square-ish where the clasp is and at first it bothered me but it doesn't anymore. I can't see it unless I turn my wrist over and it doesn't feel weird or anything. Just a minor thing anyway. The watch is not too small, not too big and is thin and sleek. I get compliments on it. I love it!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have purchased different brands and sizes of Knee Highs.  My legs are pretty wide at 200 pounds; but these knee highs are supposed to fit someone much bigger and heavy than I.  NOT TRUE.  I had to return them and have given up trying to find a pair of stockings/knee highs that I can wear without being tortured.  I am very short (5') so it's impossible to find regular stockings that won't choke my waist, and the same goes for the knee highs.  I have tried &#34;Q&#34; sizes to no avail, the elastic at the top is always terribly uncomfortable.  If you read this and have any ideas, please contact me? Thanks!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just as beautiful as the photo, and provides great support! I did take the advice of other reviewers, and bought a size down (normally a 34C, and I bought a 32C). It fit great in that sense. However, I am a bit on the petite side (5' 2\") and the bottom of the torsolette kind of juts out--wouldn't look good under my wedding gown. I am returning it, but do recommend it if you have a slightly longer torso. I wish they made a petite size!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Love, love, love this cosmetic bag! I can't say enough positive things about this bag. It works perfect for my needs. I have always found it frustrating digging through bags trying to find the bottle I need. This solves that problem being able to where everything is at a glance. The smaller pockets at the top fit things like band-aids, chap stick, and nail clippers while the middle sized ones are the perfect size for travel sized sample bottles. The larger pockets at the bottom are perfect for several larger 12 oz bottles such as sunblock and hairspray. The bag then folds in half to lay flat fitting perfect in a carry on."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The item is not as pictured.  I just looked at the picture again.  The bottom plastic case are big enough to hold powder in the picture.  It is only big enough to hold small items.Also it has a horrible smell something like burning plastic.  I have aired it out while waiting for the seller to respond to me and it is still as bad.  Another review mentioned it.I found the seller's responses insulting.  I would never buy them from them again.All in All I find 99% of my purchases from Amazon are great.  I am a dedicated Amazon buyer and if I was Amazon I would removethis seller as they bring down the quality of Amazon's image."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Beautiful mens shoe.  I ordered these for my husband as an everyday I love you gift and they went over very well!  He loves them and has pretty much worn them daily since.  They are a beautiful rich brown color that go great with everything.  He says they are comfortable and likes the style.  I like the three hole lace for him better that the other styles that only have two because he wears a size 11 it really helps break up the long look of the shoe.  Some of them just look silly in the front and make a mens foot look like a long bill.  These are much younger looking than the original style, but are still classy!  Great purchase and I know he will have them for a very long time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I do a lot of field work across the world and have heard nothing but good things about these sandles - however for me, I can't even wear them. After 1 month, they just stank. Now, I don't have particularly smelly feet. And can't smell any other shoes, but these are bad. Others people with the same shoes tell me that as well (although they still like them). And I found them fairly uncomfortable. I remember that Teva's sandles, when they first came out, also smelled, and then they made them different. Oh, well."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are the original high quality Keen Sandals. Heavy gauge sole, strong construction, compressible foot bed for comfort. After being to the store yesterday where they have a display of new Keen sandals I was appalled at how poorly constructed the new version is...the plastic is akin to the stuff they use on flip flops, the upper construction enters the shoe a full 1/4 from the edge, overall a cheap shadow of these shoes. Hopefully Keen will not go the way of so many other shoe companies and cheapen their shoes to the point of undesirability. You may want to consider an extra pair if you hope to find them again in the future."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have very poor circulation in my feet, so they are cold all the time (really bad in the winter). I got some of these to wear around the house to keep my toes from going numb. They are really comfy, and they keep my feet warm :)I also use them when I hunt, and they work great. They don't make my feet feel wet if I sweat in them, and they are comfy all day.They are holding up really well too, I have had them over a year (3 pairs), and they still look/feel like new socks"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "After searching around and doing a little research, I found out when Camp Dry changed the packaging they made the new fabric protector with a Blue top.  This is the same formula as my favorite of all time the RED Top...It is the best (I have tried them all) waterproofer for anything that is fabric, it is also to my knowledge the only one approved for re waterproofing your Gore Tex jackets.Almost all waterproof fabrics will lose the coating through washing and getting wet, so you can do two things with this product:Waterproof something that is not very waterproof  (Flannel shirt, cotton, fleece hat, cotton gloves,)OR add more Waterproof to something (Jacket, Tent, Unbrella, Shoes,)The OLD BLACK top cans are now Green they are best for Boots and heavier stuff like canvasKiwi Camp Dry, Heavy Duty Water Repellent, 12ozI hope you find this helpful, comment with any questions..."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this undershirt. I bought one (along with the leggins) last winter to wear under my XC ski clothing. Next I took it on a 5wk walk across Spain this spring. Although I didn't need to wear it much on the walk I lent it to several of my friends who were walking with me and who needed a little extra warmth! My sister was one and I promised her one for her birthday! I found it quite roomy and could have probably bought a medium for myself....hence I bought the medium for my sister. It can be squished into a ziplock bag taking no space in your pack. It is warm and washes and dries quickly overnight. All in all a very useful item for travelling!Jenn, BC"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love these Thermasilks as they can be worn under clothing without being caught up and they are so surprisingly warm.I would like more colours though. An ocean turquoise, a soft coral, a baby pink and powder blue.From crutch to waist they could for my height be another 2 inches higher, I am tall and all legs with a high waist, 5'10&#34;.I love these silks are long in the legs.The tops could be longer in the arms, another 1'5&#34;. minimum. My arms are very long.The silk does though tend to get caught on rough fingers and jewellery easily so take note. I will be buying them again.I will let you know the life span once I am nearly there. Could be a while.Thank you Thermasilk!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This product has made me very happy, although at first impressions, it looks too thin and sheer to be true. I replaced all my merino long johns with this as I developed an allergy from wearing too much merino too frequently, and now I can't touch them at all. Anyway, this brand is great, and I have also bought the equivalent tops as my base layer as well, they are warm and really light. My husband has heaps of these too and he really likes the range (long johns, long sleeve and short sleeve silk base layers). As the fabric is delicate, a little care during washing would be good. Otherwise, it washes well and dries very quickly unlike wool products."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I live a pretty active life - so I really needed a great pair walking shoes that I could also wear for casual dress.  These looked great on line and got great reviews, but it's always a &#34;shot in the dark&#34; when you buy shoes on line.  When these arrived I put them on right away, walked about 6 feet and realized that they not only fit, but they felt really good on my feet.  I didn't even have to break them in - I just immediately went on a 2-mile walk and felt like I was walking on marshmallows.  (That's a good thing!)  These shoes are light weight and my husband says they look good on my feet, too.  (I agree.)  I am a size 8 medium and these ran true to size.  Oh - And did I mention they're vegan, too.  Big plus for me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I feel similarly about this item as I do about Communism: Seems good in theory, but in reality, it falls apart (quite literally)! I was very excited about this item, ordered it, and it arrived with the hinges already broken, w/the screws fallen out. Then, because I thought it was just a fluke, I ordered ANOTHER one, and the exact same thing happened, only this time, half of the back side of the lid (near the screws go) was totally split. So basically, all this item did for me was cause me a bunch of time and trouble to return. It's tempting, but my advice is find something else- stay away from this!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I originally ordered a Large Tall. I'm 6'4&#34; with a 42&#34; chest, 34&#34; waist, 190 lbs, and wear a 16/36 in dress shirts. The Large Tall was perfect for length of sleeves and waist, but I could easily have gained another 100 lbs to fill it out.  I returned it and got the Medium Tall. It is MUCH better. Gives me enough room to wear a couple layers under and looks more like the guy in the picture with his hand in his pocket. The Large gave me enough room that I wouldn't be surprised if I could wear the Medium underneath it. This is a quality constructed jacket that should last for years."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This watch has everything I was looking for.  It is clear and concise, has day/date feature and Indaglo so I can see it in the dark.  I travel a lot and don't have to turn on the light at night.  I have a collector watch I am retiring and have a band I wanted to transfer to the new one.  Fine.  I read a complaint from someone regarding setting the day.  To do this you wind the watch backwards and the day will change correctly.  Otherwise, you will mess everything up."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I haven't seen an analog Timex Easy Reader priced this low for the past five years.  It's the perfect professor's watch because:1.  Only professors wear them (students have abandoned wrist watches in favor of cell phones, iPods and other digital devices).2.  Besides providing that dependable Timex time, it offers both the day of the week and the date (I'm just beginning to master the year and month without assistance).3.  If the watch is misplaced (the difference between a professor and an elephant), the cost of replacement is not prohibitively high.  (The same goes for repairs which, once you've factored in the drive to Walmart, are also not cost effective.)Thank you, Amazon.  Life is perfect."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was looking at watches with my friend and when she came across this one, I wanted it too. Little did I know she had bought it for me for Christmas!!! :)  You can't beat a Timex! It's a Men's watch and although I am a woman, it looks good on my dainty wrist. Large face watches are still in and this looks really classic, simple and stylish enough for everyday. I had to adjust the band but that was nominal in price. I love the date/day mode as well. The blue face is such a nice color and I think will look great in the summer too! Can't say enough&#8230; it just a great watch, fashionable and a great price! Enjoy!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wasn't sure if I was going to like this as I was buying it online, but it is the perfect size and I love the big numbers and  ... my husband keeps trying to steal it! I have relatively small hands and a narrow wrist so was concerned about the size of the watch face because I know some of them are rather large (for a man's wrist) ... this one is perfect!TIP: I measured the top of my wrist to get an idea of what size watch face would work."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, the strap is black but the dial itself is brown. It's very cute! great for simple outfits and it even has the date. The light up mechanism itself, is a button on the side that you pressed. I thought it would be the numbers itself so when I'm groggy in the middle of the night, I can just half-open my one eye, and I will be able to tell the time, but no, I have to push the button. Maybe I'm spoiled by technologies, but it's not hard to just make it glow, right? ah, what do i know."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this watch -- it is the perfect face size for my wrist and thus far has been extremely durable and reliable. I've had this watch and used it daily for several months now and it has surpassed my medium-low expectations. I've dropped it and knocked it around a bit, and it has held up great. Keeps good time, and the band is still going strong despite daily use and abuse. Worn this swimming a few times as well with no problems. Great watch, and looks a bit more classy in reality than it does in the picture."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The picture of the watch makes it look big with a very wide band. I was hesitant to order it because I thought it wouldn't look like a women's watch.When it arrived I was pleased to see that the band is less than an inch wide at the largest end. The watch is a beauty in that the numbers have bright (very small) silver arrows that point to the numbers. I like this feature because it only takes a quick glance to read the time. The face is fairly easy to read but really shines when Indiglow button is pushed the face then becomes a pretty shade of aqua and is a fairly bright light.While this a &#34;casual&#34; wear watch I like the fact that the matte black surround doesn't clash with rings and wrist jewelry.It light-weight and comfortable. I would buy this again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like the look of this watch very much, but 3 problems:  1) the band is relatively short, and 2) the straps to hold the band down (2) disintegrated after about 2 months, and 3) while the watch is waterproof, using it while swimming fewer than 6 times has resulted a faded and worn looking watch band. I'd buy it again if the band could be longer and there could be a more durable or perhaps a metal bracket to hold down the end of the band."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love these Timex Watches, the face is a bone colour and the numbers are black and easy to see.The minute and hour hand glow and the indiglo is the best for at night or in the dark. I really likethe red minute hand which on my watch, actually lines up with the minute increments on the face.I found this model to be very comfy to wear, I always prefer leather straps and this one isnice and soft.The watch is neither too large or too small on my wrist, a perfect fit.The Easy Set Alarm is just that, easy! And loud enough too!If you need a watch for reminding you of things throughout the day, thenthis is the one for you.I don't care if this watch/battery only lasts for 12 months, because I buy a newwatch every year on my birthday, but I'm sure it will take the knocks I dish outjust like my other Timex."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm wearing this watch right now and I can say this is the best watch I have ever owned. It may not be fancy, but it is durable and functional. I've had it for 6 months and as a fishing guide in Yellowstone National Park, it has held up to everything mother nature could possibly throw at it. Snow, rain, sleet, days of hot sun, and up to 100 feet of water. I am also a diver and when it says water resistant to 100 meters, it means it. This is now my go-to diving watch because the buttons are so easy to push, even with bulky gloves on.The band is surprisingly durable and the velcro snaps together like the day I got it.The only negative is that the face scratches pretty easily, but even with the scratches the time and numbers are extremely legible.If this watch ever does give out, I will 100% buy another."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got this for my six year old as a way to reinforce the need to learn how to tell time. I was surprised with how large the watch seemed right out of the box but it is very easy to adjust the band to fit even the smallest wrist. The face is the perfect size for kids to see. The hands are labeled &#34;minutes&#34; and &#34;hours&#34; and of course the hours are marked around the face. The one complaint I have with the watch is that after you hit 30 on the minute labels, the minutes count down back down to zero so instead of saying &#34;35 past the hour&#34; they must read it as &#34;25 til the next hour&#34; -- not sure if this is the standard way of teaching time but we've had to adjust our thinking a little bit to help our 6 year old interpret the time after 30. Overall I am happy with the watch."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have had several Timex's over the years and they've all held up.  Timex watches usually outlast the bands they come with!  We bought this for our daughter who was learning to tell time in First grade.  All in all it's a good watch and she likes the look of it.  The only complaint we have is that the numbers for the seconds are really small, making it hard to read them. In a perfect world, those numbers would be a bit larger.  All in all, a great watch for a young one learning to tell time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a really good looking ladies watch, plus it has my favorite feature of pushing the stem and having the watch face light up.  This is especially great during a boring movie, play, opera, etc., to tell you how much time you have left before you can get out.  Or going on a trip and waking up in the middle of the night and being able to see the time.  The gold finish with the pearlized face gives it a nice, expensive look.  The band is nice, but I'd like to see a grosgrain band for a dressier look.  All over, This watach gets an A+ from me, because of the price and the great look combined."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Bought for my son for his work boots and gloves.  It dried his boots overnight.  There is no fan, so no noise, and he just put it in his bedroom using the floor mounts.  We had another boot drier with a fan that we used in the garage but this design is much better.  You would think this would do nothing because you can touch the prongs when it is on and it barely feels warm.  When I put my hand up inside when the boot was mounted on one of them though it was much warmer, but still not overly hot.  Pretty neat how it works."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These stockings by Leg Avenue are indeed very nice.  For the purposes of full disclosure I will admit that I initially bought them to wear with a (I was a nineteenth century Parisian courtesan!) costume.  However, since then, I have found that they also work great for everyday use.  I have worn them to work and also for more formal events.  My beautiful stockings have not let me down yet!  Great price, perfect fit!  What more can a modern woman ask for?"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "All Carhartts are sized differently no matter where you buy them and always have.  Be careful that you know what size you wear for each different style before ordering.  We knew ahead of time which style size we wanted, and amazon saved us the 60 mile drive to the nearest CalRanch to purchase these.  This particular style is the closest to the hub's actual size.  They are PLENTY long.  That being said. Carhartts are the only pants I buy my husband.  They are as tough as they say. You can walk through a field of burrs and not feel them, and they are great in the snow.  Highly recommended as long as you know your size, because EVERY STYLE IS DIFFERENT."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Carhartt for several years. I usually buy them at my local store but the Amazon price is $10 less and my local store would not match. The last 5 pairs of these pants I have purchased, including this pair have all been very bad on size consistency. I have worn the same size for years and up until recently there was little to no variation. But this last year or so has been pretty bad. I have seen variation's of at least an inch in inseam & waist. For me that is the difference of pants dragging on the ground or practically falling off my waist! I'm not sure what is going on in the quality control department, but I'm going to be trying the Duluth Fire hose pants now to see if they are more consistent. My co-worker swears by them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've had this watch for several months now and I really like it. The second hand is nice for timing things, and it is very easy to read the time. It's also very simple so it doesn't compete with other jewelery. However, as other reviews stated, this watch is VERY small. My writs are almost exactly 6 inches around and I wear this watch on the third-largest size, so it definitely wouldn't go more than ~6.5 inches around your wrist. Other than that, it's very nice, delicate, and simple."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Purchased this sleek looking watch for my wife.  She is hard on watches and I didnt want a $1500 Omega that would be scratched and destroyed a year later.  This watch exudes classic femininity and looks stylish in work, play or sporting environments.  Very reasonable cost with the only downside that it is water resistant but not water proof.  It can probably withstand a shower but obviously not diving in the ocean.  My wife received it and enjoys it, so happy all around.  Would buy another one a few years down the road, when the current one gives out.  Nice buy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I looked for a long time for a 'starter' watch for my daughter.  I thought this was the best of what I could find.  First the pros:  the numbers are large, the second hand is a butterfly, and it lights up.  Cons:  the wrist band is adjustable which really means that it is never tight enough and slides around a lot.  I was hoping she would want to wear it every day, but she really doesn't like that it's not secure on her wrist."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "We have had many of these watches over the course of the last 13 years and 4 kidsI LOVE the following :-if they loose it, Timex will replace it-it is analog....kids need to learn this before going digital..it's vital!-it's sooo cute-the price...quality,  and it is able  get wet so the child does not have to take on and off constantlyMy only gripe on this watch is the band mechanism to secure the length of the strap. It seems to wiggle over time, or come loose. I wish it was able to hold it a bit &#34; tighter&#34; . We graduate our kids to a Timex Ironman digital once this has ran it's course."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These watches are wonderful for children learning the nuance of time.  There are small numbers at the edges reminding them that if the big hand is at 10, it is 50 minutes after the hour, etc.  They are comfortable, and inexpensive enough that the kids can wear them to school without worry.  They are NOT water proof, so need to be taken off before showering or swimming, but can endure almost all other activities.  My granddaughters wear theirs always and I believe it helped them to learn time quickly and painlessly.  The batteries are long lasting.  They come in a wide variety of patterns and colors for both girls and boys.  You really can't go wrong with these watches."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Timex Kids' Color Indiglo Hearts Stretch Band Watch #T7B111 - I have been wearing these kids' watches during the summer for several years. They are inexpensive and have cloth straps, so when the straps wear out, I feel no regret about tossing them and buying replacements. I got several in different colors to coordinate with my wardrobe. When the weather cools off, I put them away until next summer. They've been very reliable and easy and cheap to get the batteries repaired, including at Wal-Mart."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'd give 3.5 stars if I could.  They look great and seem well made. they are super lightweight which makes them comfy but if you have sensitive feet like I do, there is one thing that you may not like. The inside footbed has a pattern on it and since the footbed is a molded raised material, this bothers me some.  I prefer a smooth surface but again, it is because I am sensitive and it makes the bottom of my foot sore just like if you had tiny debris under your foot would.  The super light weight though really is fabulous. I also like that it has good toe room so your big toe does not rub on top."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have several pair of a no longer made Keen \"flip style\" which I love, but I love this shoe even better.  It has the same supportive sole, the toe protection and the secureness of the heel strap.  I love the flips for easy on, but for really walking around - this shoe is perfect for me.I have a normal to slightly high arch and a squarish foot.  I ordered my normal Keen size 9 and fit was perfect.  I threw caution to the wind and wore these 3 days in a row after receiving them - most of the days, tromping around doing errands.  I had 1 spot that was resolved by a nail trim and that was that.  I expected more irritation from the webbing but NOT!A bit more effort to put on than a slide or flip but not that much so they work for a quick out with my dog.I bought these on a \"special\" and wish I'd bought another or 2 more pair."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, so you're not going to be the belle of the ball by a long shot in these sandals...not even close...but that's not what they are intended for in the first place.  I just joined a rowing team and everyone on the team highly recommended purchasing a pair of Keens.  Our team color is purple, hence the color I selected (they are not as &#34;purple&#34; as pictured).  I took them out of the box, wore them around the house for a few hours, and was really surprised at how comfy they are.  In fact, I forgot I had them on. There isn't that &#34;newness&#34; or &#34;breaking in&#34; phase. They fit perfectly--and I did take the advice of others to order one half size up (a definite!).  I love them!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These shoes meet the requirement of my foot surgeon!  This is a very difficult task!  They are very comfortable on my feet, the look great and they are very safe!  I love these shoes!  This was a very good by for me!  I have worn them all around while traveling to the Grand Canyon!  Believe me there was a lot of walking to do!  I felt protected, safe, comfortable and attractive all in one!  Amazing shoes!  Thank you!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Bought these to go to Bali in February since a friend highly recommended them.  Decided to first wear these on a weekend vacation to Monterey and Carmel with lots of walking.  I put them on straight out of the box (with thin socks as it was a cool day) and walked miles in complete comfort.  I saw the other reviews that said go up a size but I ordered my regular size and they fit fine.  I usually wear a 7 or 71/2 and got the 71/2.  They are a bit wide in the toe box and I have very high arches but so far it's been OK.  Love the Sweet grape orchid color.  Cute and fun shoes.  They are going to Bali with me!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this sandal! This is my third pair. I wear them for rafting a few times per week all summer and am wearing a pair for house shoes right now. Heck, I even wear them for dress shoes! The fit is spot on. The heel height is a bit higher than many sandals, which I like, and I'm able to glue a lift in the right shoe for my short leg. They are very durable: The ones I've worn for over a year are have the leather straps (not designated H2O, but &#34;waterproof&#34;), like the pair being reviewed, and have held up exceptionally well against frequent exposure to water and sand. The soles are sticky enough for walking on rocks, and the heels of my older pair show very little wear, even though I walk on pavement with them quite a bit. The jester red/persimmon color is very pretty and matches many of my river, yoga and casual outfits."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "For years I resisted purchasing Keen's shoes because they are expensive and frankly, somewhat ugly. But in the summer when I need to do a bit of walking, I find that flipflops or regular sandals just aren't comfortable enough for me if I have to walk or be on my feet for more than an hour. What I've been doing is to wear a pair of leather Keds which are comfortable but in the Texas heat, I'd really rather not. These sandals are fantastic and very much worth the money to me! I get the benefit of a sandal with the long-term comfort and sturdiness of a more substantial shoe."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I actually bought these from another site because of a 20% coupon code and free shipping,  although I did have to wait longer.....but anyways....Might I say this blue color is fabulous and uber cute! !!My feet are slightly wide. .. not wide enough for wide shoes,  but sometimes look puffy in mediums.  Mt size is a 9.I would say the 9.5 is perfect fit.  Not too snug,  even after walking 2 miles and my feet swell a bit,  they were not too snug and still felt good. Plenty of toe room too.The bottoms are a little more plasticy feeling,so to speak, than I expected but still comfortable.As a woman who has made the decision comfort is a priority but I still want a little cute,  I'm really happy with this purchase, perfect for the chic hippie,  lolBottom line. ..I world suggest 1/2 size larger and they are fine for a slightly wider foot.Happy Shopping :-)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is the 6th pair of Keen shoes I have owned but my first pair of sandals. I love them. I tried on all the different styles in the store and these were the most comfortable. They are great for walking in the summer because they offer comfort and support but are vented more than sneakers and IMO look better with shorts.I wore these to Sleeping Bear Dunes on our vacation last week (big mistake) and sand got pretty heavily imbedded in the foot beds. I took a toothbrush to them when we got home and it all came out pretty effortlessly. I love that they are machine washable too.Another great thing about Keens is that they come in size 10.5!  Most brands skip 10.5 and go right to 11. I am a 10.5 and these run true to size. 11 would be too big.I love these every bit as much as the shoes I've purchased. I wear out every pair I get, I use them so much."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I had my other pair of Keen's for 3 years and I wore them almost daily weather in Chicago permitting.  Well, one of my doc's took a look at them and told me I needed a new pair, the shoes were worn out on the bottom. That was last Wed evening. I ordered my new pair on Thursday and the shoes arrived on Friday. Amazon prime is the best deal ever!Okay, back to the shoes. I wear a 71/2 in shoes but read the reviews and ordered up to a 8. 8 fits perfectly.  I chose the color that was the cheapest, yes, some of the colors were $100 and well, I don't think a color is worth an extra $30 bucks.  My shoes were $67 bucks and I hope they last 3 years!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a shoe for travel, I read other reviews and decided it was what I needed for a visit to Easter Island.Sand, water, rocks, hiking, slick rocks and such, heat, comfort.  Wow these are just great for everything and my feet are happy at the end of the day.  Remember to put suntan lotion you the tops of your feet as mine are now look like a checker board from the sun.  I took them on to Thailand and even in the city they were great.  You can't go wrong with these sandals."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Got this and thought it could not be warm since it is thin.  Man, I had it on for a few minutes and was HOT.  Great Coat, warm and tough.UPDATE: After several days of backache I had to get rid of this coat.  It is very warm, but the sizes are a bit larger than the cotton version and due to the material, this coat does not bend or fold easily.  Basically every time I sat down, the top of the coat was pushing my shoulder up and hurting my neck.  The hood is nice when you're wearing it, but when you try to push it back, it hits the back of your head like a nail."}

That is not a negative, but you need to know that and buy something else unless you are really going to be out for long periods in VERY cold weather.  3) It is very big and stiff and bulky.

This jacket is very warm and makes a good winter work jacket for me here in connecticut. This is NOT a light spring or fall jacket. 45 degrees and up you sweat. Its very tough and the arms are long enough. The hood is insulated so its very warm. You do not need any kind of winter hat when wearing this jacket with the hood up. My only problem is the zipper is hard to zip for the first couple of inches but its very slowly getting better with time. Im not sure if all the zippers are like this or just mine."}

{"label": 8, "raw": "Got these for work (Work as a Paramedic), so these do its job by being somewhat water-proof, good fit, and durable. They come super starchy, the size runs pretty small. (I'm a 34 in most everything, a 34 in this seems to feel like a 32 or even 30 at times). Depending on what you want of a work pant, this gets the job done, but just not that great of quality and will probably be thrown away after some use in a year or so."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband looks so cute in these. I bought them for him for work. He's constantly ripping holes in his front pockets from pulling tools and pens in and out, but so far, hasn't had any problems with these. The flat-front is very attractive. As some other reviewers mentioned, the waist fits snugly. I took a chance and purchased my husband's usual size, and he actually likes the way they fit. It took him a few wears to break these pants in, but he's very happy with them. I expect that they'll outlast the brands he usually purchases."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Be sure to go up in size. Anyone who wears Dickies apparently knows this. I looked at my man's pants to order him new ones, and there was no size that I could find on the old ones. So I ordered his normal pants size. Way too small. So I sent it  back and went up 2 sizes, and that was too big. Should have ordered one size up. Know your Dickies size and write it down!The fabric is stiff and sturdy, almost indestructible, does not lose its color in the wash."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My son wanted a Dickies work pants for work, something comfortable, of good quality and could handle the wear and tear required of his daily tasks.

When I purchased this Dickies Men's Original work pants for him I did not know what to expect, since I was ordering a different style from a previous choice in my order.  The package arrived quickly, quality excellent, and the pants is comfortable, allows you to move freely in the pants and are true to size. The Seller has provided accurate advertising in the description of these pants.  The packaging was excellent.  I would recommend this style of Dickies Men's Original 874 work pants to anyone seeking pants that can withstand durability, has quality, is reasonably priced, and you have choices of various colors to choose from, and are true to size and advertisement of the product."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have to wear black or khaki pants to work, and being a cat owner I can't really go with black. Despite the dress code I handle some pretty gross stuff, and I've ruined almost every pair of khakis I own. These work pants are the answer. They look just like &#34;real&#34; dress pants, but they're heavy material and they've got some sort of anti-liquid/anti-stain treatment on them. Water just beads off, solid stuff just wipes off or washes out without staining.My only gripes, and both minor:1: The fly isn't a button, it's a sort of tab/loop thing. Sometimes it comes unhooked. I always wear a belt anyway, so this isn't a huge problem.2: The side pockets could be a lot deeper. There is a shower of change whenever I sit down, but so far I haven't managed to lose my car keys.I think I'm going to end up buying a ton of these."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Great pants. Perfect fit.Wrinkle freeStain resistant. What more could you want?I don't know how other people are getting too big or small pants. I have ordered Silver, Khaki, and Black. They are a perfect fit. I always order a size bigger just in case they shrink after washing. I will update if any changes after washing. I would give this a 5 star but I don't like the clasp closure, I'd rather have a button. But Dickies does not have 34x29L pants with a button closure.Thank you amazon."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was asked to get some fishnets.  Im a lil above average...5'8, 190 pounds with NOT toned legs lol.  Anyhow, I figured plus size would work.  They did.  They tops do not roll down, or squeeze the fat up over them.  I wore them with garters and a garter belt.  The only thing I don't like is that they are the loose knit, not stretchy kind...so I can see them losing shape if you don't tend to them by handwashing periodically."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very comfortable as a nursing bra. I dont sleep in mine, but it was important for me to have a supportive bra that was not too tight and did not have underwires that would effect my milk supply. Based on the size of my breasts throughout the day, I can hook or unhook as many eyelets as i need to to be comfortable. I like that it is front hooking so that I can easily access my breasts to feed my son. The only drawback is that the seam comes up a bit high and can be uncomfortable on my nipples sometimes when they are sensitive after nursing. But for the price you cannot beat the comfort and function of this bra. i wish there was a hyrid version of this and the Simple Wishes Hands free pumping bra."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been looking for something comfortable to wear around the house and I've found it. I just had a baby a few months ago and I'm huge (42C). This fits perfectly. It's not too tight and not too lose and it provides some support. Not as much as my underwire, but around the house, it's great. I forget I have it on and the hooks in the front don't bother at all.It also keeps you separated... no uni-boob, which is awesome.All in all a good investment."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this primarily to wear when I'm kinda dressed, but not leaving the house; it's so comfortable that I've slept in it, and woken up none the worse for wear. I'm a 38D, and I can't say this offers the kind of support I prefer for outside wear. However, it looks very nice, and gives very good support and excellent separation; it's perfect for wearing when I can't be bothered with an underwire. I also love the front closure. It's really easy to close and doesn't chafe at all while I'm wearing the bra.In short, this is the first \"leisure bra\" I've ever worn that doesn't leave me with a single sagging mono-bazoom. It's not cheap, but I'm going to get another one, because this ratio of comfort to support is hard to come by."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Got it for those &#34;hang around the house in a sweatshirt&#34; days.  For the most part it's quite comfortable.  The band is a little snug-feeling by the end of the day - but that's why I opted for a front closure (and can reasonably unhook the bottom 1 or 2 hooks).Hopefully some ladies agree with me:  the bra I put on in the morning (comfy) is not the one I take off at night (band is too snug).  This bra is as close as it comes to being the best answer to that problem.  I look the array of colors it came in too."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Absolutely gorgeous! A perfect replacement for those nylon and spandex, unlined bras Calvin Klein used to make, that made the breasts look completely natural and not \"packaged\" like they do with \"contour cups.\" Unfortunately, the band and cups do run small. A 38DD fit like a 36C. In fact, this is the second Wacoal Bra I've tried that ran small (see my review ofWacoal Women's Halo Lace Full Coverage Underwire Bra # 65547). I'd buy three if the size went up to 40D!! But alas, 99.9% of racerback and racerback-like (close-set straps) bras stop at 38D or DD. If you're a smaller chested woman, this bra is THE CURE to all those ridiculous euphemisms for padded bras: \"molded cups,\" \"T-shirt bra,\" age-defying lift\" and my favorite, \"seamless.\" Thank you very much, but simple nylon over my own breast is actually seamless!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The first thing you notice about this bra in Toast color is that it looks as a posture correcting device in terms of color, fabric texture, overall design and ugly straps in the back, in particular. So, in short, the look is bad, you cannot undress without scaring your man. Perhaps, in black this bra would look better, but far from being attractive anyway. The cups are very thin, as other reviewers already noticed, but for me it was not a problem. Hence, I give it 2 stars for holding the straps at the center as a T-back supposed. The bust support is OK for one day until fabric stretches. Wonder why it is so expensive if it is neither good sport or comfort bra, nor a sexy dress style."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a wonderful style bra. I have worn them for years and they do eventually wear out and I order another drawerful.I even sleep in one. They 're that comfortable. I have a size 32 frame but need the D cup ( and this is a very difficult size to locate. I can rarely find them in stores any more.)  So Amazon saves the day for me again! It is so supportive that you could wear it any time from dressing up or to wear under your gym outfits. However, if I was going to be running, a compression bra might be a better choice...I started wearing this style front hook when I had had a hand surgery and couldn't use a back hook ...and never went back to it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I originally bought one of these bras in a department store when they didn't have any nursing bras my size, and I purchased an additional one from Amazon later.  The salesperson said she wore this bra all the time while her baby was breastfeeding!  The salesperson helped me find the correct size so that the underwires do not pinch my breast tissue, which can lead to clogged ducts.  I actually only pump since my baby never learned to breastfeed, but it's very easy to unsnap the front to pump.  The stretchy cups accomodate size changes throughout the day from breastfeeding, and the underwires make it so much more flattering than the wire free bras I've tried.  My only complaint is that the cups are very thin, so I need to wear nursing pads to prevent \"headlights\" -- for this reason, I will not wear these bras once I'm done breastfeeding and will go back to a padded or molded cup style."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra looks very nice; I got both the black and the toast. Issue here is I wonder how long they will hold up. They have a type of 't-shirt material' feel; and aren't the sturdiest. For the price, I was expecting much higher quality. Time will tell if they hold up or fall apart! Not impressed with the quality but they are comfortable. Not sure if I recommend; due to my conflicting thoughts on them. I do think you can get a better quality bra for a lower price here on Amazon..."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been buying this bra for many years,  however it was about 4  years ago when I bought the last one.  This new one just doesn't seem like the same quality that it used to be.  I ordered two Wacoal bras,  they are both made in two different places.  This one is made in Dominican Republic,  the other one in China.  The one from China seems like the old  Wacoal quality and worth the money.  This one does not,  and it certainly in my opinion isn't worth what it cost.  The cup fabric looks as if it would wear out quickly to me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "It took awhile and some deep breathing to finally spring for the WACOAL brand that I'd heard so much about (we've even had conversations about these bras at work), but I needed a T-back bra and decided to go for it, expensive tag and all.  And I have to say it IS the most comfortable and form-flattering bra that I own.  It easily compares to the pricey Victoria's Secret bras that I have splurged on in the past and is pretty if not uber-sexy...seems made more for function than fun...and in that it definitely excels. Not sure why it is that I feel I have to justify paying for comfort and performance in lingerie, I certainly pay for and expect it sportswear, shoes, jeans, etc.  Maybe because its underneath and not seen? Anyway, this is now my go-to bra for comfort and looks, and I won't hesitate (well, maybe one deep breath) to buy another WACOAL bra."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this one bra on a trial basis. I was worried since many people said it was so thin you would need to have a cover for nipple area. Well, yes if you are wearing a thin shirt this might be an issue. But the fit and comfort FAR outweigh that issue for me. I bought one in white and black I love them so much. Worth every penny and then some. The fit is perfect, the support is great, the fact my shoulders are not being dug into as this doesn't sit there---I love that. I wear a 36C so not like I'm huge and need alot of support. Just enough to help keep the girls in their place. This bra does exactly that."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The more I wear it, the more I love it.  It's so comfortable.  I'm not constantly messing with the straps and tugging on it because I'm about to fall out of it.  This bra fits really well.  The minute I put it on, I can stop thinking about it for the rest of the day.  The straps stay put and don't dig in to my shoulders.  Plus, I love not having to worry about the straps showing.  Fits true to size and fits well.  Good support.  Have all three colors now.  :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I really, really wanted to love this bra. It shipped quickly and when I opened it up the product seemed to be of the usual high quality that comes with a Wacoal bra. But when I went to try it on it was far too small for me. I usually wear a 38DD and that is what I ordered. I have many other Wacoal bras and I always wear a 38DD no exceptions. But this fit like a 34DD. The cup size was fine but the band was far too small. I sadly went out of town and missed the opportunity to return it so I'll hope that I lose a bit of weight and it will one day fit because it seems like a really good bra, just make sure you order up a size or two."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So many guys wear panty's and not even their wives know. My wife started me in panty's years ago and this is all I wear. These are by far the most comfortable panty's you can buy and I have a lot of different ones myself. I have no problem changing In dressing rooms at the pool or gym wearing these panty's. I don't hide that I wear panty's. I have even changed in locker rooms wearing lace and even ruffles. Guys if your sick of cotton like I was these are the ones to try. Everything about this panty is great and before long you will be in panty's forever."}

I have a 48\" waist and I normally wear a size 9/XL panty, but I wear these in size 7 and they fit quite comfortably and still have some give to them! They don't pinch, bind or ride up. There is plenty of room up front for the male anatomy. I recommend that you hand wash and hang-dry these, they will last longer. If Jockey made these for men, then us men wouldn't have to wear panties!"}

Love the feel on my skin. i have a 36 waist usually take a 6 in most panties and these were very nice. My my most recent purchases however, have been size 5 and with the stretch of this of this panty i'll only buy a 5 in the future. Now have every color. These are simply awesome to wear! i wear panties 24/7 now and love it. These are my favorites withou a doubt. men, do your selves a favor and check them out."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Love love love these underwear for years now.  I've rarely had a problem with underwear riding up my bum with these, which is the main reason I buy these.  I'm a full figured woman, but also wore these when I was more athletic and they're wonderful.  Wearing them to work as a professional to the gym, they fit great.  They last for years too which is amazing.  I finally replaced some after going through a pregnancy and stretching some out.  My main helpful hint is to wash them in a bag or by themselves to avoid balling up from other clothes."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this bra because it had so many good reviews and I am always looking for a minimizer bra.  I bought my regular size which is a 34C.  I have to wear it in the loosest hook and I usually wear a 34C in the tightest hook.  I put it on this morning and it felt a little snug but not uncomfortable and I thought it would be OK.  Now it's after lunch and I am sitting at my desk after eating a Chick-Fil-A sandwich -- just the sandwich mind you -- not the meal.  Well I am about to die. This bra is cutting me in half and there's nothing I can do about it.  I can't just take it off and go around braless so I am hostage to this torture chamber!  I'm too lazy to send it back so I'll just wear it on a &#34;thin&#34; day."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this bra over two years ago on a whim from a different website, and I almost wore it out to the point where the hooks on the back started coming apart. Its lacy so I wasn't expecting much comfort, but I literally wore it day and night PLUS my girls arent as &#34;perky&#34; as they were after my first baby so they give excellent support, are true to size, and comfortable enough. They also dont show through any cute shirt you might want to wear."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Bought this on a whim, and I absolutely love it!  For larger sizes, it's not super supportive, but still gets the job done.  Really attractive but somehow still kind of modest.  No lines or pointy boobs!Pros:- Sizing seems accurate (I wear 40D in Victorias Secret, same here)- full coverage without lines or pointy boobs- kind of sexy but kind of modest at the same time- washes well - no color run- thinner, but the lace is thick enough to prevent any major nip issues (still wouldn't wear with super thin tops though)Cons- very light support for the larger sizes ( I'd widen the strap!)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've tried other panties and brands of panties and must stick with what works.  I'm VERY pleased with the black pair of the Vanity Fair Women's Perfectly Yours Ravissant Tailored Nylon Brief in black, in fact, so much so that I ordered three pairs in blushing pink (I think they will look just fine under white slacks in summer).  However, my first order was canceled after more than 11 days when they had not yet shipped from a department store in Florida!  I canceled and went back to check and they were then available directly from Amazon and came in two business days."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Tried these on over my panties, and it was a perfect fit.  Ran them through the wash, and they came out AT LEAST a full size smaller.  The shrinkage of the fabric was so bad that the elastic is actually bunched up now at the openings.  The leg openings are tight now, the height of the panty from crotch to belly is so much shorter, the rear area isn't fully covered. I can't wear them, and i can't send them back now.  Vanity Fair is disappointing me after many years of satisfaction.I can't say these are even worth trying.  Keep looking."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I recently purchased these panties based on the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality, price and fit. Being a male I was looking for a panty that appeared more to be a unisex style. The panties fit very well and are so much more comfortable than my old male underwear with the fly. The cotton in these panties is softer and more condensed. I have now thrown most of my old underwear out and will continue buying these panties as replacements. The wide gusset and the elastic leg bands make for a perfect fit for a male. I would highly recommend these panties to anyone, male or female."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm 44DD so I wear bras all the time.  This one is effective,  in that it lifts, and it gives good posture because if you slouch the wires stick out in the front - very unattractive,  so I find myself sitting straight.  It's comfortable but seriously not sexy, and comes up very high. It wears comfortably under my gym gear and I bought it for a gym bra but it's not very versatile,  as it shows under most of my other tops (and they're not particularly low cut)Edited to add,  it wasn't flexible enough to be comfortable in exercise class and I've just thrown it out.  Didn't work at all for me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Wow, I'm pretty shocked as to how many positive reviews this bra has.  The cup is shaped very weird, When on, it makes my boobs look like torpedoes!  And it pushes them wayyy to far apart.  They stick out too much on the sides and just makes the shape of my chest look un-natural.  No bueno.  I see other reviewers have had the same experience as me with this bra.  I sent it back immediately!The Bali #3372 is the one that makes my boobs look great and feel great, even though it's itchy sometimes.  This one looked almost the same, so I gave it a try.  But the way it looks on is very different from the way it looks off."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a girdle every day - it holds in my tummy but gives me man boobs. I wear a bra forsupport and to shape my breasts. The Bali 3820 double support is wonderful. I wear a 40 Bcup and fill the cups fully - no padding, no pushup and no falsies. My bra makes me standtaller and I am not at all self consciou. With gridle and bra on I look and feel greatin my clothes - women's underwear does just provide the support I need and the shaping Iwant. Would not leave home without my foundations - also - do wear stockings to hold myOBG down (black) and panties (pink)to make it easy to pull on."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The bra is well made and probably would last a long time, but the sizing on it seems off from other Bali bras.  I have been wearing Bali bras for quite a few years and love them, but they have discontinued the one that I have been wearing and I have been looking for something similar, thought this might be it, but it's not. This bra would probably work better for a larger breasted woman, has wider straps both for shoulder and the back and the cups seems cut for larger breasts.

{"label": 8, "raw": "Wacoal doesn't make the style I've been wearing anymore but this new style is a good substitute. It fits well, is true to size and quite comfortable...for a bra, that is. I like this style as well as the old style. Kinda nice to have a change. This is a good everyday bra...should last a long time. Wacoal makes good quality, good fitting bras that wear well. A bit pricey but worth it. I got the white but would like to get the other colors when they become available."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have these in nude and black.The nudes have lasted much longer than your standard grocery store hose, which is nice and expected for $8 hose.  I've worn them three or four times and they're still fine.The black I'm wearing now - put on for the first time and I already had to use nail polish to stop little tiny holes from growing. (My nails were filed and I wear hose all the time so I know how to put them on carefully.) It could be that these holes are just  more noticible with black.I love that these do not have the rubber elastic in them, which is hard to find and why I purchased them.However, the band is two times as long as it needs to be. Even with my garters cinched up all the way, I struggle all day making sure that the band doesn't peek out from my knee length skirt when I sit down.  That's particularly awkward for job interviews and such."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've worn these three times (!) since buying - my pantyhose NEVER last three wears!  High quality product.  May run a tiny big big, though these days I appreciate the comfort.  The belly panel is lace, which could be itchy for some, though usually I'm sensitive to that sort of thing and have had no trouble with it.  BTW, maternity pantyhose are a must (as opposed to non-maternity) - avoids the weird line and are a lot more comfortable.The seller is fantastic, there was a mixup about colors and they sent me a replacement free of charge.I recommend these (style 5700) for nude pantyhose, and the opaque version for colors."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose and thigh highs, I have been wearing them for about 15 years.  They look and feel good on my legs and under my clothes.  They are very sheer and sexy.  I can wear them all day and they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles.  They are also very durable, I usually get 5 or more wearings out of every pair.I used my Amazon Prime membership for the shipping and received free 2 day shipping.  The packages arrived on time and in good shape."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "my non control top pantyhose with sheer toe nylons are very sheer and pretty pantyhose, im an older woman who wears pantyhose and nylons everyday, non control top pantyhose are the same as sheer to waist pantyhose, so if i want a sheer pantyhose look on my legs my non control top pantyhose are wonderful. i wear these pantyhose in the sheer toes as well. i think i have these nylon pantyhose in the reinforced toe pantyhose too. i usually wear no nonsense pantyhose and nylons but i like hanes pantyhose also, i own several pairs of these pantyhose, they seem to last as long as my other pantyhose."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm pale skinned with pink undertones. I ordered \"barely there\", (the title next to a light shade of hosiery) and if by \"barely there\" they mean \"VERY OBVIOUSLY there\", then they've really nailed it with their subtley sarcastic description.These hose were brown, like a dark taupe. The photo clearly shows a lighter shade. So, anyway, the point of this review is, if your skin tone is like mine, don't make the same mistake I did by assuming the shades shown represented how these hose *actually* look in real life."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have very swollen lower legs and feet when I sit a lot, fly, or stand a lot.  I have a lot of compression knee hi socks and a pair of thigh highs. They worked pretty well in reducing the swelling, but never all the way, plus the elastic would dig into my leg at the base of my knee and leave a big groove.  My toes got pulled tight too.  Then, I found these socks.This brand and style and compression level are perfect in every way.  They don't dig into your leg at the top, they don't pull on your toes, they are very comfortable, look sporty, and they keep all of the swelling in my legs away.  I have 3 pairs now but I plan to get a few more.  So glad I stumbled upon this brand and style."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The Good:  I love these socks.  They are very well built and I feel like I have a sock that will last for years.  They are great for walking around the house with no shoes.  Their elastic around the calf is well made and I have yet to have a pair start to get loose on me.  The warmth is fantastic and they feel comfortable with all types of shoes.The Bad:  They are thick, but this is probably why you bought them anyway.  Just be aware that you may have tight shoes start to fit strangely because of that thickness."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased these for hiking primarily, but after wearing them for a day I wish I had a pair for every day of the week. They are extremely comfortable. I have sweaty feet and these certainly help wick the sweat away from my skin. Now the the weather is a bit cooler these are my go to socks. It's been about 2 months now and I wear these at least once a week, and they still look like new. Build quality seems to be very high and the padding is still think and comfy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I used these for hiking and I didn't want anything too heavy or bulky so these were just what I wanted.  I wear a lighter pair of wicking socks under these.  They fit nicely, had plenty of stretch and were nice and soft.  They dried quickly when I removed my hiking boots.  I am very please with this purchase.  I keep an extra pair in my pack if needed.  I hiked 10 miles up and down Mt. Katahdin with no blisters or anything so I have to say these socks did the trick to the max.Tom"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been trying to find a pair of trail running socks, but most everything I've seen or tested is at both ends of the spectrum - either too thick and tall, or too thin and short. Although they are called Hiking/Outdoor Socks, I would not consider them trail running. They are very comfortable due to thickness, but that's not what I want in a trail sock. Still, I can't fault them for hiking because they are quality made and feel good in hiking shoes/boots."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Fits like Levis but in a silver color that, while not seriously formal, is a step away from the totally casual blue. Note that fabric is not as thick as usual Jeans, though more than durable enough. Softer feel when wearing too - not as stiff. Will be cooler to wear when temps are high. Downside is that coloring is not uniform - thin streaks of light and dark. just don't expect a uniform solid gray. Straight leg style now changed to &#34;regular&#34;. Go figure. Still, the style is slimmer in the legs than the old &#34;regular&#34;. Not too slim though. Lots of length & waist options, which is not true for many Levis. Have purchased several pair. The black color Levis are much hotter to wear and fade poorly with wear. The &#34;silver&#34; doesn't do that."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Easy way to find jeans to fit my husband, order online...its so frustrating going to Kohls and hope they have his size in stock, he is a lil shorter and slimmer than the average, so this way I type the brand in the size and poof..done!Guy pants seem much easier to buy online cause they have exact measurements of waist and inseam to go buy,  women clothes can be hit and miss when ordering our typical size.These fit him perfectly and the color pretty much matches what it looked like online, I got him both the light and medium stonewash. They look and feel just like his other Levi's he got before  at the store...so ya this is where he is going to get all his pants from now."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've always worn Levi's jeans. Recently, however, they don't seem to last like they used to. Jeans that I have bought within the last 5 years or so, seem to wear out faster than older pairs I've had. Particularly around the pockets and the seam in the crotch. The material seems thinner too. While this makes them a tiny bit more comfortable, they don't make 'em like they used to. Still kinda expensive too, but they go on sale every once in a while. Or I can use points to buy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these thinking 'What a nice color'. Little did I realise that the dye used for this color has a really unpleasant smell. I washed them repeatedly in my very efficient and eco-friendly Asko washer, but the smell remained. If the jeans were mixed with other laundry, the odor would contaminate the other clothes. So, they were returned to Amazon. Thankfully, they accepted them.(This, in many years of online purchase, has been my only return).I wish I could say something better, but the truth must be told."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I grew up wearing Levi jeans, and these new Levis are not what they used to be, that's for sure. Levis cut their jeans in a way that fit me better than most other jeans I've tried, but the denim Levi is using these days just does not measure-up to their competitors denim what so ever. I got these 505 jeans in the rigid un-washed denim, so it's the heaviest denim Levi uses, but they still feel like weak pants with all the fabric-body of a worn-out bed sheet. I used to love my Levis, but now I hate where I see the quality of their products are heading."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The Seller is terrific ordered and it shipped and received in BETTER than a timely fashion!! Now.the jeans although feel and fit very nice,still do not feel like they use to back in the good ole days of 505 and 501 Levis!! This does not mean that I do not like the feel and comfort,they do feel very good and fit very nicely , I certainly will purchase another couple of pairs of these in the future especially from this seller!! But I would have given out a 5th star if I found that the quality of the jeans were they way I remember them from the 70's and 80's!! Those felt like,you know ,the way cars were built back in the 50's and 60's firm/strong/ built to last??? But this is the world today! Recommended and buy from this seller;they are GREAT!! Thanks"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Pretty nice jeans. They are very dark and the color does run when they are washed. They definably fit larger than the 505's in &#34;Range&#34; that I bought in the same size. These sit at the waste not below. I soaked them when I first got them and have washed and dried them a few times and they shrank some but are still bigger than the 505's in &#34;Range&#34;.Bottom line is these are Levi's and they are notoriously inconsistent. You can find them almost anywhere. I would just buy in store so you know they will fit ok."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline, an endless abyss. The back label, which supposedly should be leather, now seems to be made &#8203;&#8203;of cardboard and a lousy finish. The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least, in my experience, has been. I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world. Previously, a Levis jeans was a piece \"almost perfect\", today I can not say the same. I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these Levis because I haved owned many pairs in the past and they have always been good quality jeans I could trust. Levis was recently bought and since has tried to change their look to appeal to the younger crowd. They messed with just about every type of jeans except the 501 but that has button fly and I prefer a zipper fly. The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I can't stand it. My old 505s did not do this. The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them. They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle. These are horrible jeans in terms of fit and quality, look elsewhere until this company learns it lesson not to mess with a good thing."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was glad to find these jeans in a size 35 waist, since I had only seen Levi's in even-sized waist only. The color is a great stonewash hue, ideal for me. Two important differences compared to the 501's: ONE, the 505 has a zipper instead of metal buttons on the fly (a well-known feature); TWO, less known is that the rise in the 505's is lower than the 501's. The difference in the rise, in my pants is a 1 1/2\" lower rise in the 505's, something I am not used to."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've always wanted to buy several Levi's and be brand loyal but over the years the sizing across several styles and denim is simply all over the place. Seat is usually way too tight or too baggy (as is the fit),  inseam is always way too long. Had hopes with this style but again, disappointed. Certainly not a brand for those looking to avoid way too skinny or way too baggy jeans. Simple straight legged pants that fit as sized on the labeling are extremely hard to come by these days. Levi's sizing is so erratic you basically need to try on a dozen pairs across a dozen styles to get remotely close to what might adequately fit. Shouldn't be this hard to buy Levi's."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have to agree with some of the other reviewer comments regarding the decline in quality for Levi jeans.  The material seems a lot thinner than the last pair of jeans I purchased.  Besides the flimsy material the jeans didn't fit well either.  I have worn the same size jeans for the past several years.  I would swear the pair I just purchased on Amazon was at least a size too big. I ended up buying the size pair of Lee jeans on Amazon and they fit just right and the quality of material was a lot better.  Lee jeans has a new customer."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is my last time of buying Levis.  Order this model and 2 others at the same time during an Amazon sale. Been wearing the same and models for decades.  The quality and fit of the fabric just isn't there anymore.  One pair got a hole in the upper thigh after the first washing.  All the jeans I bought this time, stretch out within hours of wearing.  I have a 31 inch waist, and if I do not have a belt on these jeans are sliding way down within an hour.  This is after washing and drying 5 times.  Ended up going to Marshall's and getting much higher quality jean for half the price.  Sad  to see a company like Levi let themselves forget about their customers. They are so focused on producing at the loweest price, that they no longer seem interested in producting a quality product.  Too bad"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered these Levis thinking I may have lost a little weight so I would get them a size smaller than usual.  I think manufactureres are lieing to us to make us feel good.  These jeans were a good deal too large even though ordered a smaler size.  I have a pair of Levis that I have had for a long time in the same size as these and they are really snug on me. I still love Levis and won't change to another brand I would like to warn buyers that a size 36 waist is mor like a 38.  They are still high quality though and I guess I can now say a 36 waist is too big on me and my diet was a great success.One important thing - The price was really good and I will buy more in a smaller size - Man my diet is easy!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn Levi's 505s since high school until now and probably will into retirement. The quality is better than jeans costing more and superior and heavier than those costing less. You can frequently find them discounted. I cannot recall ever wearing a pair out. I have retired or given them away when I gained or lost weight. I dropped 2 inches recently in my waist and had to buy several pairs. I am keeping the old bigger ones just in case, but I hope I keep my narrower waist. I have tried other Levi's but 505s fit me best. The others are way too tight or way too big. I am 6 ft 3 and weigh about 200 pounds. The 36 34s fit me perfectly."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This one actually keeps the girls in a more upright position - and that's a big deal for a middle aged woman, believe me. I didn't want a molded, balconette type - puleeze! But nothing else seemed to give any uplift. The straps stay put which is usually a problem for me, too, plus the straps are comfortable. The side elastic stretches and gives nicely without being too loose. I really love this thing and I have a drawer full of others I won't bother to wear. I'm a 42C and it was true- to -size for me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn this bra for many years.  Had trouble finding it and then... of course... found it here on Amazon. (LOVE Amazon)The cups are now almost 'bullet shaped'.  I feel like I should be back in the 50's or in a Madonna video.  It is very strange.  Nothing like before.  That being said... it is still very comfortable and they did eliminate the tag by stamping the label inside the back strap... which I like.  But the cup shape is so strange that I will not buy again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I don't even want to take this bra off,  it's that comfortable.  I especially enjoy the wide straps.  I'm starting to get indentations on my shoulders from straps digging in through the years!Not with these straps.  Support is outstanding and looks great under clothes.  Don't suffer with cheaper bras that are not comfortable!The quality of Wacoal bras is outstanding and although they are spendy will outlast most other brands.  However  beware,  as I have bought knockoffs calling themselves Wacoal which indeed were not.(Ebay)  I can tell the difference right off the bat!  Hopefully that is not happening here on Amazon as one reviewer complained.  I can certainly vouch that this is a Wacoal bra.  I have bought several of these through the past 15 years."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "that is what it feels like when you put on a new Wacoal bra.  I particularly like this style 85185 because it has 4 hooks. It is not sold as a minimizer but because it is so well built and so innovative it works well to put everything in the places it all used to be in when I was 15.  I have had my Wacoal bras for as long as 4 years and I still have to buy a new one to let me know the others have finally worn out...they never look stretched or worn.  I hope they never take this bra off the market."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just recently received my waist cincher (medium) it's the first corset-like product that I will be using after gaining some weight and being limited as to what I can do as far as Exercise goes which is almost non-existent. This garment is made with great quality. I hear the customer service is Excellent which is very important and most people say these undergarments are Better than Spanx! Also some people said not to go by the chart well I looked at it and was between numbers so I went with the higher NO. I don't know if I should have done that or not so I have a Black Medium. From what I can tell it holds you in well and I really like it a lot, I now know where to go for these type of products and Highly Recommend!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This waist cincher is perfect for those who don't have a whole lot to pack in, but want a smooth, long line.  I also like it because the garter straps can be significantly shortened, so the tops of my stockings are not down near my knees at the end of the day.  It is comfortable but sturdy - no weird poking or pinching - and it holds its shape throughout the day.  Finally, this is much more visually appealing than most waist cinchers/tummy flatteners out there.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "As another reviewer mentioned, it's hard to find an XS girdle/shaper and this one certainly does the job of taking away a couple inches off my waist to look great in wedding dress. However all of the cinching is at the waist and perhaps not enough in the hip area which gives you an almost unnatural silhouette: tiny waist, big hips, flattened top of butt - my torso and hips feel a bit like 2 sausage links separated at the waist but on the good side it gives you a very 50s  bombshell figure under the RIGHT type of clothes. I don't recommend wearing it under fitted or slinky clothing, for me that looks a little bizarre and you can clearly see the hooks. But it is perfect under layered clothing, much like a wedding dress!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this several years ago and am now ordering a second one. It really works well. Just so you know at first you will think it is too small but once you hook it up it fits snug but comfy. Start from the top when hooking together. It makes my waist look tiny and smooths my little muffin top, helps make tummy look flatter. I have bought several different kinds but this one is the only one I continue to use. Well worth the $30 I spent. I have it in black, in extra small. I am 5'2, 120, I use to be 100-110, but this still fits good. I call it my winter weight lol."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This cincher is as firm as they get and chisels out a fantastic waist. If you're looking for a great silhouette under fitted clothes that aren't too clingy, this is your secret weapon. It's my go-to shapewear when wearing jeans and a button-front sweater, or with dresses that nip in at the waist (the garters are very sturdy) but don't cling to the body. Button-front sweaters hide the hooks in front of the cincher--which will otherwise show through clothes--and if you're a bit \"fluffy\" in back this might not be the best choice for you under fabrics that closely show the shape of your back (it might blend with the line of your bra... it might not). Overall it's a solid and well-used part of my shapewear wardrobe. Note: Rago has a line of products that are not always identified clearly in Amazon; check out [...] for details."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I hate bounce. I'm a 36DD, and like high impact sports. While this bra didn't completely eliminate bounce, it certainly reduced it to a more comfortable level. I can do intervals in this, play basketball, and jump around to my hearts content. I still sometimes do the double bra technique with this bra, but this is probably the only bra I'd wear on its own for high impact sports.Upside: best bra around for minimizing bounceDownside: Ugly. No getting around that. You can't wear cute little tops with this. But when you don't have painful bounce, you can live with a little more coverage."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Function is more important that looks or cush for large women who run.  And this is the only running bra that works.  It has the least  bounce of any running bra, regardless of price.  Enell figured out that ANY elastic promotes bounce.UUUUGLY!  Squished cleavage pokes out of the top of a size 3 (but the size 4 isn't tight enough for 40DD). Huge seams show under your tank top.  Uglier than dirt. So what?  This uni-boob from hell prevents the pain and the DOWN-side of gravity--for your future figure.Okay, Enell:  you can improve it with a wider placket shield, since the hooks can touch and irritate skin.  And maybe one day you can cush it up a bit...In the mean time, strap them girls down and hit the trail."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am a big fan of Fantasie bras, and this one is exceptionally pretty, well-made AND supportive.  It's also very sexy and with the matching panties, just the sort of lingerie I hope to be wearing should I end up in an ambulance or the hospital (I've been told they really DO check out the underwear by two reliable sources.)  If you're larger busted and not typically a fan of the balcony style, take a chance on this bra and I have a feeling you'll be happy with your purchase."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "gloves very comfortable and kept my hands warm for the most part.  The day I used them was the coldest day of the year and it was an early morning run and my fingers at the end were so cold my fingers felt like they could fall off.  I saw them in a running store and mentioned this, the guys in the shop said it must be because my hands didn't sweat.  Apparently they are really good gloves.  I will use them again but the next cold run will have another pair of warm gloves on top."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra fits well and the demi look is sexy.  Nice to have a sexy bra in my size, 34D.  The fit is on the small size.  This is a good choice for those of us with short torsos.  The side wings don't cut into me like on a lot of bras and as others have said the straps are very adjustable.What I don't like about the bra is that the underwire is scratchy, and the cup tops are visible under t-shirts.  Maidenform demi cups show under t-shirts on me, I'm not sure why.  I do have one Wacoal demi that is completely invisible, so I know it's possible to create an invisible demi."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Maidenform's bra was labeled the correct size, but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length, and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit.  They said over the phone they could do an exchange, then when we paid $10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges.  They have no consistency in their bra sizes, and they have terrible customer service support."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I found this bra on sale for $7 at TJMaxx a while back and I didn't think I'd like it, but it was such a good deal I thought I'd give it a shot. I ended up loving it! I got it in the black and beige striped print and it's gorgeous! I have gotten so many compliments on it from friends, women at the gym, and my boyfriend (I don't think I've ever gotten complimented on a regular, everyday bra before, only the special occasion stuff). It seems very true to size and is comfy. Unlike some demi bras, the cups are cut low enough that it doesn't show out of the top of scoopneck shirts or tank tops. Another think I love about it is that the strap adjustment ring is in the front, not in the back, so it's easy to adjust perfectly, with out having to call in a friend for help lol. Definitely recommended."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just a really comfortable bra and the color is great because it doesn't show through anything.I wash it in the washer in a lingerie bag and hang it to dry and it still has held its shape and size after months of wear.  The cups are still very smooth, no weird wrinkles or anything! Shoulder straps don't  fall off my tiny shoulders like a lot of bras do, which I realllly appreciate. And when I change the length part, it doesn't move from that spot while I'm wearing it.There's nothing particularly fancy about this bra, but when I wear this bra, I forget that I'm wearing it - it's that comfortable. Plus, I'm a 34a, so I appreciate the lift and padding help!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered 2 of these bras for my girlfriend, because she got too big for her previous bras, (that's a Great Problem to have. LOL!). I liked the way the looked in the pictures, and most of the ladies in the reviews absolutely raved about them; so I thought I would give them a try.First, the price was less than half of what I paid at the local Victoria Secret's. My girlfriend says since I so fond of her breast, I am responsible for keeping them looking good. (I have absolutely NO PROBLEM with that. LOL!)Long story short, they arrived very quickly, they fit her very very well, and they look GREAT!!!I definitely will be ordering more in many colors. WOOO HOOO!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots,I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others can't.Shopping local yields nothing like these,just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I've come to expect from Levi's,outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was  prompt,making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again,THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These T shirts are thin (which I personally like) and fit great. I love the colors too, the images here represent the real colors well.I got two of these, one last year one this year and they keep the color even washing repeatedly in hot water.I am 5.5 tall, I got an S and it was right in length but too large so I just washed it in hot water and dried it in the drier at max temperature (I got the 100% cotton one). This way it would get like a XS, which fits a normal size woman."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This really cinches the waist and gives you the hourglass in an instant. I have an hourglass shape myself, but still needed a cincher to hide the consequences of cookies and other crap called food (tummy and love-handles. I have a training corset, but the corset is too stiff to be able to bend in it (even to drive a car - makes me sit real high in my car as it also works your posture and makes you sit real straight and high, so I feel like I have a real gigantic torso, because normally I like to sit low or sit on my tailbone when I drive). Anyway, this cincher is the bomb. It is firm and shapes you into a real hourglass."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Received this item before expected.  Delivery was excellent.  I was afraid that the measurements would be incorrect on thewebsite but I chose a large and it fits perfectly.  It is a little hard to put on but once it is on it does exactly as stated.  There areno love handles on my side and it makes any garments have a perfect look and my waist looks much smaller.  If anyonewants to order this product please use your hip measurements and not your waist.  Buying this item in too large a size will not letyou get the effect desired."}

I haven't had any issue with ripping or snagging or being too loose. You don't have to use a garter, but I'd recommend it because while they do stay up long enough to make an impact, but they don't stay that way for long.And seriously, for the price, they are great. You can barely get a bottle of soda these days for this price. Even if they don't last a lifetime (I've only had mine a few weeks), I won't lose sleep if I need to replace them. As with any delicate item, launder these carefully--hand wash only, and don't scrub madly away as if you're ridding the world of germs.They shipped quickly and were packaged well. I have other items from this company and would order more in future."}

{"label": 8, "raw": "This is an update to my first review.  The band is showing signs of wear after only a few months.  I am disappointed, but still think it's a decent watch.Original review:  This is a lovely watch that weighs almost nothing and lies flat on the wrist.  I have some very exclusive and expensive watches - but I am wearing this one because it is so comfortable.  The only negative so far - it has come loose a few times.  I think I buckle it properly - maybe it catches on something.  The band has an amazingly silky feel.  Excellent value!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I loved this watch when I first recieved it but I have quite a collection and don't wear any one watch often. Bought this one in July 2012, it is now January 2013 and I've only worn it 3 times. On the 3rd wearing the band came loose from the face and at this point I can only get a partial refund. NOT COOL!! I have one other Skagen that I purchased at the same time (a browm dial) and now I'm almost afraid to wear that one. Like this one, it is thin and nice to look at. I will not even consider another Skagen in the future. Looks and feels like quality, but NOT!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've had this watch for awhile now and really like it. I think its pretty and goes well with all my bracelets, silver and gold. It runs well and unlike most other comments, i don't have a problem seeing the time. The only issue to aware of is.. if you don't clamp the latch properly, it will fall off after wearing it all day!  That has happened to me twice. Both times someone had picked it up off floor and gave it back..i didn't even know it was gone!  I got lucky. Otherwise, its great!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered the 32K, per size charts... I think the cups run smaller then the size chart states.The bra is made of a rough material, it rubbed my armpits and cleavage raw after only a few hours.The under-wires poked threw after the second wearing. I only hand washed it.The stitching and seems show threw even heavy tee-shirts...The stretchy straps are a bad idea for large breasts...Overall I am not impressed with the quality of this product. I would not recommend it to women with large breasts."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra offers excellent support for large busted women -- it's very sturdy.  I find that the cups are cut a little too high under the arms and impede arm movement and comfort, but I was told at my local bra boutique that cup sizes F (or maybe it was FF or G - can't remember, but that's the range) and up are cut that way to accommodate the volume of larger breasts so that there's no &#34;spill over&#34; at the underarm area.  Because it covers a lot of area, it's not good for wearing with low cup tops. Overall, this is a very good bra and it's pretty."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a 36 H now that I am nursing, and the medium ++ fits perfect. This is by far my most comfortable nursing bra. I wear it around the house, while sleeping, running errands, and even playing racquetball. The fit is like a sports bra (it does create a &#34;uniboob&#34; look) but it has great support.  If you are looking for a nursing bra for busty women with better shaping for going to work or dressing-up, I recommend the Bravado Bliss Nursing Bra, but definitely buy a Double Plus (or a few) for your days off."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered this bra per the product guidelines..I am very large busted, and I thought this would be a good nursing bra--for not having wires.The only thing this bra is good for is for holding nursing pads in overnight.  There's no support--none.  I can't even imagine it would support me if I was smaller, either.  The fabric is fairly decent, but I am surprised at the positive reviews from the larger busted lady reviews on here.  I recommend the Goddess bra, or glamourmom nursing tanks--this bra was seriously a joke!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very comfortable and easy to nurse with. Great support for hospital, around house day and night, not so much for work/going out bc much like a sports-bra in shape (or lack thereof).If this is your first pregnancy, and you'll be nursing, you'll need several nursing bras. Several, because baby daily with spit milk right back at you and you'll be sleeping in them too when your boobs weigh down with milk.  Frankly, it's uncomfortable not wearing a bra.In a nursing bra, one-handed latching/unlatching is important so you can hold baby with the other hand.  This bra has super easy latches.  It's excellent."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this nursing bra. It's super comfy and fairly supportive. But, it fits like a sports bra, giving you a &#34;uni-boob&#34;. Especially if you have a larger chest like me. However, it's perfect for wearing around the house! The one thing I don't like about this bra is the line on the side of your boob. It shows under clothes and can be annoying. As a side note, I wear a 42H while nursing and the Double Plus XL fits just fine. :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I never imagined myself getting a sports-style nursing bra as I have never found sports bras, on their own, to be particularly supportive for me.  Without any special gadgets I could spot, I didn't understand how such a style of nursing bra would do well for me.  However, this one had so many positive reviews and I had heard such good things about the company...This bra is far better than I expected.  Yes, it's a \"sports bra\" but I was amazed at just how supportive and shapely it is.  I am completely comfortable in this bra (thanks to the lack of underwire as well as the incredible support), whether it be day or night.  The clasps are easy to work as well without too much fiddling."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra fits great, and is comfortable.  Not \"you won't know you're wearing it\" comfortable, but \"WOW, all this support and I feel fine comfortable.\"The girls get plenty of support, not just north and south, but east and west, too.  They haven't been where they are now for 20 years!  This bra isn't lacy or frou frou, but it is pretty, the the lining does NOT bunch up and have you walking around with the dreaded bosom pleat.  I've never before found a bra with this much support combined with comfort and lining (we're not supposed to have nipples, you know).  I bought it because of the reviews, and I thank the other reviewers because I need look no farther for the perfect bra!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm 49 and my body has recently changed so I've tried a few bras lately, and this one is the best. It lifts, covers my underarm-boob (as defined in Oprah mag), doesn't gap at all on my slightly smaller side, shows no seams, comes in skin-tone, is comfortable...I think that's my entire checklist. My second favorite was a Betsy Johnson demi-bra that was adorable but the seams show under t-shirts. I bought a few Calvin Kleins (before I discovered this Natori) that don't address \"underarm boob.\" Nothing else in my size (32D) made the cut. Hope this helps someone."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I understand that I wear a size 38DDD, but I still feel that even if I wore a smaller size, this bra would do nothing for me.  It is like a normal bra and will be used as such.  It gives less support than some normal bras that I have had for over a year, a medium amount of lift and if I wore this to run, I would probably get hit in the face with a boob.  No lie.  The fabric is thin and does not &#34;hold you in&#34; as a sports bra really needs to do to be effective.  Two stars because it does not do what it is intended to do.  If you are looking for a good sports bra, I would definitely not recommend this one.  If you want a &#34;lounging around the house, comfortable cleaning bra&#34; then yes, this would work for you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Got this bra in my regular size, (38DD) and I love it! I have VERY dense breast tissue and full breasts so I have a hard time finding sports bras that are supportive enough (I tried the donna karen full coverage underwire and the material was too thin to support my breasts) I love this bra, it comes up high, is super supportive and comfortable so when walking/running/exercises they dont giggle like usual! Next to try, the Wacoal Sport underwire bra, I hear that is fantastic as well!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My daughter lives in flip flops during the summer so I wanted to find a pair that was supportive.  Tried Chaco (too heavy) and a Reef Fanning (toe piece hurt) with no luck.  Grabbed my flip  flops that I bought several years ago at REI which were very supportive and comfortable (walked all around Disney last summer on a pouring rain day), and discovered they were Reef slaps.  Found the Slap 2 which has an identical style so I ordered them.  She loves them!  I would like another color but mine are still in great shape after several years' wear."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I live in flip flops, but my feet tend to hurt if I walk in them too much, for example in the mall.  However, this is not a problem with my Slap 2's.  Amazing cushiony comfort, it really does feel like walking on a cloud (as one reviewer said).I'm a 6.5 usually, so decided to go with the 6, and I'm glad that I did.  It fits nicely.  The sandal itself looks very durable. What I like most about this product is that my feet does not slide around in the sandal.  It's like it creates a nice little soft (but not too soft) pocket for my feet.  Excellent product!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn Reef's for many years. I have a very high arch and narrow foot so it can be a challenge to find a snug enough fit. These sandals envelope my foot and embed it far enough that it gives great support. The arch is superior to any Reef sandal I've tried. They are not too light and therefore are more durable. While I only wear these indoors as a house slipper, I am sure they would be comfortable walking over most road surfaces, including gravel.  I don't suggest that this sandal is only for narrow feet. Through repeated wearings they have grown much looser on my foot, but that is what I have grown to expect considering most sandals are made for and average size feet. I highly recommend these sandals."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love these for their support and comfort. I (sadly) just can't wear the tiny cutesy flip flops any more. But I don't care bcs I LOVE these. They do run small so order a size up. ln my opinion, this style has the best/cushy heal . Some others have a hard heal, which I do not recommend. My first pair has last 6 years and I wear them almost daily (I live in FL) and the tread on the bottom is still good but the front toe portion has separated. Worth the cost for sure."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So I got the leather one first, coz I like leather and I trust leather. But Unfortunately the straps were too tight. and the leather color was darker on pic which I liked but not in person (in my opinion).Figured it's too small so I got 1 size larger, but this time in non leather one, in black. It was too big in all areas, and made my feet feel too hot when walking outside it was unbearable, figured coz it's all pretty much black.So I finally got the white (aqua) one in my regular size...and it fits perfectly!! Wtf, right? Lol.stop thinking, stop complaining and just wear it. you will love it. loli am so picky and was thinking ah the fabric, ah, the length, the width, the height, blah blah blah...true to size. wear it and be happy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've previously had the Fannings and loved them. I thought since it was the same company that makes these they'd be very similar. I was very disappointed to learn that was not the case. These state they're medium and I've never had an issue with a 7M before, however, when I try to slide my foot in the back strap near the heel is too narrow and cuts into my arch. It's extremely uncomfortable and I had to return them due to the discomfort.I should have just stuck with what I'm used to. I knew the Fannings were comfortable and I these looked so similar I thought I'd give them a try. Even from looking at the photo of these the straps don't look like they're squeezing the foot but either I received an item that was put together wrong or the shoe is the photo is just better.I hate complaining and returning but I really had no choice on these. Looks like everyone else has had success."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these for my husband for a snorkeling trip. These are his favorite shoes. Even after walking in water, the feet immediately feel dry once out of the water. They never smell, which is different from other water sandals. The toes are secure, the bottoms heavy and well made, and the inner cord is easily adjusted to provide a good fit. Even after getting them dirty with mud, they wash off easily with water and look like new. He even wears them with socks now that the weather is colder. A very well-made shoe/sandal."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a size 10 1/2 in my running shoes (Go Fasters, USMC !), I ordered a size 10, and they fit perfect and are true to size,I also have wide (see photo), These are my third pair of Keens and the last two were a 1/2 size too big.So  once they broke in,  walking to the mailbox and back they fit like a well worn glove, or sock. LOL !!  Brad B.  (Winston-Salem, N.C.)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Love Keens!  And this sandal is no exception.  Purchased these for my husband and the fit and style is great. They're comfortable and rugged.  I ordered the India Ink/Rust color combo because they were the cheapest, but was so pleasantly surprised.  They look much better in person than on the website!!!  If I were looking at them in a store and had choices for the same price, I still would pick this color combo.  If you haven't worn Keens before, they're a must..."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "It's hard to order shoes online without trying them on.  I'm a consistent size 8, so it doesn't scare me too much.  The seller recommended going up a half a size from what you normally wear, so I did.  I must say that I'm glad I did!  These fit perfectly!  Not saying that an 8 would have been too small, but the 8.5 fits perfectly.  These are easy to get on, using the loop in the back, and &#34;lace&#34; up quickly and easily.  These are easily the most comfortable shoes out of the box that I've ever bought.  They are thickly padded, have toe-protection, and don't look as clunky as the pictures in person.  So far, highly recommended."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My wife bought a pair of these panties a few years ago just to try something new. She was so impressed at how comfortable they were that she asked me to try them on. I now own 24 pair of them! These are, without a doubt, the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn! They are stretchy, light, cool and they don't pinch, bind or ride up. I would suggest that you wash these on gentle cycle and hang dry them. They will last much longer!My only question is why doesn't Jockey make anything like this for their male customers? 0-0-0"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Jockey makes the best panties, especially the tactel line. Received my first pair of the hi cut and the first thing i did was try them on to see if the stretcth, smooth, soft feel was the same as the string bikini. Dead on with size and comfort. i'm 6 feet with a 36 waist and the size 5 is my favorite. Very sexy looking and the fabric holds me in better than any panty. The support is fantastic. The only thing i would change is lower the backside 1-2 inches. With the comfort and fit of this panty,a minor complaint. I'll be buying these in every color. Love them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "yeah, I gave my husband a man bag.  He only uses it when we travel (hides it in the car as he won't admit to needing one).  He does like it, great for the cell phone, car keys, wallet iPod etc that he needs to keep track of.  It has a military look which he preferred, but the canvas that the bag is made out of is very thin, I don't think it could take much abuse.  And that's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.  At least I no longer have to lug his stuff in my purse!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This item is made from a loosely woven fabric and does not in any way resemble the durable military messenger/map pouches.  The strap is narrow, which would cut into the shoulders, too short, and also constructed of a low thread count weave.  This is not recommended for much of anything.  I left it sitting on the table on my patio for two days, and upon moving it, found that in this short space of time, the sunlight had bleached the exposed part several shades lighter to a yellowish tone.  The bang is now two toned.  Since the material is so low grade, I can't even cut it up for scraps.  It is going into the trash can."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These work perfectly in my Lowa hiking boots (Zephyr model). The boots run a little small so the high volume insoles made things a little bit too tight. These have a medium amount of cushioning at 1.6mm (some other SOLE insoles, including some I have, are 3.2mm). I can tell a difference.These insoles are supportive without feeling overly aggressive. I even got them completely soaked with water when it thunderstormed and after air drying in front of a simple fan for a day they appear as new. Actually, even when wet they still appeared (and functioned) perfect.I did not heat them in the oven to mold them. I just trimmed a little, stuck them in the boots, and went for it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a handy sun visor. It does not mess up my hair since it just slips on. It does not give me headaches. I frequently wear it in the car to help cut down on early morning or late afternoon sun glare. On a breezy day it does not flip away from my face like the brim of my favorite sun hat. When I am going inside and outside I can slip it around my neck so it doesn't get misplaced. This makes it very convenient when traveling and sightseeing. I currently have 2 in go-with-everything black and tan colors."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have to say that I have bought several kinds of visors on Amazon and these are my &#34;GO-TO&#34; visors.  Shipped quickly and arrives in good shape, looks great, can easily be kept behind my car seat for when I need it, it doesn't hurt my head AND most of all, the skinny sides don't ruin my short hairstyle when I take it off or put it on!  I'm on my 3rd one...they are really comfy and useful in the hot California sun and wind!  (o:"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm 6'4\" and 300lbs, ordered a XXXL and it fits just the way I like it. Sliped over the t-shirt/sweater I was wearing with room to breathe.  Quality of stitching and workmanship overall is quite good.  Has a permanently attached hood that would do well to go over a baseball cap to keep it off your eyes. Stuffs backwards into the zippered front pocket fairly easily.  Not lined, so don't expect it to keep you warm but it will contribute to warmth by acting as a wind barrier via layering effect.  It will be a while before I have the chance to try the rainproofness. Very happy with the purchase."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is my second casio watch and I like my purchase.  The face of the watch is bit larger than a quarter.  It is pretty much unisex, I had no qualms using it.  My wrist are thin, and this watch looks great.  The best part about the watch is that it is pretty much waterproof so I don't fear it breaking when I forget to take it off when I for instance wash the dishes.  It is durable, the face can scratch easily but so far I have taken good care of it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Finally, finally, finally a strapless bra that is still where I put it on  when I take it off as long as 9 - 10 hours later.  I have never owned a strapless bra that did not, quickly or within 2 hours end up at my waistline unless I was continually tugging, pulling and wiggling it up to where it was meant to be.  It does not slide sideways either, I have had some that actually turned sideways unless I cinched them up to the point that breathing was a difficulty.  This bra is also comfy and has a good amount of cushion for softness.The fit is very true.  Wash in cold water and hang up to dry.  I am considering ordering another on just because it has taken me 40 years to find one that really works, I am worried it will disappear and I will not be able to get another one."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The fit is good, the color is perfect, the quality is great,  but, the All-Star emblem is on the INSIDE ankle of each shoe. NO, they are NOT on the wrong feet. Dad, Mom, and grandparents checked for right shoe on the right foot. Yep! Both shoes were on the correct feet. This pair of Chuck Taylor All-Star Hi- Top Kelly Green Canvas Shoes are DIFFERENT, but we will definitely keep them and our granddaughter cannot wait to wear them to school to show her Hi Fashion Friends. Will we buy others? Absolutely!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear these shirts for my job (they are given to us, and must be tucked in when worn) and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate. They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you're very fat... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have liked Dickies products for a long time now.  The work shirts are just slightly larger than a T-shirt would fit.  I understand most mechanics or workers like it a little looser, but it will not fit exactly like a T-shirt might.  It also won't shrink much, if it all, because of the materials it is made from.It keeps you relatively cool, it's very comfortable and durable.  Pretty good price for the quality as well.  Looks good as a work shirt or a casual shirt."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "i absolutely love these shirts for work and for play. i am 5'10\" 185lbs and on the muscular/beefy side and i wear a medium. everything else in the world, i wear a large. even the t shirt under my Dickies shirt (that i am wearing as we speak) is a large. i never need to iron these shirts and they look great and hold up well for the ship work, construction work, and office work that i do. if Dickies could get their sizing more consistent i would buy more of their products."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are very good shirts, great quality for the price and colors match what you see, but with a caveat, They are NOT outdoor-type shirts, and I wouldn't recommend them for barbecues (as the cook, I mean), mowing the lawn, golf, etc. They just don't breathe that well. But, if you're looking for a nice sturdy well-knit short sleeve to wear to work, or to other events, this is the way to go. In other words: classy, sturdy, and overall a good deal. It's not a light, &#34;stay cool&#34; athletic shirt, but works for everything else, it's better than I expected."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit. The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in, but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much. We're required to wear these where I work, and tucked in, so the strange (boxy almost) cut makes it keep coming untucked. The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit, I would but a million!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love Dickies products. They fit nicely, look good and, most importantly, last a long time due to the rugged construction. I only wear short-sleeved shirts because I'm always hot. The shirt and the color are perfect for me to wear in my business casual work environment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, when you take it out of the plastic bag that it comes in, it has a pesticide smell to it. You really have to wash it before wearing to get rid of the smell. But, I do understand why they treat the shirts with the pesticide, it sure beats the alternative."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband really likes these shirts, so they must be comfy.  However he said the second one I ordered for him was a little bit smaller than the first even though I ordered the same size.  He says it still fits him, but I know how picky he is and I'm hoping it doesn't end up at the back of his closet like most do.  I should ad that with these shirts - I do not have to iron them!Update:  So far he is wearing all of the shirts, these are his favorite.  Also the sizing is on the larger side, for this brand we ordered one size down from his usual and I should point out he only likes a 'relaxed' style shirt."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'VE BEEN WEARING THESE PANTS FOR 30 YEARS.  YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE AMERICAN MADE  THEY WERE TRUE TO SIZE.  NOW THAT ARE MADE IN HONDURAS, THEY SEEM TO BE CUT A HALF SIZE TOO TIGHT.  I'M USUALLY A 38 WAIST, BUT IN DICKIES THE 38'S SEEM TIGHT WHEN I SIT DOWN.  I HAVE TO WEAR THE NEXT SIZE UP (40 WAIST ) TO FEEL COMFORTABLE.AS FAR AS DURABILITY IS CONCERNED, THEY WASH WELL WITH OUT FADING AND CAN HOLD UP TO HEAVY WEAR AND TEAR"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "While it takes a good 4 or 5 washes to soften up, I am very pleased with these pants. They have a nice wide leg opening so they have room to breath, room to bend, while I don't work anymore, if I did these would be great work pants because you can move around easily in them and the knees are reinforced both great qualities for trades people. My only complaints would be that the front pockets are cut at a slant that if you lay down in them or even sitting in the car your change/keys fall out of your pockets. The other complaint is that they come with a crease in them and while the crease came out after several washes and a few passes with an iron, I don't see the need for the crease in work pants. Otherwise I would highly recommend these to anyone looking to put forth a little effort to get a great pair of work pants that I think will last quite a whle."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased two pairs of these Dickies Men's Loose Fit Double Knee Work pants in different colors for family members at home who needed new work pants.  They requested the size they needed and I placed the order.  They are very impressed with the fit, comfort, and quality of these pants which are excellent.  Although there are so many different types of Dickies (different styles, quality, and colors), to choose from on the Amazon website, these pants are very impressive.  The seller has advertised these pants with a complete and accurate description. The delivery was very fast, the packaging was excellent.  All the men in my family who have ordered these Dickies pants are enjoying their purchase, they are happy, impressed, and would recommend these pants to others who would be interested in a great quality work pants.  The price is reasonable, they come in an array of various colors, and I plan to purchase more in the near future."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Ah, actually... Some of us retired gray-beards in my neighborhood decided to form an &#34;Old Codgers&#34; club, and denim overalls are the approved uniform. We wear them while sitting in the shade, feeding the birds, and talking about our ailments. These Dickies overalls are great for that purpose! There are pockets enough for phone, watch & chain, pocket knife, handkerchief, wallet, sunflower seeds,whatever the aspiring Codger needs during his day. The material is quite durable, without being too heavy.They do come a bit long, but that is because they are meant to be worn with turned-up cuffs. All things considered, I highly recommend them!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have two of these jackets.  and Love 'em.  I'm 5'6&#34; tall, and 150 pounds.  So I'm made for a Med.  The synthetic fleece lining is soft and warm, and the rip-stop shell is durable, and wrinkle resistant. The hood, is lined, and adjustable, via stretchy  shock cord, which is also used at the waist. The sleeves, are lined with nylon, and insulated.  This makes it easy to pull on and off over a heavy sweater.  Since this jacket is of all synthetic materials, It will dry much more quickly than cotton.  One inside pocket, Slash hand warming pockets. The chest and waist, are very roomy.  but the sleeves, not so much.The elastic in the cuffs, is snug, and not adjustable,  but OK."}

Now that Mervyn's is out of business and I need to replace aging Jeans.I gave these a try based on the reviews here. Fit is very good. (I'm slender 6' 160lbs) Jean material is thick, overall well made. I have bought 2 pairs now. (Dk stone and stone wash). Very happy with these jeans.. I will buy more before the holiday sale ends.Update: 4-20-12. I have 6 pairs now. They have held up very well for 6 months washing and drying. Quality is as good or better than Levi's or Lee jeans. Material is definitely thicker than both. PRICE is fantastic at ~$25. I only wish they had 31\" waist which fits me a little better."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I go thru allot of jeans. I am always looking for jeans, the knees wear thru quickly, and work says no ripped or torn jeans allowed. Carhart is supposed to be the big name in hard working clothes, so I paid the extra money to try some out. They fit great, and seem fairly well built, but, the denim is so thin. I have bought rustlers from a dept store for less than half the price, that have denim twice as thick and strong. So far these have held up, but are showing signs of wear already, I don't see then lasting as long as other jeans I purchased for less money. When I ordered these I also ordered two pairs of dickies jeans. Dickies are cheaper and unless I look at the label I can't tell the difference. Both are really thin denim."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was so disappointed with these jeans.  I got them tried them on and thought these are what I have been waiting on.  I desired to have a pair of carpenter type of jeans tha tkept their shape for at lease longer than a day.  The day I put these jeans on, I was so excited about reaching my goal.  Well, I was totally surprised when on the day of putting these pants on, that within four hours theses pants are 'bigger and longer&#34;.  This is what I did not want at all. I thought trying this brand would remedy the problem that I have with other brands with this type of jeans.  Would I buy them again-NO! NO! NO!.  The process of the delivery of the jeans to my home was great without any problems or complications."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've had a very hard time finding good, well made, long lasting pants and jeans and in my size.  Due to disability I'm not able to exercise like I used to and I've gotten fat (why lie?) and finding sizes that fit are not that easy.  But even when I was slimmer I noticed that jeans and pants were not lasting as long as they used to. Belt hoops break off, zippers break and on one occasion the inseam from the crotch to the knee simply tore away as if weak threading.Not with CArhartt!  Tough, well sewn and made jeans that you can tell the firs time you hold them they were made to take a beating and keep going!  The size was perfect, fit was perfect, they hold their looks and the price was amazing, a sales price that was unbelievable.  Their regular prices are ok with me as you really do get what you pay for! Thanks Carhartt and Amazon!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered the \"Brown\" color (not the \"Carhartt Brown\" or \"Dark Brown\") and I wasn't sure what I'd receive because the color swatch for Brown on the product page looks more like a moss green.  The Brown I received can be described as a rust color, a shade of orange-brown.  It's nice, just wanted to share the info on what the color actually looks like.  The pants are the sturdiest I've ever owned, my wife was laughing because it kept its body shape when I took it off and placed it on the ground."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered two of these Carhartt long sleeve shirts, one in \"Ash\" color, the other \"Navy\" blue. I've had some trouble finding real cotton long sleeve T-shirts (I mean NOT cotton/algodon which is thin and rough feeling) the reason I bought them at Amazon was I've returned so many bought at JCP and Macy and thought I read the description to trust Amazon. ok, the shirts arrived and right away I notice the Ash shirt has that rough feel. Each is made in another country, the Ash is marked 99% cotton and made in Dominican Republic; the blue one is 100% cotton made in Honduras. The Ash shirt shrunk in the first wash so much the sleeves are too short to wear it unless I push up the sleeve. The Blue shirt is fine quality shirt all around. So I'm saying be careful...we just don't know nowdays what we will get for our money."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This jacket fits well and more importantly, functions well.  I used it for lower temperatures and with a long sleeved wicking shirt, felt warm and comfortable. I thought it might be too noisy but I don't mind the slight sounds of my arms swishing against the body of the jacket.  It's so light and wicks well. When I take it off, after 3-5 mile runs, the inside may be moist but I'm not.  I have another rain jacket that leaves me feeling clammy after a brisk walk so I can appreciate the difference .  I love it!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got these for my husband to play golf in (he's a boxer lover and not boxer-briefs) The photo on the model doesn't accurately show it these fit my husband (looser around the thighs and he's got muscular thighs). He wore them one day and has asked me to order enough to throw out ALL of his old boxers from different brands. Super light weight, feels great against his skin, wicks sweat, keeps him cool. He's a 36-38 waist and I got him a Large."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Being well endowed,I have a hard time finding boxers that fit just right.These boxers go on smooth,you can hang loose without falling out,yet it gives you room to grow if need be,also I like the back,just hugs the butt just enough yet stays loose. It feels like your wearing \"bear\"ly nothing.You can sleep in these,if you wish,(won't ride up),lounge and exercise in them.Being hairy,I noticed the white and lite colours boxers,there is some see thru.Also,they do not stick to the skin and living here in the South,we sweat so odor is wicked away.Can wear under shorts and dress/causal pants,jeans with ease. Highly recommend these boxers."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Ive tried many different types of boxers/boxer briefs, these are amazing. After 6 months neither pair has any sign of wear or waist elastic becoming loose or frayed - they appear brand new. VERY cool, comfortable, and they DONT RIDE UP. Super easy to wash in sink and dry really fast. I just bought 2 more pairs so I have 4 different colors. I will never buy any other type of underwear again, without a doubt. Theyre pricey for boxers but their comfort and durability and versatility are absolutely 100% worth it.The fact that I took the time to write a review about a pair of boxers says something in itself as to how great they are."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought a few of these Give-n-Go Briefs for my fianc&eacute;, We were a bit uneasy about size but we went with the (MEDIUM) and that was perfect. We were planning a hiking trip and it was going to be sunny and hot and it was! He wore these briefs the whole trip. They are super easy to wash ring and let air dry, in about 15 min depending on your environment The material is lightweight and very flexible with a sturdy waist band. Even after the trip was over they have proven to work at keeping the area dry and comfortable while doing everyday sweaty tasks. They were a great buy and soon we will add more until thats all the drawer will have."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I can't add much to the overwhelmingly positive reviews. These are the most comfortable underwear, quickest drying, stay dry, easy to clean, least smelling pairs I've had.They would actually make a great gift because a lot of guys probably will not spend this much for a pair, although I am just mad I didn't sooner. But because of that, think about it. The packaging is nice also and gives a lot of info on why they are so great. So treat yourself or someone who deserves a great item."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are expensive but the quality is great and the fit is athletic without being restrictive.  I needed underwear for what they are designed for: washing in a hotel sink and throwing over a shower rod.  They dry super fast (few hours usually if hung in ample air circulation.  They are very comfortable, don't get damp.  The fit is a bit loose but in the right way: not dumpy and keep things where they are supposed to stay. Unlike cotton shirts, they don't wrinkle or look hammered after frequent use."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been trying tons of underwear over the years not really happy with any for whatever reason. These are hands down the best. Spend the extra $$ theyre super comfortable, will last forever, you can hand wash and they dry in no time (you can wring them out and put them on within 2 mins of washing and your body will totally dry them the rest of the way fast. Could maybe use a button or more front overlap of the flaps but no big deal. I bought one pair then bought 3 more, will never wear anything else."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Sizing: I'm 6'3, 220, 37 waist.  The large seems to be too big. They are little loose like boxers, especially in the crotch.  For $18, I would not go this route again.  Hanes sport boxer briefs at the store are about $3 cheaper and fit a whole lot better.  These exofficios also ride up the leg with general wear.Drying:  I did try out the speedy wash/dry.  Yes, they dry quickly.  This is a bonus; however, I have not compared this to other makes with the same general material. Is it really that special?  I don't know, maybe I am missing something.  But these boxer briefs don't seem to be worth the money I paid."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Buy as many pairs of these as you can afford.  I bought one pair at a bass pro shop in LA and I was hooked. Yes they are expensive but they don't: bind, cut in, chafe from sweat, and can last several days without their unwashed nature being noticed.As an experiment I washed them in the shower wrung them out and wore them wet under my pants in the south. It was 90 degrees outside and they stayed cool for about two hours then dried. Which was very nice. My girlfriend thought I was nuts and told me so regularly.So I bought 4 more pairs. One boxer, one brief, and two boxer briefs. The 80$ took some consideration and courage but they are that good.A side consideration: I bought them in all colors but white. Don't buy white underwear you plan on wearing for days and washing in the sink. Ha ha."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Worth every penny, especially if you wait for them to go on sale.  Try one pair to start, because they may not be your thing, but I find they give slight support and chaffing protection both while wearing slacks and blue jeans.  The waist band of many other brands has been a problem for me in the past, but these have given me only minor comfort issues, usually revolving around the rise of my slacks or jeans coupled with my belt while sitting down.  The only way to avoid this completely is to have them painted on I think.  Have not tested their extreme adventure utility yet, but they have served me well on a trip back home to see the parents, and the packability made them easy to get into a crowded carry on."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "positives - seems great quality, looks like it will last a long time, washes easily, great to use as workout briefs... but I wouldn't go so far as the say like some people I'll buy a bunch and have them as my daily go-tos.negatives - came with a single loop of elastic coming out from it... I decided not to cut it. hopefully this doesn't unravel some of the elastic lining at the top. Also, the material wasn't quite as I expected as it looks in the pictures. I was expecting it to be a little more smooth, but this still isn't bad at all."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So, purchase a pair of these because I was sick of the 'Hanes' and 'Fruit of the Loom' pairs riding up, sweating through them, and loosing elastic so quickly.  And these are an improvement over the 'typical underwear'.  However, I did also purchase \"Champion Elite Active Fit Boxer Brief 3 Pack No Ride up\", and these fit and wear so much better.  For the money, the Champion Elite is much better!  The ExOfficio still 'rides up', and picking wedges is umcomfortable and embarrassing!  Maybe a small would fit me better?  Not sure, I am a 34 waist and the sizing guideline said to go with a medium.  Not willing to drop another $20 to try the small.......  The material feels nice - smooth and soft.Overall the Champion Elite are a better choice in my opinion, no ride up, and cheaper per pair."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The main reason why I got this underwear is because I experience much chafing with other underwear that will get wet, have rigid sewing lines, and have little bits of cotton ball up inside of them, all of which attribute to chafing.  I bodybuild, so at 6'2&#34; 250 lbs, no chafing is important to me.  Also, these are great for exercising, which is also a plus.  They will never rip from squatting, and they dry quickly, making sweating more comfortable.  Oh yeah, back to chafing.  These eliminated any and all chafing I had.  Also, I like that they have extra space around the balls for more airiness.  They can ride up, but the fabric is so comfortable that it doesn't bother me if it does happen although these do seem to ride up less often than Hanes and the like."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Works as advertised, comfortable, quick drying with minimal care.  The material is very stretchy so it moves with your body during activities.  They pack small and light so you can take a few with you during travel; although you won't need many as they are easy to handwash and quick to dry.One of my favorite items offered by Exofficio.Normally, I use the boxer briefs only for travel but am slowly working them into everyday rotation.  I just need to buy more.The only downsides are that colors limited and the boxer briefs can get expensive.  However, prices are known to drop from time to time so wait and get them when they are 45-50% off the $30 MSRP."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The idea is that you can take a couple pairs of these and wear one while you wash the other in a sink, minimizing the underwear you have to bring on a trip. The problem is that they don't feel that comfortable. There is little to not support, and they feel sort of scratchy on my skin. I always know they are there.Underwear doesn't take that much space so when packing it isn't a problem to take a few extra, and honestly my Under Armour does not wash inferiorly."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These underwear are absolutely the best!  I have tried a number of athletic boxer briefs, but these are my favorite.  They stay cool and dry in our hot AZ summers.  They breath well and don't turn into a swamp.  They are comfortable and fit great.  I have a 32\" waist and the small fits great.  The elastic does not roll like some of my Champion boxer briefs and there is minimal bunching or riding up.  I just wish they were a little cheaper, but they are worth it.  I buy a couple at a time until I can phase out my old boxer briefs.  Try a pair and you will never want to wear anything else."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I travel regularly for work and I now only take a couple pairs of these boxer briefs with me on trips. I've always enjoyed traveling light but socks and underwear can take up a surprising amount of room in a suitcase when you need to plan for more than a week or two. I can now comfortably get by with only two pairs of boxer briefs and a couple pairs of socks (drymax). This pair was purchased to add to my current supply but the original pairs have held up well and I have no complaints about them. If you follow the directions that come with the product, they dry incredibly quickly (a few hours at the most)."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got tired of hearing my boyfriend complain of never having clean underwear so as a sorta gag gift I got him a variety of different brands. So for a week he was getting underwear from amazon with a gift note&#8230; it made for an amusing week of texts. But he did fall in love with the ExOfficio. He loved the fabric and I end up buying him more because I&#8217;m just awesome like that (and because he seemed to only wear one pair&#8230;) So I will recommend them on his behalf."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these for my husband who was frustrated with his cotton boxer briefs during long runs and workouts. He reported that these wick moisture very well and is extremely happy. We wash these with our dry fit clothes using penguin wash and hang dry them so that they hold up longer. They truly do dry quickly, so I'm sure they will be fantstic for travelling. They appear to be made very well - quality product. I'll update this again if we find otherwise. He has 4 pairs, so we'll see. Also, these do appear to run true to size."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are, by far, the best underwear on the planet. They stretch and breathe better than anything Under Armour or Nike make. You can wash them in a sink, and they dry in a few hours. They are also very, very resistant to any odor accumulation.They are almost indestructible. I've had a couple of pairs for a few years, which I workout in every day. I stretch and squat with them, which normal cotton underwear just ripped after a couple of months. They are also more comfortable because they do stretch so easily.They're expensive, but they're worth it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "definitely the best underwear I have ever owned. I have tried soooooo many different styles and pairs. I have been hunting for the perfect fit, comfortable waist, something that doesn't ride up the back or the crotch, gives adequate cup support and is ventilated.  This might be the miracle undergarment.  Plus, they actually do dry quickly. I travel light and have actually washed them in the sink. By morning . . . . clean and dry! These have replaced my everyday wear. I don't wear these to the gym, as I prefer something with even more cup support, but for a light workout, these would be great."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought two pairs of these.  Size small, I'm 5'7&#34;, waist 32&#34;.  The fit is good, but I feel like the Under Armour boxerjocks offer much better compression.  Just a tight feel all around.  The problem with both is that they make me hot.  It's hard to wear these on a regular basis because they don't offer the breathing room like regular boxers do.  I was hoping that these ExOfficio boxers were a little &#34;cooler&#34;, but they were not.  I'll be wearing these to play sports, but not for daily use."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "While I can't comment on the washing/drying of this item because I strictly wash with regular laundry, I found myself disappointed on the support of the 'main compartment' with these.  They did get the leg support right, and I did not find that wearing these caused any ride ups throughout the day, but beyond that am not impressed.  I tried out the UA Boxerjock and it seems to be the opposite, where the central chamber provides great support but the legs ride up regularly.With that said, I can't recommend these because of the lack of support for the cost of the boxer briefs."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I don't see what the big fuss is about these. I gave these a try since I was sucked in by all these 5 star reviews and expected something mind-blowing. Sadly, I was dissapointed.  The elastic waistband is way too thick and stiff. I can feel it digging into my stomach and sides when I sit down. The legs do not have any elastic so the ride up and bunch. For the price these are not worth it. I would rather spend more money and get something more comfortable like Under Armour's boxers."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Received these briefs and they came as advertised.  They seem well constructed and fit real nice.  Very good fit and comfortable in comparison to the 100% cotton boxer briefs I now wear.  I like how light and breathable they are for sure.The big test happens next month on my Germany Journey.  I am only going to take the 4 with me for a 10 day trip.  I will hand wash every other day or so, what I need as I am only going to pack a carry on bag for the trip.  I am taking sports t's to wear under my polo shirts and will do the same, thus saving more room and weight.So far they look like they will do a good job.  If anything changes on the trip, I will update.  So far 5 star. But if they work as well as I think they will I might just say goodbye to the old cotton boxer briefs!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've got to say, I never thought as a jeans and work-shirt kind of a guy I'd get all excited about some new underwear, but here I am writing a glowing review!These are the best undershorts ever!I've been a Fruit-of-the-loom kind of a guy for 50 years.  Saw these as a lightning Deal and bought four pair.  Now these are my go-to shorts!  Spendy?  Yup, but worth every penny.  Fast washing and drying.  Can sink-wash them and hang them over the shower-rod and they will be completely dry by morning.  Super comfortable, great waistband.I like these so much, I've added them to my wishlist too!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are the most comfortable pair of boxer briefs I've ever worn.  I have a 30\" waist so I went with the medium, though I could have easily gone small.  Very roomy and appear to be durable.  I'm sure hand washing will extend the life twofold at the very least.  I'd also like to mention that ExOfficio's athletic clothing, shirts, these boxers, etc all dry in amazing time.  They will dry in less than a half hour indoors and around 5 minutes or less outside in warm weather- most likely less time in direct sunlight on a hot day."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "For a few years I have wore the Jockey GO Mesh boxers - same idea - you really only need 2 pairs on a trip of about any number of days.  I actually ended up wearing them every day, for everything.Canoeing, woods, fishing, hunting, etc...I will never go back to cotton again.For reasons I can't imagine...Jockey quit making those and I have been on a search for a few months to find more.  I get about 1 year out of a pair, or at least I used to.The Good news - I found these!  The \"pouch\" is much larger in these and more comfortable...and the fabric is even more \"airy\".  Really nice when it's 105 degrees and you are sweating your tail off!I ordered 2 pair to try - loved them - and now came back to order 3 more pair.Yes, it's a lot to pay for a pair of underwear...but to me, they are worth every penny."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought a few pairs of these several summers ago and thought they were amazing.  I think I had a total of 5 or 6 pairs, and wore them for hiking/camping etc, but also every-day use.They hold up great, wick awesomely, and I've seen very little to no wearing out from washing them, or even drying on high heat...although you can of course just air dry them in little to no time.Meanwhile, this past year I had a puppy who liked to get into my dirty clothes and eat them, and I was down to only 3 pairs left so I decided to order more!These are seriously the best underwear that you can buy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "5'6 143 lbs, 30 in. waist.  Small fits well.  Not quite as much support as a brief but certainly acceptable.  Material is excellent at breathing/wicking and doesn't turn your backside into swamp### if you end up sweating a lot.I machine wash cold, gentle/delicate cycle, basic detergent, and then air dry.  You can wrap these in a towel or put them into the dryer on low heat+gentle if you need them asap.They seem to hold up well & I continually buy a few pairs at a time to pretend they don't cost much.  I won't go back to cotton."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Recently purchased this product, and I am satisfied withe the quality of this product. Here's a break down of the pros and cons. One of the best pairs of brief I own and I would say it's arguably better than most Calvin Klein briefs and other competitors.Pros:-Highly comfortable-Durable material-Material maintains it's consistency, shape, and tightness. Doesn't loosen after washing or change in any way.-Quick-drying-Length is perfect-Waist band is comfortable doesn't squeeze or irritate at all.-Smooth durable materialCons:- If there is any, you could argue the price for one pair is a bit high, that's for you to decide.Conclusion: I certainly recommend this product, it's just a very well made product. This product does stand out, it's not like the other products."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Years ago these were the best briefs you could buy.  I ordered several packs. So far I have thrown away about one third of the briefs.  Some fit perfectly.  The ones I have thrown out have had the following problems.  About three had the elastic in the leg section so tight I could hardly get them on.  Four had the elastic stretch out within minutes like I was wearing bloomers. A couple seemed to be a smaller size than the rest.Apparently these are made without attention to consistent quality.  Needless to say I won't be purchasing these again.  I guess I'll have to go back to buying Fruit of the Loom.  I don't throw as many of those out and they are much cheaper.  If anyone knows of a good pouch brief out there please let me know."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Take care of it. I've never had a shoe tree before. It's awesome. As time passes my feet have gotten wider. This means my long time shoes need a little help ( I  have a bunion on one foot) for me to keep enjoying them. These Woodlore  Adjustable Shoe Trees seem to be made well, especially compared to a plastic counterpart. It makes cleaning and appreciating my shoes easier, plus the cedar helps shoes smell good.  I've already bought another shoe tree for a pair of lovely boots. Take care of your shoes so they take care of you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I use these in my cowboy boots and they have done a wonderful job of keeping the toes from curling up with infrequent use. All of my boots are exotics and require dressing to be applied quite frequently. With these in place the task becomes a joy instead of a chore. I am going to buy many more pairs! By the way they fit perfectly and are very easy to put in or take out. I use my boot jack hooks to remove them as my arthritic fingers are no longer up to the task."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the third review of an irish album I write today (the others were Cranberries) and now I'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world. And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way. Okay, I just wanted to say something about Irish  music. Now let's say something about this album. It's great. it's  beautiful. Very good, easy listened music. If you like Enya or you just  want some easy-listened relaxing music. This is the album for you to buy!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "(...)She is one of a kind, and this album only enhances her contribution to musical enjoyment. As always, the instrumental opening sets a mood, followed by the lively \"Anywhere Is\", a song which grew on me each time I listened. Each song is exquisite, but for me, \"China Roses\" is the most delicately crafted song. However, \"Once You Had Gold\" which isn't mentioned as much is another of the highpoints. \"On My Way Home\" is a fitting conclusion to the album. I have heard rumors that not everybody likes Enya, and if there is a person who doesn't like her, then he or she shouldn't get this CD, but for everybody else, this is one of the essential CD's for your collection."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Changing Faces' recording career was off to a good start with this self-titled debut album. The name Changing Faces alluded to changing trends in 1990s R&B, which was moving away from new jack swing and toward a softer type of medium-tempo groove. In fact, pretty much everything on this CD, favors a medium tempo sound-- the New York duo doesn't overwhelm the listener with either slow ballads or fast material. Cassandra Lucas and Charisse Rose, collectively Changing Faces, are strong singers -- and while slow jams like \"Thoughts of You,\" \"Movin' On,\" and \"Come Closer\" aren't mind-blowing, they're pleasant enough. Not surprisingly, \"Foolin' Around\" and \"Stroke You Up\" (both written and produced by R. Kelly) became major hits."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is jus a good r and b album that still sounds good on 9/11/09.  I already heard Foolin Around, Stroke U Up, Keep it Right There, and now I am finally listening to more from Changing Faces.  All of the songs are so consistant and flow 2gether in that loving, good vibe way.  The sounds of the early 90's are precious.  I luv the song \"Am I Wasting My Time\".  I only wish I could find the remix for \"Feeling All This Luv\".  I bought the cd for that song but it's jus the album cut.  I had it on the cassette single for Foolin Around.  Every song on here is gr8, no skip-overs, get this baby.  I got this!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "For the most part, The Cars were a singles band, but their debut stands as one of the best ever new wave albums.  The hit songs were solid, including the amazing threesome, &quot;Let the Good Times Roll,&quot; &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; and &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; that kick off the album.  But side two is were The Cars demonstrate their artistic complexity, particularly on the lengthy double track &quot;Moving in Stereo/All Mixed Up.&quot;  &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; make for another couple of great singles as well.  This album is so good, it could stand as a greatest hits package all on its own."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I originally had the Cars debut on 8track twenty something years ago--The tape pulled out (remember how 8 tracks did that?) so I bought the record album--after playing it soooo many times I was able to see through it--I  went and bought the cassette--needless to say--I wore it out too. I now  have the CD and am trying my hardest to wear it out. The format may wear  out but great tunes never die--I must have listened to the Cars debut album  over a thousand times--it's still great. A classic among classics."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In my view, this album by itself represents the birth of New Wave (that is, before it had a name).  When the Cars released this, their first, there simply was no other sound like it--and it would take years before other artists even came close to reproducing the cool, beat-laden, tech-heavy resonances of such songs as Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl, Just What I needed, You're All I've Got Tonight, and the terrific combination of Moving in Stereo and All Mixed Up.  In short, mock all you want the haircuts and vapid lyrics of the boy bands which came later, but this one is real, hard, and as original as it gets."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's ridiculous how many bands nowadays blatantly rip off the Cars without anyone calling them on their crap.  \"Stacy's Mom,\" anyone?  Weezer or Hot Hot Heat, perhaps?The reason for all of this idolatry is, of course, because the Cars' debut album is still one of the freshest and most vital pop albums ever.  The record was released in 1978, and it never ceases to amaze me with just how timelessly perfect it still sounds.With simple, catchy, and infinitely memorable songs, the Cars' debut is the official soundtrack to a good time.  Easily one of the 70s' best.  \"Just What I Needed\" is among my top five favorite pop songs ever."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "After years of listenting to metal/rock/pop/... rock, I heard this album...and the world turned on it's head for a moment (for me, of course)...my first intro to something other than 'Free Burd', and although  it took some getting used to, this still remains on my list as one of the  best new-wave/rock classic albums of all time.  The 'best of' they did  covers the hits, but this CD, from start to finish, is a work of new-wave  art - rarely matched by their contemporaries (except maybe the 1st  Pretenders album...).They (The Cars) brought cynicism to a new level,  without being obsessed with anger/etc.  This CD has an underlying power to  it that is unmatched by others - one that will remain as a CD that listened  today (20 years on) for a reason beyond their sheer popularity."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "You know,even with classic radio hits like &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;,&quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B&quot; I just can't putThe Beach Boys &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; into my CD player and not listen tothe entire album in one sitting!I'd be missing out on my favoritesongs like &quot;Don't Talk&quot;,&quot;Let's Go Away For Awile&quot;,&quot;Caroline No&quot;,&quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;...I can go on and on,really!This has less weak cuts then The Beatles &quot;Sgt.Pepper&quot; and thatonly had ONE mildly weak song if that tells you anything.Okay-order this NOW!It will brighten your day!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am very disapointed! After looking for this album for 10 years, at least I bought it and ... masterpiece?C'mon people! I have around 2000 Rock albums in my collection and I would never placed this not even between the top 100.How could anyone say that Rubber Soul or Revolver are under Pet Sounds? Any 60's Rolling Stone album is one hundred times better. And something else, if this is the sound that shape the American pop music, I might be wrong, but ... where is Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters, Miles Davis, etc? Those are really masters of American music, not The Beach Boys.I can't give to this album more than half star."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "PET SOUNDS.....hauntingly beautiful,stunningly majestic,fantastically..oh look wait a minute!!lets cut to the chase!!REPEAT AFTER ME.I MUST OWN THIS ALBUM,I MUST OWN THIS ALBUM....or sadly yes youve guessed it it means booking an appointment in the funny farm.Youve probably got SGT PEPPER right?well this came before and it was instrumental in THE BEATLES recording said masterpiece.BRIAN WILSON never really came near to this quantum leap project again bits of SURFS UP are ok HOLLAND has a few gems but this is the ONE.So.....REPEAT AFTER ME I MUST OWN .................."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am not a Beach Boys fan.I consider this one of the 4 or 5 greatest albums of all time.The trouble with this album is that it constantly points out the musical genius--and I do mean genius--Brian Wilson was, and leaves you wondering how he could have plummeted to the depths that would hit him within just a few months of PET SOUNDS.As much as I love &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B,&quot; they seem second tier when heard in the context of this album.  &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day,&quot; &quot;Here Today,&quot; &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; and &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; are all first rate Pop.PET SOUNDS also has what I consider to be the greatest Beach Boys track, &quot;Caroline No.&quot;  It is a perfect recording of a heartbreaking lyric."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No question, one of wonders of the digital is the chance for a work like this to be remixed in stereo, with an amazing soundstage.  Mark Linett deserves an award for the work he did with the multi-tracks to this album.  I've heard things I've never heard in the hundred times I've listened to  the mono Pet Sounds.  Putting the mono and stereo versions back to back  really shows the aural difference.For all that refuse to accept the  stero version and consider it some sort of sacrelige, hey, you have the  mono version.  But you are really depriving yourself.This classic got a  whole lot better.  For those of you that are Beatles fans as well, we can  only dream of the Beatles work getting the same treatment."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's true this is one of the best albums of all time. I'm not sure if I'd call it the second best album ever (Rolling Stone), but it is amazing. Even though &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as a whole is great, it's the hits that really stand-out, which include &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;, &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, and &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. But I also really like &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; and &quot;Caroline No&quot;. Other than being a classic among classics, this disc also includes the bonus track &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot;, and the entire album is repeated in stereo on tracks 15-27. For all these reasons I highly recommend getting &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. At least you should see what all the fuss is about."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The Beach Boys/ Pet Sounds (The complete Albums in Stereo & Mono):  This is a beautiful and absolutely classic album.  This particular single CD version of it gives us both the Mono and Stereo mixes.  Both are great.  I originally did not want to buy a bunch of individual albums by the Beach Boys.  I wanting instead a good compilation but, having been disappointed with the five-disk history set, I turned to the original albums.  I had the old LP of Pet Sounds many years ago and this CD is a revelation of brilliance and clarity.  I could not be happier with this CD, and am glad that I was not forced to buy the multi-disk Pet Sounds Sessions in order to own the album.  Highly Recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is universally regarded as the Beach Boys' masterpiece, and who am I to disagree?  You might say that this was the band's peak, but I would say that they actually peaked with the \"Good Vibrations\" single after this.  But Pet Sounds is certainly their peak from an album standpoint.  This album always ranks among the top ten albums of all time in any survey of critics, and rightly so.  If you can't appreciate how great this album is, I feel sorry for you."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I love the Beach Boys as much as anyone.  Let me say that again.  I love the BEACH Boys as much as anyone.  By that I mean I love the Beach Boys who actually live up to their name, singing about the beach, girls, surfing, cars, and Rhonda.This is not the Beach Boys.  It can't be.  Why?  No beach songs!  I thought it was some kind of joke.  All &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes, backed by elevator music.  There's barely any Mike Love on the album at all.Way overrated."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Much has already been written about this masterpiece, one of the greatest LPs in the history of pop/rock. Two things about it, in particular, that I appreciate: one is that it demonstrates what imaginative studio production can be capable of - so many records today, by contrast, are overproduced, or simply badly produced, that they sound immediately stale; this, by contrast, sounds as fresh as the day it came out. The other thing about Pet Sounds that I love is that it, while not &quot;soul&quot; music per se, is a record with much personality and soul, and shows the value of introspection when one is a musical genius like Brian Wilson, the man who is mostly responsible for this."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought this CD back in August and I have only listened to it once(when I needed music to fall asleep to when there was nothing on the radio). I have heard that this CD is &quot;depressing&quot;, but when I heard it, I found  nothing depressing about. Maybe it was because I wasn't concentrating fully  on it, but I wasn't impressed. Maybe if I looked at the lyrics(if I could  find them) and found the true meaning of the songs I would like it better.  Maybe when I listen to it again, I'll give it a better review."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Like many other \"classics\" from its era, Pet Sounds simply hasn't stood the test of time, not because its sounds weren't ground-breaking for when it came out, but because most of the songs really haven't aged well. \"Wouldn't it Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows\" are absolute classics, but the best (and best known) of the remaining tracks, \"Sloop John B\", isn't even an original composition, and there's a reason that \"Caroline No\" is probably the only remaining track that non-owners of the album will have ever heard. This album is far more important for the influence it would have on The Beatles as a studio band than as a musical statement by Brian Wilson: it's certainly not unpleasant to listen to, but the second-greatest album of all time, as recently selected by Rolling Stone Magazine? Absurd."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "There is nothing that I can say about this album that hasn't already been said.. But I would like to express my profound moment of discovery when I first listened to it.. I had the preconception that the Beach boys were just a bunch of dumb surfers.. My musical tastes leaned towards jazz, classical, and more progressive rock.. But I kept on seeing this album on lists of the greatest albums of all time so.. I gave it a try. I wasn't prepared for the beauty of this perfect musical mixture of sounds and moods.. It was clearly a very personal record that expressed many feelings I had at the time.. the production is brilliant.. being a big fan of the beatles I immediately heard simmilarities between George Martinand Sgnt Pepper and how they must have been influenced by this record.. This is not surfer music - it is much more.."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The merits of this album need not be discussed here. Pet Sounds has been widely regarded as a pop classic for over forty years and its popularity shows no sign of letting up. What does need addressing, however, is the sound Capitol has achieved in rendering this recording in Mono on CD.The remastering game that has been going on for the past decade has yielded mixed results. Record companies promising superior sound have come up short more than half the time when it comes to reissuing classics. Lucky for us, that's hardly the case with this reissue of the Beach Boys' finest hour.Pet Sounds in Mono is what every fan hopes for when plunking down hard earned cash for an album he already owns. The sound is incredibly warm with every instrument coming through distinctly. The harmonies coalesce in a way you simply don't hear on a stereo mix. And the immediacy is impressive."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a masterpiece. I won't get into the Sgt. Peppers or Rubber Soul vs. Pet Sounds. I let this classic stand on its own. Brian Wilson stretched his wings on this one and the band followed. It is, at times, a little  uneven, but the music stands up. &quot;Wouldn't it be Nice&quot; and  &quot;God Only Knows&quot; are the deserved hits, but don't push aside the  other not-so-popular titles like &quot;I Just Wasn't Made for These  Times,&quot; &quot;I Know There's an Answer&quot; and probably the most  underrated Beach Boys song of all time, &quot;Caroline No.&quot; A truly  introspective album. It's deserving of the classic label. Truly a fantastic  album. The Beach Boys showed they could do more than just surf and drag."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Just lay back and listen. Brian Wilson never misses a note. His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop. His composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass (the slow middle eight section on &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;)on this album. These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling  both excited and uncertain. Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves, this is a true pop magnum opus. The best tracks are the gorgeous &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder&quot;), the title cut, and the tear inducing &quot;Caroline No&quot;. Instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity, Brian Wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that haven't aged a day since 1966. The more you listen to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, the more it's beauty envelopes you."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;Jazz Samba&quot; is such a great album that only one other bossa nova album exceeds its quality- &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;.  Getz and Byrd, jazz musicians, not only introduce Brazilian bossa nova to a larger audience, but do so in a way that is timeless.Many of the compositions here have become classics of our culture, &quot;Desifinda&quot;, &quot;Samba de Uma Nota S&oacute;&quot; and &quot;O Pato&quot;.  Don't worry if you don't recognize the titles, once you hear them you recognize the music.If you have &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; than &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; won't disappoint.  This is great music that belongs in everyone's collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's my first CD bought from Amazon and it's one of the best albums of Patti. Different styles but a unique big voice! Hear her Aretha's voice in the track 5, for example! Track 1 is a new version of the first song in her album \"Havana Candy\".  Track 2 shows us her \"Ability To Swing\". Tracks 3-4-10 are beautiful ballads. Track 6 is the reggae one. Tracks 7-8 have a sweet sound. Track 9 is my favourite of the album, in a gospel style."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A blessed union of amazing vocals and outstanding studio musicians make Patti Austin's THAT SECRET PLACE a dazzling achievement.Whether it's jazz or pop, R&B; or gospel, reggae or funk, Austin impeccably delivers a true command of whatever style she tackles.  In this 1994 release, each track allows Patti to effortlessly glide through each song with her penetrating performances.She cooks on tunes like ABILITY TO SWING, a scat-infused invitation to dance , her cover of Aretha's classic ROCK STEADY and the euphoric drive of REACH.  Have fun with her reggae-flavored CAPTIVATED.  Then let your heart melt with SOMEBODY MAKE ME LAUGH, BROKEN DREAMS or the gorgeous STARS IN YOUR EYES.  The album is flawlessly produced by jazz icons Lee Ritenour and Dave Grusin.Patti has certainly deserved wider success in her career, but for those who have wisely followed her know what a treasure she is!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you just stumbled across this album and gave it a listen, you might be forgiven for thinking that it's a greatest hits CD. At this point, AK already had a couple of albums under her belt, and it shows. The music is straight bluegrass and country, you won't find any of the later pop infusions (which is fine music itself!), and the song selection is first rate. The instrumentalists are in fine form, and her voice still has most of that thin,reedy quality that you associate with bluegrass. But if you listen, it's just beginning to warm up some and lose that young-girl quality ...So if you're already an AKUS fan, you can scoop this one up and enjoy every lick! And if not, this is as good a place as any to test the waters."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "On her 3rd CD Alison Krauss does not break stride.  &quot;I've Got That Old Feeling&quot; is chock-a-block FULL of the beautiful ballads that have made her famous with her angelically emotive voice, but it is also perhaps the best showcase for her ability to perform more up-tempo pieces, such as &quot;Dark Skies&quot; and &quot;Will You Be Leaving?&quot; The supporting cast here performs perfectly.How many albums do you have that have perhaps a few good songs on it, but just as many songs that are just filler - instantly forgettable and barely listenable?  This is a CD with NO filler.  Every cut is a &quot;keeper&quot; and I could just listen to the whole thing back to back over and over again.Alison Krauss is a national treasure, and this recording is one reason why."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I listen to a wide variety of music, and I think that Alison Krauss has the most beautiful voice in all of today's music.  The pop acts of today can't compare.  &quot;I've Got That Old Feeling&quot; has 12 exceptional songs from bluegrass to country including the title song, &quot;It's Over&quot;, and &quot;Wish I Still Had You&quot;.  Not only can Krauss sing, she plays the violin to perfection.  If you haven't listened to Alison Krauss yet, you are in for a treat!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I've had this CD a long time and it's still very enjoyable especially when you're in the right mood. My favorite songs are mostly the kind of wistful ballads where Alison's voice works great. My favorite songs here are \"I've Got That Old Feeling\", \"I Wish I Still Had You\", \"Winter of a Broken Heart\", \"It's Over\", \"Steel Rails\", \"That Makes One of Us\". Well that's half the album right there, and the other songs are good too. The production isn't as clear as more recent stuff, but the musicians are top notch. In the end some albums stick with you more than others, and this one stands out as a keeper."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I must admit this CD was in my shopping cart for quite a while given its genre.  I finally make the plunge when I needed it for free shipping and the first time I played it, I couldn't believe the beautiful purity and fullness of her voice.The music is very interesting also since it is obviuosly country, but these are real talented musicians and the arrangements are incredibly performed and make a country band  really kick-[...] in a cross over jazzy sense in a couple of tunes where you'd never guess this is a band that plays bluegrass.It's worth every one of those stars and one more if they had it.By the way, I found out that the ladies like this CD very much."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Since her Rounder debut in 1987, Alison Krauss has been praised by critics and country music fans alike. Revitalizing traditional styles of country music including bluegrass, the singer and fiddler is the focus of much public attention. Her unique, yet firmly-rooted approach to country music has won her several Grammys. Her 1995 release, NOW THAT I'VE FOUND YOU, showcases her ability to shine in a variety of settings. The title track and &quot;Broadway&quot; find Krauss in a more pop country environment; however even her pop music is unique in its smart harmonic structure, and her ability to avoid pat or stock poetic devices. On &quot;Tonight I'll Be Lonely Too,&quot; Krauss and Union Station (her almost constant musical companions) switch to a decidedly bluegrass feel, and on &quot;When God Dips His Pen of Love In My Heart,&quot; she plunges into a Southern gospel style with help from the Cox Family. Alison Krauss has the remarkable ability to make these diverse musical directions seem logical and congruent."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I'm not sure how this woman would be classified... I guess it's generally country music, with a hint of bluegrass.  But in certain songs, I also detected some gospel influence.  Note that I have NEVER been a country music lover.  My taste in music is very wide - West African, Brazilian, Greek, electronica, soul/funk, classic rock.  I saw Alison performing on public TV a few weeks ago, and was just blown away - so much so that I went out to buy the CD.Almost every track is wonderful in its own right.  Alison's voice is so beautiful, but I think it's the combination of all the talents on this CD that makes it so wonderful.  The song-writing is excellent, and the banjo pickin' is also.I'm so glad to have discovered her, and to now have this CD in my collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I heard Love at the Five and Dime on the radio (WWUH) one rainy morning in 1986 on my way to work in Hartford.  Nanci's fresh and honest sound was literally music to ears accustomed to machine-like synth-based 80's rock.  I immediately went over to Integrity 'n Music in Wethersfield and picked up a copy (in vinyl of course).  That cut plus Last of the True Believers and More than a Whisper proved riveting and honest.A few weeks later, in full fanship, I caught Nanci alone with her guitar (and the resident reptiles) at Roaring Brook Nature Center singing many of these same songs.  Later, her divorce and political stridency soured her music and furrowed her brow.  Her subsequent work was packed with beauty but she never again scaled these peaks of pure simplicity and romance."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a great album. Trust me. And what no one seems to remember is that these guys are Grammy Winners - yes, GRAMMY WINNERS -  for Best Instrumental of the Year for the fantastic D.N.A. from this, their debut album. This is a classic example of a band whose image was so strong ( who can forget THAT HAIR !! ) that it often overshadowed their talent ( another fine example is Culture Club ). Unfortunately, it was all downhill from here, as their popularity ( not to mention their creativity and their stability ) quickly waned. Very upbeat, energetic dance pop-rock, with just enough synths and effects to make it stand out in the crowd. My advice : skip the many \"best of\" compilations and go straight to this one. And when you get ridiculed for playing it, just like you did in high school ( you know who you are... ) do the Flock proud and  wear that freak badge with honor."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Self titled album that came out in 1982!1.  Space Age Love SongAwesome futuristic song about a guy falling for a girl2.  You can RunDrums and guitar riffs rule this.

{"label": 9, "raw": "KRS seemed more focused than ever here. During the making of this album, Scott La Rock, DJ and Producer of BDP was shot and killed. During the making of \"My Philosophy\" in fact...which in my opinion is when Kris started showing his true colors. It was positive and negative, educational and entertaining..which had become the mantra of KRS ever since. On this album he tells you that Illegal Business controls America. He tells you how sometimes love is gonna get you. On this album you learn what the \"word\" \"Unrational\" means."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a classic cd, period.  KRS-1 is a living legend, and this is him at his prime.  Songs like \"My Philosophy,\" \"Illegal Business,\" \"Stop the Violence,\" and \"Still #1\" are some of the most quoted/sampled in the last 20 years of hip hop.  If you think you don't know anything by KRS-1, one listen of this cd would prove you wrong  The list of rappers who have sampled or quoted songs on this cd is inexhaustible.  This was big when it came out in 88, and it sounds just as fresh today.  This is a gem among diamonds, a true hip hop classic. Even in Scott La Rock's absence, the production is stellar.  The lyrics are top-notch.  As close to a perfect hip-hop record as possible."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Krs-One is another one of those MCs, on a SHORT list of them, whose second album COMPLETELY took the first. By All Means Necessary was EXCELLENT, as he, just like Public Enemy did in 88, brought a conscious and more political state of awareness to hip hop. This album represents Krs in his true form, and it shows on EVERY song. Here's the review:Album Highlights: EVERY song is worth a listen.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Mattere: Thumbs up. Other than Public Enemy, who else was coming this political in 88?Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: This was a great moment for hip hop music. Krs-One came back in 88 for this second album and he didn't disappoint. If hip hop was still like this today, it would be so much better. One can only hope. Overall, I strongly recommend this album to any fan of hip hop, if you're into politically charged hip hop."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Classic album, many classic albums dropped around this time, Straight Outta Compton, No One Can Do It Better, Boomin Words From Hell, Great Adventures Of Slick Rick, Paid In Full, etc.  Too $hort is very underrated rapper, and this is one of his finest works.  His beats are just incredible.  In songs such as Mack Attack, there are some nice instrumental parts to the song, which shows off how good the beat is.  His storytelling is incredible, one of the greatest storytelling MC's ever.  Bottom line is, get this album if u havent already, its a timeless classic, all tracks are the best but my favorite is Mack Attack."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Billy Ocean fused R&amp;B/soul with pop/rock and ended up with an excellent album. &quot;Carribean Queen&quot; and &quot;Loverboy&quot; are both must-have 80's hits, and this album is the best place to hear them, because the versions here are much longer than the radio edits on his greatest hits CD! But then again, every song on this album is great, and the heartfelt cover of the Beatles' &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; should win over people who don't normally appreciate 80's music. But if you are a fan of the 80's, you definitely need this album, and if you aren't, get it anyway!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was on TV all the time to promote Carribean Queen as an 80s classic. I had never heard the song in its entirety, and it clocked in at just above 7 minutes long. Loverboy and Suddenly are also good songs, but not enough for me to rate it higher than a disappointment with the artist as a whole. This is another one of those Cds I found at Wal Mart for 5 bucks. I guess they're still trying to make their money back from the first press. Didn't even include credits, and no lyrics in the package."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "After recording several critically acclaimed albums for the GTO and Epic labels that did not exactly set the world on fire, Billy Ocean signed with Jive Records and hooked up with producer Keith Diamond who masterminded this classic 1984 release that made Billy Ocean a true superstar. The uptempo dance numbers &#34;Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)&#34;, &#34;Lover Boy&#34; and &#34;Mystery Lady&#34; all became huge hits but the title track was and is one of the most gorgeous ballads of its time and one which you can still regularly hear on adult contemporary stations throughout the country."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "After peaking at number 22 in 1976 with his first hit \"Love Really Hurts Without You\", Billy Ocean spent the better part of next eight years in near obscurity until he burst back on the scene with the number one hit \"Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)\".  It is an all-time great 80's hit with a slinky dance groove. It was followed up by \"Loverboy\" which was written by rock producer Mutt Lange and topped out at number two. It has a slick rock guitar crunch over a danceable beat.  The title track is a 180 from the first two tracks as it is a straight, syrupy ballad that soared up to number four on the charts.  The album peaked at number 9 and marked the start of Mr. Ocean's brief run as the one of the biggest singers in the world."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tear Down These Walls was Billy Ocean's final run at chart success.  The album features one of the most reviled songs from the 80's, \"Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car\".  It generally makes the list for worst songs from the 80's, but it is a little harsh as the song has a fun, innocent charm that seems to be missing from most songs these days.  It made its way to number one and it was the last time Mr. Ocean had a top ten single.  He became a casualty of the grunge movement in the early 90's as most 80's stars who were perceived to be soft met up with a similar chart demise."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This Billy Ocean album is still one of my favorites!  For him to follow the very successful Love Zone album with this platinum album is an understatement.  The big hits were Get Out of My Dreams, The Colour of Love, and Tear Down These Walls, but they're no contest to my favorites here. They are the grooving Gun For Hire and the rumbling Pleasure.  Some other songs I like are Soon as You're Ready, Calypso Girl, and Because of You. But Gun is still strong today with that superb horn section, the danceable rhythms and other aspects. I played that song over and over on the tape in 1988!  One of 1988's best albums to be released in at a time when 1987 songs and albums were number one hits in May, June and the summer of '88."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of the best RandB singers with a soft touch I really did like his music he had so many good songs I really did like Billy I still hear his music on the radio now he sings so well that you understand every word that he says I would truly recommend anoyone who likes Rand B music to definitely buy this album because it contains a lot of good songs from Billy . It contains: Love Zone, Loverboy, When The Going Gets Tough The Tough Gets Going, Caribbean Queen, Suddenly, Sad Songs, and many other good songs so therefore this is a very nice album I really do enjoy this album!!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Billy Ocean. Good old Billy Ocean! Yepp, this is how real pop music is supposed to sound like.It seems all his golden oldies have been included on this greatest hits album: \"When the going gets tough\", \"Loverboy\", \"Get out of my dreams\" and \"Carribean Queen\". And yes, \"License to chill\" is there, too. Plus some ballads, but I find them boring.It's a pity that this is a CD rather than a DVD, since the videoclips of this singer are extremely entertaining. I mean, one of them features Danny De Vito. Another shows Jabba the Hutt (!). Or was that Danny in disguise? Billy Ocean has always been a visual experience, not just your average pop singer. But sure, the music without the clips works just as well.Well, what more can I say?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Billy Ocean was one the most pleasant and emblematic figures of the pop movement between the early seventies. His repertoire was composed by easy to listen ballads and swinging pieces that were influence by the rhythm & soul. He is visibly influenced by Marvin Gaye, Lou Rawls and a little bit of Barry White. He was owner of a natural sympathy and unique charisma that so many successful moments gave us along his career.This compilation confirms why he was the figure he was. Don't miss this important album, part of the musical history."}

I just have to say kiler song BO,and i'll keep the stool warm for you, oh and I'll also save you a seat."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "From the middle 1970s through the next decade, Billy Ocean was a regular vistor to the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with his special brand of soulful pop. The melodic appeal of songs like Get Outta My Dreams, Caribbean Queen and Loverboy is still there and tracks like When The Going Gets Tough, Colour Of Love and There'll Be Sad Songs sound even better these days when the charts are filled with bland pop and boring rap. There's just one unforgivable omission here, the great song Red Light Spells Danger that was a huge hit for Ocean in the mid seventies. No collection could be considered complete without that masterpiece."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "By All Means Necessary gave us a taste of what was to come on this..it's like he lead us with baby steps to this. This album is a beast. It starts with a nice introduction by Kwame Ture (aka Stokely Carmichael), spoken in his characteristic soft and eloquent style and that leads right into the first track which starts out \"WAKE UP! TAKE THE PILLOW FROM YOUR HEAD, AND PUT A BOOK IN IT!\" That in itself should prove that this would be a different kind of album. This album pushed you to think, at the same time KRS was experimenting greatly with various lyrics flows at this time. The result is an absolute masterpiece o from a hip hop standpoint. I don't think this one got much radio play..but it wasn't created for that purpose.If I could..I'd buy everybody a copy of this. Seriously. We need to hear more music like this these days."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This came out in the midst of a lot of negativity in hip hop which has since overtaken the genre. KRS-One did a good job here in denouncing racism both inside and outside of the black community, dealing with issues of identity (the homeless and ya strugglin-note the subtle swipe at Michael Jackson in the latter) and an all-star jam with the BDP crew (D-nice, Miss Melody, Sister Harmony, etc). Some excerpts from Stokely Carmichael (yes, THAT Stoke-shortly before his death) are quite enlightening.Sadly, Kris Parker's hold on the youth did not last much longer as gangster (c)rap went on to destroy the music, but that's another story. Get this and see how rap COULD have been."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "With stripped down production, brilliant lyrics and the fiercest delivery of his career, KRS-One and company deliver the best LP in thier entire musical cannon. While many disliked and/or misunderstood this album when it first appeared, the last decade and a half have opened minds and ears to it's sheer daring and revolutionary impact. The music, as always is sliced down to the barest essentials, a simple 808 drum machine here, some reggae flavoring there (the hypnotic \"Breath Control II\") African Drums (\"The Homeless\") and even wah-wah guitar over funky drums (\"Original Lyrics\", my personal fave) and the production isn't too crowded allowing Parker's biting, incisive lyrics and terrific vocals plenty of breathing room and the attention they deserve. While things do get a bit preachy, the sheer enjoyment of these performances will leaven out the heavy-handed tone of the words. A rap LP was never more aptly titled. School is in session."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the one that put Buddy back on the blues map. With the help of several well-known friends, including Mark Knopfler, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton (who once called him the greatest live blues guitarist), and the great Memphis Horns, Buddy burns on the more uptempo tunes like the soulful groove of &quot;Where Is the Next One Coming From&quot; &amp; a definitive version of the classic &quot;Mustang Sally&quot;. Buddy's gritty, passionate vocals are intense without being totally over-the top, &amp; the background vocals are perfect. The slower tunes are not the old, tired, by-the-book standard slow blues, but are leisurely, rolling blues, focused as much on piano &amp; horns as on Buddy's guitar. He closes things out with &quot;Rememberin' Stevie&quot;, paying tribute to his own biggest fan."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Buddy Guy is one of the top blues guitar man.The others are Jimi Hendrix,Gary Moore,SRV... In my opinion,this cd is his best work.You must put this at cdplayer,and hear as loud as you can,so you'll be in tune with  one of the most energetic,consistent,emotional blues sets ever recorded.  Buddy's vocal tunes are sensually incendiary,with the combination of right  music choices,resulting this great album,with explosive interpretation of  Mustang Sally,and passionate in all other tracks. I really recomend this  'Dam'n right...',one of my best favorites in my collection"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Too Short outdid himself on Shorty the Pimp, which is arguably his best effort behind Get In Where You Fit In. Its what you would expect from Short, boasting of having women and making/having a lot of money. But he does take a serious approach on here with \"I Want To Be Free\" and \"So You Want To Be a Gangster\". The best track IMO is the surprising \"No Love From Oakland\". Throughout, Shorty the Pimp is infused with plenty of P-Funk samples, but then again what can you expect from classic Too Short."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have been listening to rap for a long time and no one can compete with Too $hort.  His Oaktown style is like no other.  When I listen to this record I am brought back to a certain time period inn a place the only Too $hort can emulate.  Too $hort brings classic raps of pimpin, slangin dope, and riding old school rides down the street.  It is the representation of an era that canont be reprodiced, the early 90's.  \"No Love From Oakland\" stands out showing the real Oaktown funky Ant Banks beats.  \"Something to Ride To\" features the Dangerous Crew and is one of my favorite tracks, with 11+ minutes of staight Oakland Ant Banks funkn beat, it just lets me smoke and ride on the city steets all day. COP IT IF U A PLAYER."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "so far, my fave tracks:1)Duck Down(sick,wicked drum beat.)2)Like a throttle(club banger. how could you not dance to this one ?)3)We In There- good loop.4)Build And Destroy- This song gives a black eye to The Poor Righteous Teachers AND X-Clan.(\"Too many teachers in the class spoil the school.After awhile you got blabberin' F***in fools.\")(\"What are you doing for yourself, Black Man,tryin' hard to be the original man? who?the first man with the first tan on the first land with the first clan?WHO GIVES A D*** ?!\")Sucker,Wack Or Booty M.C.'s Need NOT apply. Krs-One made that abundantly clear on this album.(\"I don't battle to win or lose i battle to ruin your whole career.\")old-school hip-hop with a message as well...what more can my ears ask for ? :D"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Its kind of hard to deny what Krs-One has brought to the game. His flow is phenomenal and the insight he gives is precious even now. Standout Tracks: DUCK DOWN, RUFF RUFF(dope match up with Freddie Foxx), 13 AND GOOD(the story of a guy who sleeps with a teen that calls her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitches), POISONOUS PRODUCTS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, LIKE A THROTTLE, WE IN HERE, THE REAL HOLY PLACE(the deepest track on here), WHO ARE THE PIMPS? and the reggae tinged joints like SAY GAL and SEX AND VIOLENCE are gems also. Filler: NONE! Bottom Line: BDP's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day. Besides the slammin production, Krs showed that he was 100 steps ahead from the average rapper with this album. Any born again hip hop head would do well to start off with Edutainment and work their way down to this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "UGK&#65533;s first album is an undisputed Dirty South classic.  This duo, hailing from Texas, was one of the first dirty south groups that were not bass music to put it down (along with Geto Boys & Eightball & MJG).  UGK&#65533;s debut album is beyond great.  The samples used in the songs are not disgraceful and UGK are notorious for sampling on their earlier albums.  The rapping, compared to their skills now, is a little lacking but they were in their developmental stages during this album.  Still, they drop memorable lines and classic verses all throughout this album.  The best songs include but are not limited to &#65533;Something Good&#65533;, &#65533;Use Me Up&#65533;, and  &#65533;Cramping My Style&#65533;.  This album is a must have for all fans of UGK and of Dirty South music.  5 Star classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the first main stream cd that they dropped and today it's still one of the hardest. When I first heard 976 Bun B in 93 I was like this can't be real. I had never heard anyone flow like this cat before and his style has only gotten stronger. Bun B and Pimp C are the duo way before Outkast and all the other greats to follow. The thing is they just kept getting better with time. If you haven't heard this you are missing out. And the next up Ridin Dirty is a must have as well. I wish I could get the tape samle to this cd that they released. Tell Me Something Good had different words to it than what's on the cd and 976 Bun B had a different beat. Both were a lot harder I tell you. I wish I could find out who stole it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album was haaard. The production is classic. Every song from the start to finish has tight rhymes. Spices flow was much more advanced from his first album which is a classic too. I can't sat how much I like this CD. I like what ant banks did with the 'george duke' sample on 'clip & tha trigga' too, since I used to like the original. This is essential if you want good westcoast rap. Also checkout South central cartels 'N' gatz we truss' if you like this. Peace!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Boogie Down Productions leader KRS-One's reputation began to slip in the early '90s, as he spent more time educating than performing. He hit back at his critics with the slamming Return of the Boom Bap, his first official solo release. Leaving behind the detailed production of the last BDP album Sex and Violence, Boom Bap returns the MC to the spare, gritty territory of Criminal Minded. KRS-One sounds reinvigorated, as well, spitting out his rhymes with fury and intelligence. Although the record isn't as didatic as Edutainment or Sex and Violence, KRS-One hasn't made his lyrics simplistic, nor has he abandoned his cutting, intelligent social commentary. The combination of hard, basic beats and exciting rhymes makes Rerturn of the Boom Bap a genuine comeback for KRS-One, one of the founding figures of modern hip-hop."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "overall, this is a pretty good album with a few outstanding cuts. \"Outta Here\", \"I Can't Wake Up\", and \"Mortal Thought\" are all fairly entertaining tracks that showcase KRS-One's gifted delivery and his creative flow. but the production of this record sounds dated and alot of the songs toward the end of the record are forgettable. i prefer the hardcore leanings of his BDP days rather than these semi-concious psuedo-ragga party jams. but KRS's voice is still a treat to listen to and this record is probably better than almost any other hip hop album put out in 1993."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have been a krs-one fan for a LONG time, and would have to say this is his best album.  Sound Of Da Police is completely off the hook, the lyrics are some of the best you'll come across.  Krs is one of the greatest rappers ever, and this album is a timeless underground classic.  This is REAL hip-hop, dont support what we hear on the radio these days, its all crap, listen to legends like krs-one and rakim.  Other good tracks are KRS-One Attacks and Return Of Da Boombap.Beats - 10/10Lyrics - 10/10Production - 10/10Originality - 10/10Final Note - 5 Mic Classic, one that all true rap/hip-hop fans have.  Classic album, one of the best of our time."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Criminal minded, by any means, return of the boom bap, krs one (self titled) are the best albums he ever did and made him the legend he is. On this particular album he displays his true lyricism such as metaphors,battle rap etc. This is definately far entertaining then previous releases such as sex and violence, edutainment, and ghetto music, those albums came off to preachy in my opinion and don't standout amongst his better efforts as I mentioned before. You can play the whole thing through, although in my opinion the only track I would skip is \"uh oh\" because it's a beatbox beat which get's annoying after awhile other then that this is a classic album in hip hop and a landmark in it's history."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Krs-One returned with a vengeance in 93, and dropped a CLASSIC in the form of Return Of The Boom Bap. This album, like every other Krs-One album, represents him in his truest form, always talking about something positive, claiming to be &quot;the teacher&quot; of hip hop, and saying things to leave you thinking. Here's the review:Album Highlights: Krs-One Attacks, Outta Here, Black Cop, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound Of Da Police, Mad Crew, and Return Of The Boom Bap.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: While NOT as strong as Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary, this is still Krs at his best. Today, he still remains one of the most influential MCs out there keeping his legacy alive. Overall, I recommend you pick up this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is some str8 killa from the Kingz...Bun B and Pimp C Def. Show some real talent & ability on this record....easily up there w/\"Ridin' Dirty\" & \"Too Hard to Swallow\".  These guys have some of the tightest beats and rhymes out there...10 years+ later, it's still better than most s*** out there.  My Fav tracks are \"I left it Wet for ya\", \"Underground\", \"Feds in Town\", \"It's Supposed to Bubble\",....they're all tight..Super tight...check this one out!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Pimp C and Bun B came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire.  This album slams from start to finish with that old school down south feel.  The beats are melodic G-Funk, with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs.  Lyrically and vocally, UGK kills in all departments.  They really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows. The track \"Feds in Town\" is a gangster classic with a phat, funky beat and tight scratches. \"Super Tight...\" is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue. The mid 90's was one of the best periods in rap history, and this album is testament to it.  Don't sleep on this classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Too $hort is the biggest pimp ever and always will be. Even though he doesn't rap about much else, for some reason it never gets old listening to Short dog. Possibly because Ant Banks provides some of the funkiest beats, or maybe it's Too $hort's delivery and voice, but I will never get tired of listening to Too $hort. This album is his best, edging out Life is Too Short and Cocktails. It has the best production and Too $hort and company drop hot lyrics over the beats. Bay Area rap doesn't get much better."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Don't be too mad at me, but I really just discovered 12 Play about a few weeks ago.  I've really been 'into' music the past few years.  I feel its important to go back and listen to the 'real' music.  This cd has always been in my house, but never listened to it.  I mean who doesn't kno Bump and Grind, Your Body's Callin, It Seems Like you ready.  But to me those aren't the only good ones on the cd.  I love the uptempo jams like HOMIE LOVER FRIEND, FREAK DAT BODY, my fave uptempo being SUMMER BUNNIES! It just screams old summer jam!  But besides the obvious the good songs all the releases SEX ME AND 12 PLAY are just so damn good.  There has never been an r&b cd since this and it's a tough act to follow."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Do you mind if I give you some of my........12 play?What else can I say about the king? This album is a true RnB classic. I listen to this album and I hear the passion in his voice, the seduction in the production and........the bad rapping! But when its the 'R' you can forgive him for a few blunders (i.e. \"I like the crotch on you\" and \"Back to the hood of things\" ugh!) Nevertheless, this album is pure brilliance. Love him or like him he just may be the greatest RnB artist of all time!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Just a classic CD on this one. Wow, from start to finish, this album is just loaded with tracks from &quot;Your Body's Callin'&quot; to &quot;12-Play&quot;. My favorite track is &quot;Seems Like Your Ready&quot;, a slept on classic song. To me this is where R. Kelly starts production spree of songs from Hi-Five's &quot;Quality Time&quot; on. Of course, the two stand out songs with the remixes for &quot;Bump &amp; Grind&quot; &amp; Your Body's Callin'&quot;. So please get this one because it is a definite can't miss."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Well, I liked this CD a lot. someone that I didn't know purchased it for me off of my wishlist (you can buy me something for me, too if you like!). And when I got it, I listened to it all the way through. I've been an Aaliyah fan since &quot;Back and Forth,&quot; and I'd heard some songs on this album, but not the whole thing, so this was really a treat for me. I liked the CD, and the beats, it really DID have &quot;a 90s swing.&quot; the only thing I didn't like was R. Kelly all over it. I've always disliked R. Kelly, and I think that the best ONLY thing he ever did was Aaliyah. The album, though, and the content was really immature, which wasn't rare for albums that came out in the 1994 period, but I still liked it. It was pretty good. But my favorite is still &quot;Back and Forth.&quot; :D"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Aaliyah came out when she was 15 and had some great hip hop laced R&B; cuts with help from R. Kelly, her mentor and rumored husband.Aaliyah had a certain charisma and smooth delivery that made up for her sometimes immature lyrics (which was not her fault). Still this Cd was very important in the mid 90's. Age Ain't Nothing But a Number, Back and Forth, and At your best (You are love) were her singles but I was also impressed by her other cuts.This Cd is straight 90's music but it is Aaliyah and it is still a classic!Favs: Street Thing, Im so into you, No one Knows.., Old School, along with her singles!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a dope album by a very young and under rated e-40. I brought this in 97 and took a chance buying it because I never heard it. im a big e-40 fan and i have of his other cds but this one got by me. The song federal is super tight that will break your speakers.This cd is great but not as good as the mail man which came after this. But this is a must has if your a e-40 fan cause it has great those old  cali mob style beats."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A lot of you think this is there first national record to rise to stardom but in actualality N2DEEP Back to the hotel put E-40 and B-legit to the gold record artist status that they were bound to achieve.this record  didn't achieve that status but more than should've.if your someone who is a  pure click fan the song V-town on back to the hotel is one to get.When this  record was first released independently samples weren't cleared and when  jive picked it up they chose not to clear them and took them of the record.  bad decision.they have sold around 400,000 copies of this yet this a bay  classic. It still will most likely go gold but it would make it there  faster if they would bring back the original album.These 4 artists have  tried to hold down the westcoast while the rest of the west has been and  stayed on vacation.If you don't have this record get it but if possible hit  a store that has the original copy not the edited version."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is easily E-40's best work. &quot;In a Major Way&quot; is top-notch material from beginning to end. The beats provide classic West Coast g-funk, while 40's flows and linguistics are solid as usual.Nearly every track is equal in calibur, but the 3 stand-outs would probably be the classic &quot;Dusted &amp; Disgusted,&quot; &quot;1-Luv,&quot; and &quot;Spittin.&quot;There's not one weak track on here. If you're into the West Coast sound, and even if you're not, this is an album you should definitely have in your collection.The West could use another album of this calibur these days."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In a Major way is E-40's best album, a Bay Area classic. The Vallejo Boss Playa just blew up on this amazing album. Features the unmatchable beats by Mike Mosley &amp; Sam Bostic, Funk Daddy and Studio Ton. The album is  perfect from start to end and it's got the two classic cuts : Sprinkle Me  (feat. Suga T) and the one and only Dusted 'n' Disgusted, which has one of  the TIGHTEST beats I've ever heard, combined with BREATHTAKING verses by  the greatest rappers - SPICE 1, 2PAC, MAC MALL AND 40 WATER! The album also  features 40's long time partner B-Legit and also Mac Shawn, Levitti and  Celly Cel. This album takes the Sick Wid It Mob sound to a whole new level  and E-40 continues to develop his own unique style, inventing new slang and  always comming with fresh delivery."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Umm... What shall I say 'bout this one? It's pretty easy, if you like westcoast rap you gon' love this one! E-40's best all around and probarly one of Bay Area's finest, up there together with Mac Mall's Illegal Business?.E-40 never dissapoints me and after dropping so many albums, he still hasn't got the props he deserves.The whole Bay Area is painfully underated.Mac Mall, Spice 1, E-40 and his Sick-Wid-It records click and Ray Luv, these are my favorites outta Bay Area.Buy anything by them and show love, 'cause it basically don't get pretty much better than this type of Westcoast rap.One word for this record : Classic.I don't even have to mention highlights 'cause they're all great, but my favorite probarly is Dusten 'N' Disgusted featuring 2Pac, Spice 1 and Mac Mall.Get this one, it will make you money worth, no doubt."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Critics trashed this album when it came out.  Too polished, overproduced, not like down and dirty.........blah blah blah.This is a great album that showcases their growth and success.  Everybody really does a good job on this album.  This second album has more great songs than their third Album &quot;money and muscle, and better performances, and more mature than Down and Dirty.  Definite satisfaction.Take the down and dirty album and add about million dollars worth of production value and you get this album.  The group probably won't make a fourth album so this is the one everyone will remember."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The Click have been under-rated and overlooked for years, and probably always will be.  Despite that, they've managed to put out better sh** than 90% of rappers out there.  \"Game Related\" is a must have for any west coast fan, and any rap fan in general should at least check it out.

The drug slang hit &quot;Hurricane&quot; and the ZAPP sampled &quot;Scandalous&quot;  were the hit singles and are definitely the catchy hits.E-40 and B-LEGIT work the drunken craze of the funky &quot;Out my body&quot;.

Dainja\" and \"MC's Act Like They Don't Know\" was are great East Coast hip-hop feel displaying Krs' lyricisim.  \"Ah-Yeah\" displays his consciousness of scociety's problems.  As automatic as his flow on \"De Automatic\"  featuring Fat Joe.  \"...stack some money for a video, I don't have any. You're looking at the last emcee with true talent...\" he put it into perspective with \"Build Ya Skillz\".  This release is a presentation of plain hip-hop.  Nothing commercial just \"R.E.A.L.I.T.Y.\" through the eyes of Bronx own Krs-One."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am a fan from the BDP days of KRS.His self titled release here was a bit slept on at the time.I think Boom Bap was just so cool and groundbreaking that when this came on people wanted more of that sound.Now that nearly 10 years have passed this album stands up very well.Especially with this Blinged out era its almost like crawling into a time capsule.The hottest joint Mc's Act Like They Don't Know could put any rhyme out there today on its back by itself.Thats not even the hardest cut on a emcee basis.Check out Build Ya Skills with Busta Rhymes, thats some whoop ass for ya.DJ Premier probably did some of his finest work on this album.KRS also blended his productions nicely too.If you are KRS fan this can't dissapoint."}

Dope production tactics by DJ Premier, Diamond D, and cameos by Fat Joe,  Busta Rhymes, and a who's who of hip-hop personalities!One of 1995's  best albums, but still slept on!!  Go buy this record!"}

This CD from top to bottom is just dope with &quot;Round 2 Intro&quot;. K-Lou does most of the production on this CD which makes this CD an instant g-funk classic. Some of the other tracks that just brings this CD to the forefront is &quot;Killa Kali&quot; & &quot;Skanless A** B******&quot;, & &quot;Funk Season&quot;. So go ahead and order your copy if you love g-funk."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Celly Cel really does his thug thang on this album!  He throws in his complex, loud, and often fast flow over tight G-Funk beats.  A standout track is \"What U N----z Thought.\" The song is laced with some of the hardest beats and rhymes in gangsta rap.  A menacing foreground beat with a Dr Dre'ish whiny keyboard synth in the background.  He sounds really angry and crazy on that song.  \"It's Goin Down\" is a lot slower.  It has a nice slow jam beat with the occasional faint use of a talk box reciting: \"It's goin down\" during the hook.  Throughout the album, he shows the harder side of California life!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "With his thrid CD in three years, R.Kelly delivered more of his usual antics. While this CD had it's moments it also had it's share of weak moments. The strong moments were the ballads which he's always known for. The first trio of ballads the hit single You Remind Me Of Something, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby and my personal favorite Step In My Room show R's vocals and writing at it's best. The next two strong ballads Down Low (Nobody Has To Know) and \"I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)\" were also good , although the remixes were better. The other strong ballads  Tempo Slow was placed at towards the end of the CD but it was placed in the middle of R. Kelly's religous section of the CD."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Very few albums out at the moment are so good that you can listen to it from start to finish. Although this is far more mellow and laid-back than just about all of Kelly's other albums, the consistant quality of the songs make this a treat to the ears.Kelly has said that it was around this time that he discovered God. God really must have inspired him, as it is far greater than his previous work (although 12 Play is a classic).Just about the best ballad Kelly ever wrote (&quot;I Can't Sleep Baby (If I) is probably the best song on the album, followed closely by the mid tempo &quot;Thank God It's Friday&quot;. The multi-octave style of Marvin Gaye can be seen used here. It is a pity Kelly doesn't use it anymore.If you are just getting into his work and are not going for the more hardcore elements of &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;, get this album as it will really open the door to what tis guy is trying to say."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Before Mystikal became mundane he was putting out southern rap classics like this album. When you listen to Y'all Aint Ready Yet and Here I Go you can tell that Mystikal put effort into his raps and wasnt going through the motions like he does now. Out That Boot Camp Clicc remains as one of my favorite tracks from Mystikal. As for flaws, there are none. This album was Mystikal at his best. I really think he messed up when he decided to go commercial and put out lackluster material(four albums later). Bottom Line: Mind Of Mystikal is one of the best releases in 1995 and is Mystikal's best album. The production was cool and Mystikal was hungry as hell back then. Standout Tracks: YALL AINT READY YET(original and remix), MURDERER, BEWARE, I'M, HERE I GO, OUT THAT BOOT CAMP CLICC, MIND OF MYSTIKAL, NOT THAT N****, NEVER GONE BOUNCE(The Dream)."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Exactly 14 years on this day records stores across the country put a CD on the shelf that changed and set the tone for hip hop and music in general if you ask me.  Ridin' Dirty was that album.  Years previous before this album dropped, I argued that The Chronic was the best album front to back until this one dropped.  Not to take anything from The Chronic, but this one split it's fair share of speakers.  Pimp C himself said something to the effect that he wanted to make an album on that level and be in the zone Dr. Dre was in.I can damn near rap to this whole cd but the tracks that stand out the most to me is the following:MurderDiamonds & Wood3 in the Mornin'TouchedThat's Why I CarryHi LifeOutroSo what I plan on doing is playing this one off and on throughout this weekend as I ride through this city called Houston and pay homage to 2 of my favorite rappers; Pimp C (RIP) and Bun B."}

The blond haired kid hit piercingly high notes. I was completely baffled by this as I sat back and ate my cream corn and mini corn dogs. So I bought the cassette tape. Then the ladies were all talking to me. They were like, \"Hey Chad, can I listen to the B-Boys on your headphones?\" And I was like \"Ah yeah baby, come over here and sit on my lap, and we can listen to the sweat sounds of the B-Boys together.\" He he he he he. Backstreet's back, alright!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The Backstreet Boys became highly admired dominantly by young girls just like New Kids On The Block in the late 80's and early 90's. In 1997 when this album was released,it sold by the dozens just like Hanson's MIDDLE OF NOWHERE album. Hit songs include EVERYBODY(Backstreet's Back)*,QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEART,I'LL NEVER BREAK YOUR HEART,ALL I HAVE TO GIVE and AS LONG AS YOU LOVE ME,all later recycled for 2001's THE HITS-CHAPTER ONE. SET ADRIFT ON MEMORY BLISS contains music excerpts for Spandau Ballet's TRUE. Personally,this album,like every other BSB album,I believe is one of the greatest ever recorded. It continued to sell well throughout 1998. *How could that be? They just started."}

Although BSB is adored by millions of pre-teen girls, you shouldn't totally dismiss this album.  However, this is their first album and they have gotten much better over the years.  I never understood how this music is considered &quot;pop&quot; when all it is R&amp;B.  But that's all a part of a critic's job- to neatly place everyone in a particular musical category."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "This was the best hip hop album i've ever heard and what makes me mad is that the legendary Krs didn't get noticed because of his looks, but his lyrical talent is what should be noticed bacause by far he remains the greatest lyrical rapper ever, and some other great lyrical rappers who don't get noticed that much like Keith Murray, Mos Def, Skee Lo and Dead Prez should because they are the revolutions of hip hop, and if the game is interested in looks more than talent, then hip hop is dead. But nontheless, this is the man that inspired many known rappers today, including LL Cool J, Jay Z, Nas, Twista, Public Enemy etc and in my point of view is the greatest rapper alive. So if you like hip hop, Krs One, fresh tracks and collaberations, this album has it all, the legendary Krs One will forever remain the greatest lyrical rapper in the world, no one can reach his level."}

I like trick, but damn, Better Dayz was...well, the only good tracks were the Outlawz tracks!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I read some review where people said it was rushed. Tupac wrote these songs before he died. These songs were never altered, sold, poluted, or reprised by any other producer/artist. Eminem never got a chance to add his voice or 50 cent's to a song or album. I believed it was somewhat of a cry from the grave, or in a sense final words to poets and fans alike, who could benifet from his wisdom. This album is not be appreciated for its abilty to entertain a club or crowd. And not all rap albums arent supposed to. I believe this album to be the true voice of Tupac after his grave. It is familier of his \"Me Against the World\" album. I urger anyone who is looking for a cd to bump in their car, play at a party or while cleaning their house TO NOT BUY THUS ALBUM, But anyone who wants to know what Tupacs real future for his music to do so! Please lets not poision his legacy lets uphold it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "RU Still Down first posthumus 2pac album is my favorite one created after he died. Pacs vocals are not sped up and the production sounds like a 2pac album. I could list this whole album as the best songs but the standouts to me are RU Still Down, Hellrazor, Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto hip hop version, Open Fire, When I Get Free 1 and 2, Do For Love, F=== All Yall, well just forget it. Every song on here is a standout in my eyes. Pac's albums would go downhill from here."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Finally Tupac Shakur has came down from cloud 9, only this has happened after Tupac Shakur has actually visited cloud 9 (Heaven).  This double LP sounds more like a compilation of 2Pac's early work, most tracks were made around the times of \"2Pacalypse Now\" and \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\", and it shows.  Although Tupac (as always) comes with it lyrically (for the most part), this album - like his old albums, suffers from poor production.  But this LP is still a solid buy, it is just below average overall as an LP.  Records like \"Do 4 Me\" and \"I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto (remix)\", alone are an overwhleming excuse to buy this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the first anti-flag album and I didnt like it at first, but it quickly grew on me. This album is less accessable than their current work, but still great. Anti-flag are your classic anti authoritarian, anti patriotism, etc, punk band. Their main influences being the sex pistols and the uk subs, they create brilliant album. The highlight here is really the title track, you've got to die for your government, which is an ironic attack on the government, reminiscent of the sex pistols' God save the queen and the dead kennedys' kill the poor, among others. I know a lot of people dont like them, because they are getting really popular, but so what, just because most of their audience are posers, doesnt make the message any less valid, or the music any less great. And to all those patriotic idiots, LOL, maybe one day you'll wake up. Probably not, though."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A very pleasant album, immaculately produced, perhaps a masterpiece of British folk. The songs are nice and pleasing, very pleasant to listen to: relaxing. Drake's delicate acoustic guitar work is fine and suits the songs perfectly, augmented by fine string and wind arrangements (though they can be slightly overbearing at times), and bright splashes of piano. Drake's own lyrics are beautiful examples of understated emotional poetry. His vocals are distinctive, very English, and a good medium for communicating this poetry, especially with this musical backing. It's a nice package. Certainly a hallmark recording for anyone interested in British folk."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I was lucky enough to hear to original LP when I was younger as my father was a huge fan of the ever thoughtful and often melancholy genius of Drake. There's nothing I can add that hasn't already been said with one exception. The re-master of this album is showing its colors in that there is a noticeable gain hiss from the original session tapes. This may have been a problem to deal with in the late 90's when this was re-mastered and re-issued. But with todays \"de-hiss\" technology, it effectively eliminates this slight noise that blankets the entire album. They really should reconsider re-re-mastering this album, again, from the original tapes, and not from this master to make this a completely perfect album in both execution and final CD (or DVD Audio) pressed result."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "My favourite tracks on this debut album are those with a fuller instrumentation, i.e. Time Has Told Me with its beautiful electric guitar, piano and bass; Way To Blue with its melancholy mood elegantly expressed in a complex melody and sensitive string arrangement, and; Cello Song, a hypnotic love song with a magical interplay of cello, bass and congas. I also like The Thoughts Of Mary Jane and Three Hours, a brooding little number. As with all Drake's work, the overall mood is one of sadness wrapped in dreamy melodies, where the poetic lyrics take the listener to far-away places."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "To actually access the music of Nick Drake, you have to get past a lot of baggage: the biographical legend; the twee aesthetic, aptly signified by the blandly psychedelic cover, fey title and spelling; the voice, an adolescent-whisper-falsetto type thing when it's not trying to be Bob Dylan.  Once you do get past all that, the album is a vaguely pleasant, if indistinguishable, wash of folk pop, with unexpected instruments - cello, piano, harpsichord, sax etc. - keeping things interesting (some of the songs sound like an earnest Divine Comedy).  There is one stand-out track, however, 'Poor Boy', part-Jobim samba, part-Legrand French cafe pop, part-Stones gospel.  Its pop melancholy suggests where Drake's true talents lay."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The closest thing to a mainstream album that Nick ever recorded. There's even a near-rocker (\"Hazy Janey II\"), albeit one in Nick's usual somber style. I actually don't think this is nearly as good as the previous record or the next one: a bunch of weak instrumentals (title track; \"Sunday\"; \"Fly\"), and \"Poor Boy\" is the closest to overproduced Drake gets. Regardless, there are several fantastic songs: \"Hazy Janey II\" and its psychedelic-folk counterpart, \"Hazy Janey I\"; \"At the Chime of a City Clock\", which is some good jazzy stuff; \"One of Those Things First\" is charming but slightly rambling; and \"Northern Sky\" is one of the most resonant pieces in Drake's catalogue, which is saying something. So it's slightly uneven, but the best songs make it very worthwhile."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Definitely Nick Drake's most mainstream release in his all too brief discography, Bryter Layter is filled with more somber guitar lines, Nick's expressive vocals, and even drums/flutes/other instruments! Wow!Those elements are a turn off for those who like more of his raw and unpolished music, but a lot of the songs on this album are just as emotional as those on Pink Moon or 5 Leaves Left, though some of the songs can do without the overproduction.Still worthy of a listen, and of a purchase."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Nick Drake's second album, Bryter Layter, is the &quot;lightest&quot; sounding of the three he released during his lifetime.  While not happy by any means, there is a breezy sound that flows throughout the album that adds a lighter touch to such brooding tracks as &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Poor Boy&quot; and the two &quot;Hazy Jane&quot; songs.  The standout track on the album is the incredible &quot;At The Chime Of A City Clock&quot; which digs at the depths of the man and he confessionally lays his thoughts on the table.  Another striking album from the troubled yet talented singer."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "i think this could be his best album- i think the best tracks on the first album might be better than the best ones here- but overall bryter layter is probably the better of the two. i defy anyone, and i mean anyone, in rock n' roll today to write something as perfect and as beautiful as, say, fly or at the chime of a city clock. drake's voice and guitar work, as well as the beautiful orchestrations of robert kirby and guest appearances by john cale and fairport convention members, among others make this a lush and truly incredible album, nearly every track is a classic. this timeless album is like all of drake's catalogue-essential. he just may be the best post dylan singer songwriter , and certainly until recently an underrated and unsung figure ."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Hearing Nick Drake for the first time was quite a revelation.  The guitar playing was so intriguing and...different.  And his voice really caught my attention.  This disc is awesome-I would say as perfect as an acoustic folk album can be.  &quot;Place to be&quot; and &quot;Which will&quot; are especially powerful.  No frills on this disc, just a man and a guitar.  There is an atmosphere of sadness that pervades this disc, it's great to put on when you have a lot on your mind.  It helps me slow down.  Essential."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "There are three eseential Nick Drake albums:Five Leaves Leftwith its chamber folk,Bryter Layterwith its huge arrangements. and Pink Moon.Pink Moon is bassically Drake on solo accustic guitar. But Drake was no strummer. His complex composing and full guitar playing--he could strum, pick, and almost orchestrate with a simple accustic--make these full songs, rich in sound like jazz classical minitures.The sad Drake alone is a whisful, poiniant experiance, and listening to the beatiful music on Pink Moon is a trip like few others--queiting and disquieting, sad and comforting.Essential"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Pink Moon is the one of the most revealing folk/singer-songwriter records out there..which is odd, because the lyrics are impenetrably nonsensical. I think the reason Pink Moon is such an emotionally stirring record are Drake's melodies and the intimate recording style; as well, the strange guitar tunings provide the mystique necessary to buffer the lyrics' surrealist imagery. The magic of this album is in it's less-is-more approach that conveys Drake's mental state at the time. A fitting elegy for one of folk-rock's most talented, and troubled, songwriters."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Have you seen that Volkswagon commercial where those college looking co-eds look like their going on a road trip at night, and then lay on the roof of their car and look up at the stars. Well if you have, you probably did , or didn't now that Nick Drake's 'Pink Moon' was playing in the background. 'Pink Moon' was Drake's last album; originally forgotten by  mainstream music fans, is now a testament to what a true artist is.You could listen to this recording 1000 times in a row and not get tired of it, and probably hear something different everytime. The album itself is a melancholy, moody, sort of naive triumph.Although Drake's premature death of an overdose of antidepressants took down a genius in his prime, we still have his great recordings; such as 'Pink Moon', and just wonder, what if."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I thought with all the new found attention the song is getting (due to the very nice VW commercial) I'd add this to my reviews.This is a classic collection of short, soft-folk driven music with amazing guitars and lyrics  to die for. It's certainly is nice to see everyone finding out about his  music...finally. Artists like Belle and Sebastian certainly have Nick to  thank for their own style here in the new century. Like Ian Curtis after  him, Nick was a genius for the ages. He was a more dark artistic type a  songwriter, one who was simply a special unique voice way before his time  or ours.please feel free to check out my other reviews."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "One of the greatest folk records out there. Not much else needs to be said. We lost a genius to an overdose. Not really appreciated in his time but this record will stand forever as long as it is available to listen to. The stark and fluid guitar work is contrasted with a voice so soothing, so troubled, and so damning of the culture around it. I can't really say much more. This record is an outstanding piece from one of our greatest musicians. The remastered tracks sound every bit as good as they should. Perfection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Never has music this beautiful been made. This is a precise peice of art, and you only wish he had made 20 or so albums. IT is very bare and to the point, but it is also inspiring. On a warm Fall day, or a cool night, put this on and sit back and relax, and let the music flow over you. It's pretty amazing, and i don't know why anyone would deny that. Hope no one does. Beck's \"Sea Change,\" and THe Sundays must have been made with this album in mind. So if you like them you'll love this, or vice versa. Besides the first song it is just Nick Drake and his guitar in a very stripped down personal setting, that sounds so fresh it feels like he's in the room. If it is possible to cry over an album of music then this is the one you'll be crying over. IT is that beautiful."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Being a big fan of Iron & Wine, Sufjan, Joshua Radin, Elliott Smith, and Damien Rice, I thought I would try out this CD (also bought \"Five Leaves Left\"), as he seems to be an original...and I was impressed.  Nick's guitar work is very solid, his lyrics poignant, his voice mellow, and his songs strong.  The CD whips through quickly with its short songs (too short!), and I could definitely hear his influence in the modern day singers I mentioned above.  Although I prefer the modern singers, this CD definitely will work its way into my rotation.  I definitely recommend this album for those that enjoy this type of music...if you prefer Iron & Wine over Blackeyed Peas, or Sufjan over Timberlake, or Radin, Elliott, and Rice over Maroon 5, then you must buy this CD.  But do like I did...wait until Amazon puts it for sale under $10.00."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Of all the places to discover Nick Drake, I had to discover him in, yes, the Volkswagen commercial.  Despite this method of discovery, I am thrilled to have been able to discover Drake. His music can be dark and moody, but it is always beautiful, and always original. His lyrics, though sometimes non-sensical, fit the music well. They are mysterious and cryptic. The songs on &quot;Pink Moon&quot; are unforgettable. There is the bluesy &quot;Know,&quot; the elegant &quot;From the Morning,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Horn.&quot; Horn is a sparce instrumental track. Drake creates an atmosphere with this song that I have yet to see paralleled. My only quam with this album is that it is over far too quickly. With each listen, I am left wanting another half hour of music. Despite this shortcoming, I would classify this album as a true &quot;classic&quot; and would recommend it to music fans everywhere."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Pink Moon will always hold a special place in my heart. Not only was this my first introduction to the Artist. But was also my first CD exchange with a dear friend. The ramifications of emotions and memories this album brings are at times overwhelming.This Album embodies all I ever wanted to achieve, and all that I have.In the most simple definition Pink Moon represents the true shape of music. Music in its purest form and most beautiful shade.Recorded over two nights in October 1971. Nobody knew he was making an album. He turned in the master tapes and proclaimed \"I have no more songs left to sing\".This is just a man and his guitar. No more, no less. This is not about making a statement, creating greatness, or re-designing the laws of music. But merely an expression. And that is what music should be.Is so easy to indulge ourselves with production details and ideals. That we forget what true music should be."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Apparently, a lot of modern young musicians have looked to Nick Drake for inspiration. That sense of despair, that sense of loneliness, irrelevance, that kind of thing... Maybe that's one reason why they walk around like tramps, loud-mouthed and stupid. The search for individuality has surely drifted into the hands of ignorant swine.By Pink Moon stage, Nick Drake had drifted into isolation and heavy depression. But the sound of Pink Moon is not crushingly depressing nor is it tediously claustrophobic.The album has an overall quality of sound. Some bits are higher tempo and, so, more uplifting. The instrument playing is precise, like Drake's voice, carrying the listener over desolate hills and stillwater beaches. I can't really pick out the highlights because it's like taking the chicks away from the mother hen.Pink Moon is worth more than a listen. It deserves to be thought of as a beautiful, melancholic, classic on anybody's list."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is just guitar and voice with a smattering of piano here and there. It contains classics like \"Radio\", \"Which Will\" and the well-known title track. \"Know\" is almost bluesy with its simple guitar and haunting voice, while the jangling guitar of \"Parasite\" has an almost hypnotic quality. \"Ride\" has a lovely pop melody and has been covered by other artists, I think. \"From The Morning\" is another pastoral gem. Although delectable in its minimalist elegance, Pink Moon is not my favourite Nick Drake album. I just enjoy his voice more with a fuller instrumental backing. Still, this remains a minimalist classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Nick Drake's final album, Pink Moon, was recorded over the span of two days.  Unlike his first two albums, which contained backing of strings, woodwinds and keyboards, Pink Moon is stripped down to bone.  Mr. Drake's expressive guitar takes center stage and the bleak arrangements feed the depressive lyrics.  The title has become famous thanks to its inclusion in a Volkswagon, but it is only one of many stellar tracks.  &quot;Things Behind The Sun&quot;, &quot;From The Morning&quot;, &quot;Road&quot;, &quot;Harvest Breed&quot; and &quot;Rise&quot; all contain dark, brooding, deep and thought provoking lyrics that show a man with clear inner demons."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought a Nick Drake album once before &amp; was really disappointed by the arrangements.  Lots of strings... couldn't really listen to it.  Then I picked up Pink Moon.  WOW!  This is what all the fuss is about.  Unique, acoustic, mellow &amp; beautiful.  If you are at all interested in Nick Drake get Pink Moon first &amp; you'll be hooked.  This is a great album &amp; I've got to admit that it was that VW add that made me give Nick Drake another shot... really a mellow classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "yes, this is a sad and eerie record . i must admit that i prefer the first two nick drake albums, but this is a fine album in its own right. my favorite songs are things behind the sun and parasite. know is also excellent, a weird  little blues cut with ominous and powerful strumming by drake and  a few deceptively simple words. a majestic and rather creepy release from perhaps the greatest of the late 60's early 70s singer songwriters. and as always, his voice, arrangements and words are eerie,haunting ,and touching. highly recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album had such a reputation that I could not miss it. What I must say, this is not for people who enjoy bubblegum hummable top 40 tunes; or most other people I'm sad to say. The songs are tuneless, melancholic droning without any distinct structure. Pink Moon is the only redeemable track. Nick Drake the 'tortured' genius the legend has become intertwine with his music so that its not his talent alone, but the sad story of his premature death which has carried this decidedly mediocre record.If you're into depressing music then Elliott Smith offers much more listenable fare. At least his songs have beautiful melody, harmonies, instrumentals.etc."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Pink Moon, Nick Drake's final album before his unfortunate death, is a masterpiece. Recorded during midnight sessions on consecutive nights, Nick Drake sat in a studio with himself and producer Joe Boyd. The only thing that accompanies Drake's voice is the silent playing of his acoustic guitar (and piano on the title track, Pink Moon.) As Drake plunged deeper into depression, he expressed himself by recording the bleak Pink Moon, which stands today as one of the most underrated albums by one of the most underrated singer-songwirters in history. Recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "i had this review completely written when my power went out a few hours ago. and you know how frustrating it is to try to write something over by memory, so i won't. basically, i was disappointed by this album because i love self and was expecting their debut to sound really fresh and exciting and creative, but it's frankly not as good as their &quot;breakthrough&quot; album--if it can be called such--breakfast with girls. and of course, nothing tops their recorded-using-only-toy-instruments off-the-wall masterpiece gizmodgery, which everyone in the world should own (i recently sold my copy for 27 bucks at half.com...it's out of print, and i'm counting on it being rereleased relatively soon). anyway, subliminal plastic motives sounds like a fifth album, tired, uninspired, and while self had definitely already established the roots of their unique electropop sound, it wouldn't achieve ultimate fruition until the 2nd or 3rd album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Though it was his second studio album, it contains so many classics that it could be called a greatest hits album.  &quot;Radio Radio,&quot; &quot;This Year's Girl,&quot; &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea&quot; were some of the top songs of the new wave.  They sound just as full of spit and vitriol today as they did almost a quarter century ago.  It was amazing to hear Elvis finally do &quot;Radio Radio&quot; on SNL, backed up by the Beastie Boys!  If you're wondering when Elvis was actually &quot;cruel,&quot; listen to this masterpiece!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's easy to see why this is usually listed as among the best albums of the 70's.  Coming off a very decent debut album, few could have been ready for this brilliant follow-up which reminds me a lot of Tom Petty's best work with the Heartbreakers.  The musicianship and songwriting has improved greatly over the debut effort due no doubt to the more polished backing band that represents the Attractions as well as Costello himself imcreasing in confidence and maturing in ability.  The sound quality of this remastered version is also brilliant and together with the wonderful mini-lp sleeve design which includes all the lyrics in English and Japanese as an insert make this the best version of this album that is out there at the moment.  Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you are in a party mood, this is definitely a record to play. The variation between tracks is not that great but that is not the most critical issue hear because most of the songs are really good.  The extra  tracks add soemthing sepcial especially the last three acoustic ones as I  never pictured Elvis as an acoustic artist.  He does quite well in that  realm.  However, Pump It Up, Lip Service, and No Action are my three faves  on this one.  Elvis really puts alot of effort into this one and that will  make it a good deal for most record collections."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Costello's first album, MY AIM IS TRUE, was perfect. His second album, THIS YEAR'S MODEL, is even better. On this album, all of the sexual tension that had been built up on his debut gets released. Just take a look at the  song titles. This album is very much about sex. Fortunately, Costello is  literate enough that he doesn't have to stoop to using graphic language.  Instead, he uses all sorts of similies and metaphors. This album just  explodes with energy. Also, this album serves as a wonderful transition  from his first album, MY AIM IS TRUE, to his third album, ARMED FORCES."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Costello's second album continues in the same vein as his debut, angry tales of love, lust, and sheer pent up frustration. Dominated by Steve Nieve's organ, this CD is more polished than Costello's debut, but it feels a little over produced compared to the stripped down sound of his first release. Despite this the songs still create a sense of tension rarely found in anyone's music. &quot;Radio, Radio&quot; may be one of the greatest songs ever about the idea of &quot;popular music&quot; and its effect on us all and the double play of &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;Pump It Up&quot; sums up teen years pretty well. Costello is a truly original talent and this CD shows him during the early years, still coming to grips with many of the same ideas and fears that faced his liteners.

{"label": 9, "raw": "I'm so sick of packing for college, I go back on saturday. I really need a break. Ahh, nothing like cdnow reviews to kill time.Anyway, I'm living proof that this album is an alltime great enjoyed by people of all ages.  I love it, my friends love it, my friends parents love it. Every song is hummable and instantly burrows its way deep into your head where it wont come out for weeks. On top of that, this is a lyrical masterpiece only topped by my Aim is true (who else would use the term rhythmically admired). It may not be as diverse as the later albums but its our last chance to hear good old-school hard rocking elvis. This should be considered required listening for any rock mucic fan. Do yourself a favor and buy this and if you already have it buy it for someone who doesnt."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "elvis costello is never easy to pin down. he's a punk, a crooner, a folkie and a jazzman all at once. one thing is certain, he is a brlliant artist and a great songwriter, with a healthy pop sense. before costello branched out into other styles, his main focus on the punky side of pop. and this is his most defining moment in that era. each song on here crackles with the tight energy associated with punk, but there is too much tongue and cheek for this be hardcore. moreover, the songwriting is just too clever to ignore, further removing \"this year's model\" from the general english punk movement. elvis was always too civilized to be chaotic and angry, more of a crossed up lover than anything else. this year's model is just a brilliant album overall and should be in anyone's collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you love music you must obtain this cd period. Every cut is fantastic. Standouts include Pump it Up with its throbing punkish traits, Lip Stick Vogue  with its defiently witty lyrics \"Sometimes i almost feel like a human\" , Living in Paradise with its full bodied sound, Radio, Radio \"You better shup up or get cut out\", a live version of NEAT NEAT NEAT, i could list every trac the cd is that good. It was a important album when it came out giving early clues to who the true king of rock and roll is... a man named Elvis after all. WARNING dont buy this album unless you want to be blown away with an album from 1978 that is as fresh today as it way when it was the day it was pressed into an LP.  An essential album not only of Costello but of Rock."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Rhino Records and Elvis Costello deserve high praise for this re-release. This two cd set contains the original album on the first disc and a second disc of outtakes, live versions and an odd couple of songs- all of fairly high quality. Accompanying the two cds is an essay by Elvis Costello commenting on the songs and the history behind their inclusion or exclusion in the case of the second cd.This Years model features a young Elvis Costello fresh from his Saturday Night Live \"Radio Radio\" era. The cd is full of quirk energy, clever lyrics and youthful anger. From first song to last there isn't a bad tune.  The additional cd contains the lost \"Big Tears\" which Costello explains should have been included in the original album. Also in the second cd are live versions and a cover of the Damned \"Neat Neat Neat\". This album and the half dozen or more to follow were among the most influential music being made by the Punk/New Wave . Great stuff."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "While dismissed as Costello-Lite by some, this is arguably EC's masterpiece.  While retaining the feistiness of his first two albums, Armed Forces showcases Costello's evolving prowess in crafting really good pop(ular) songs.  'Oliver's Army' and 'What's So Funny...?' shine here, but there are another half dozen or so excellent cuts.The Armed Forces bonus disc is likely the best in the Rhino reissue series.  Alternative versions of 'Busy Bodies', 'Accidents...' and 'Goon Squad' are interesting.  'Stranger in the House' and scorching, live performances of 'Lipstick Vogue' and 'Mystery Dance' are classics.Excellent value here at $14.99.

{"label": 9, "raw": "Elvis Costello is one of the music world's smartest artists. He also has a gift for finding the greatest musicians. The bassist, Bruce Thomas, is the most innovative rock player I've ever heard. Elvis' thoughtful lyrics are perfectly suited to his driving band.Unlike most artists, Elvis Costello has an excess of ideas in most songs. He also writes far too many songs. The extra tracks written at the same time are very good and are thankfully included here. Hats off to Rykodisc for treating this artist with the respect he deserves by reissuing these recordings properly. Other record labels should learn alot from them.[DW]"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Coming off the very good second effort of \"This Year's Model\", \"Armed Forces\" represents a slightly more mellow Elvis albeit with the same biting, hard-hitting lyrics.  The synthesizer comes more into prominence on this album which sees a departure from the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers'-type sound of the previous album and the sound is less edgy.  Although not quite as good as the second album overall, this third album is no slouch either.This version of the album which comes in a mini-lp sleeve design which has an almost origami type cardboard outer cover which contains a booklet with both Japanese and English lyrics as well as 4 picture postcards has one of the best album covers I've ever seen; the artistic representation of a herd of elephants is simply stunning to behold.  The remastered sound quality is very good too.This is a real treat for all Elvis Costello fans and is certainly a collectors' item."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "At the time of its release I liked a few songs but didn`t appreciate this album as a whole.  Bought it recently because of the few good tunes I remember liking only to be surprised at how good the other tunes are.  This relates especially to what used to be B-side material when records were the music media; notable tracks being Sunday`s Best and Two Little Hitlers.I recently read that Costello listened a great deal to ABBA shortly before recording this album.  This is evident in the fluency of the songs, many very catchy tunes that is maybe disguised by the more organic production style.  The style of singing by Costello is marvelous, a very descriptive way of expressing the words as in \"...add to your collection\" in the brilliant Accidents Will Happen.  The texts are, by the way, well worth going through with a booklet in hand while listening.A highly recommendable album that has aged well, a must have for anyone liking Elvis Costello."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought this album the week it came out, and as a high school tenth grader and aspiring guitarist/ pop songwriter it was the wisest purchase I could have made. This is a recording that shaped me musically in just so  many ways. Elvis in his early days (first 5 or 6 albums) was the man as far  as lyrics go. No one else could ever be this clever with words. The  Attractions, especially Bruce Thomas on bass(one of the best in pop)were  the perfect band for Costello. I see the live EP (At Hollywood High) which  accompanied the original LP release has been added as part of the bonus  cuts; long overdue, and that 7 inch was such a bad pressing. This release  is indescribably essential for any young aspiring modern tunesmith."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I think this is an album where either you're into it, or you aren't -- it isn't an issue of whether it's a \"good\" record, or a \"bad\" one.  As a fan of Costello's early work, as well as a fairly well-informed country fan, I've found this to be an album that's grown on me over the years. He knew what is was doing, and he did it well. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I love country music -- the real stuff -- the kind Elvis attempts here. I also love Elvis Costello; for the past week, I have listened incessantly to his collaboration with Burt Bacharach, \"Painted From Memory.\"*So with that as a perspective, I have to say that this may be the weakest effort in the entire Elvis catalog. Getting Billy Sherrill in Nashville surely was the right thing to do, but these songs don't click, and about none of these covers can stand along side the original. I can't specifically carp about the playing or the vocals, but where they fail is in capturing the heart, the spirit, the feel of country music. They sound too much like an experiment. Years later, Van Morrison, another giant, would fail in a similar effort.*For sure, this is not a \"bad\" album, but there are 20 better collections that Elvis has recorded and thousands of better country albums."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Costello fans will likely brand me a heretic, but 'Bedroom' seems to me to be one of his more overrated recordings. 'Beyond Belief' and 'Man Out of Time' certainly rate consideration in a 'Best of' compilation. 'Long Honeymoon', 'Human Hands' and 'Every Home' are somewhat interesting. However, beyond that I find little that's especially compelling here.There are treats on the bonus disc that I enjoy more than much of the original 'Bedroom' recordings, thanks in part to Steve Nieve's scorching work on the ivories. In fact, the alternative version of 'The Town Where Time Stood Still' and the toe-tap inducing \"From Head to Toe\" merit inclusion on my desert-island list of Elvis favorites."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The true test of good Costello is ... do you find the songs running  through your head hours later?  With this album, I find one whole side  buzzing in my head - the second.  (In CD land where there is no sides, this  means songs 8 and up).  &quot;Pidgin English&quot; has one line that slides  so gracefully over one held synthsizer note that it's unforgettable.  You'll know what I mean when you come to it.  Keeping the songs short, yet  substantial, Costello works as if he were writing for 78's, and the sound  resembles that somewhat.  Lots of piano.  Yet not really nostalgic either.  I don't find the first side as compelling, and yet &quot;And In Every  Home&quot; is so charming that it almost redeems it.  Timneless All in all,  this is the one Costello album with an infinite Sell By date."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Listen to the opening lines of \"The Loved Ones\" and you hear Costello at his best. Snappy lines, sung with force and definitely dripping with caustic wit. Then we hit the piano \"noodling\" and the song starts to drift away from me. The CD is filled with moments like this; great lyrics and a solid melody often lost amidst overproduced musical adornments. Stripped down, this is some of Costello's best stuff; songs that walk the fine line between emotion and intellect. But every time I feel like I get close to the heart of the song, I feel lost in the middle of music that serves no purpose. This is definitely worth a listen and I still enjoy popping it in the machine, but I feel some of his other works is more deserving of the high praise given IMPERIAL BEDROOM."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I've always thought \"Imperial Bedroom\" to be Elvis' masterpiece and only recently listened to it again through headphones a la REM's \"Up\". I'd never listened to it before this way and the sound and subtle nuances are even better enjoyed this way. Elvis' songwriting on \"Imperial Bedroom\" was at it's most crisp, witty and insightful. Every track on here is a true jem...a shining jewel. Well worth the money if you spring for the gold masterdisc. Some of these songs made me cry then and still resonate now. I'm glad I saw him on the \"Imperial Bedroom\" tour and glad I have this CD!I still get a kick out of how one track bleeds into the next with assorted yelps and screams.  And the lyrics...my God...at his peak Elvis really was brilliant!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Hailed by Columbia at the time of its release as a masterpiece and trashed by many critics expecting business as ususal from EC & The Attractions, Imperial Bedroom stands as a pivotal album in EC's career. Why? Because he created a diverse musical experience echoing everything from the Tin Pan Alley gaints to his British music idols (most notably The Beatles). It's technicolor production and sweeping lyrical themes make it one of the top 100 albums of all time. Imperial Bedroom along with This Year's Model, Armed Forces, Blood & Chocolate and King of America represent early Costello at his best; intelligent, witty and musical adept at adopting a number of musical styles.This reissue has stunning sound, complete liner notes by EC, complete lyrics as well as a second disc that includes the bonus tracks from the Ryko release. Add to that the alternate takes, demos and you have a reissue worth having. Price as a single disc collection, Imperial Bedroom is well worth purchasing again just to have all the extra"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's commonly agreed that 'Goodbye' is not one of Costello's better efforts.  I concur, but must confess enjoyment of two songs that are generally cursed by EC purists:  'I Wanna Be Loved' and 'Only Flame in Town'.While not lyrically compelling, I find the songs musically enjoyable.  Love the strange synth feel to 'Wanna' and even the sax solo.  The demo version of 'Only Flame' on EC's 'All This Useless Beauty' bonus disc is superior to the standard recording here.  Costello originally seems to have conceived the song as a 50s style slow dance number.  It's kitschy but fun!'The Comedians', also recorded by the late Roy Orbison, is about the only other cut of significant interest.  Like 'Only Flame', the demo version of this song on Rhino's 'All This Useless Beauty' bonus disc is better than the one here."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I will defer to all the laudatory comments listed here.  I had one observation, however, regarding this new version by Rhino vs. the previous, also-excellent version by Rykodisc.The final track on the Ryko CD was \"A Town Called Big Nothing (Really Big Nothing)\", a wonderful, 5-minute+ little gem originally writen for a Alex Cox film that featured Costello's father on trumpet.However, it is NOT included on the new Rhino CD. This is a curious and unfortunate omission, so FYI to all who are considering replacing the Ryko's.  Perhaps Rhino will include it on one of the future Costello releases.(UPDATE: The track never made it to any of the Rhino releases.  It now only appears on The Singles Volume 3 set.)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "After a couple of years of more subtle work, Elvis Costello reteamed with the Attractions for a fierce, angry release, Blood &amp; Chocolate.  With producer extrodinaire Nick Lowe again manning the board, Mr. Costello spewed forth venomous songs based around his recent divorce.  &quot;I Hope You're Happy Now&quot; sums up the overall tone of the album.  &quot;Tokyo Storm Warning&quot; is a blistering extended jam, while &quot;Honey Are You Straight Or Are You Blind?&quot; is a frenetically paced rocker that harkened back to the band's late 70's sound.  &quot;I Want You&quot; is a song that conveys Mr. Costello's longing for his lost relationship. Despite the overall angry tone, the album closes with &quot;Next Time Round&quot; which shows a more wizened man that will learn from his mistakes."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Man this is one great blues guitar album! It may be listed under Albert Collins, but this is a true collaboration. Robert Cray really shines here and is much bluesier then you will find him on his own albums. All three share in the vocal duties and the guitar solos.  No one plays over each other - it's a great collaboration that results in a great album.  Just listen to the first cut and you will get a good taste of what is in store.  Buy it and enjoy."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Albert Collins and Johnny Copeland were two of the pioneers of Texas blues, and major influences to the late Stevie Ray Vaughan. These two guys work their magic on this CD, and bring on a young bluesman named Robert Cray. These guys just seem to have fun with this CD, never trying to outdo each other. Great riffs in the leadoff track &quot;T-Bone Shuffle&quot;, harmonica on &quot;Bring Your Fine Self Home&quot;, lyrics in &quot;Black Cat Bone&quot; (hear Johnny Copeland yelling &quot;Hey Albert!&quot;) and the last track &quot;Blackjack&quot; where each does a tremendous guitar solo. Cray, of course, is now a major talent in his own right, and Johnny Copeland lives on in a way in his daughter Shemekia Copeland's music, but here is a playful, low-key yet powerful, piece of work from some of the masters of electric blues. Highly recommended for serious blues fans."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Ms. Baez has a pure, crystalline voice that is an instrument unto itself. You will know what I mean when you hear her sing \"Waggoner's Lad\" without accompaniment. This is quickly followed up by some achingly beautiful folk songs, such as \"The Trees They Do Grow High\", \"The Lily of the West\", and \"Silkie\". Wham Bam... before you know it, you are hooked!This extraordinary CD originally ended  with \"Plaisir D'Amour\", which is a beautiful love song and, sung by Ms. Baez, one that will not be easily forgotten. This released, which has remastered the original recording, now has three additional bonus tracks that are pleasant additions to an already marvelous musical experience.  This is simply a wonderful CD, and if you are not already a fan of Ms. Baez, it will quickly make you into one. She is, undoubtedly, a national treasure."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Listening to \"In Concert\" today, I am struck by Joan Baez's keen ability to interpret these beautiful folk songs.  She truly was in her element.  More than that \"achingly pure soprano,\" she was able to convey the drama, the pathos, and the sheer longing of the lyrics.  Just listening to her performance of \"Matty Groves,\" I can get so drawn in to the song that I can visualize the proceedings.  She was also a very accomplished and talented guitar player.  Joan Baez had a tremendous impact on American popular music and you can hear why in this recording."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "At the start of her career Joan Baez's pure, soulful voice was the signature of the early 60's folk movement; it is perhaps best displayed on this album and on Vol. 1 of the same. There is a special magic in her voice, her guitar and the response of the appreciative audience. The Portuguese song on this album, Nu Bello Cardillo, is touching but not as memorable as Ate Amanha on the first volume, while there's a lovely tremulous quality to her voice in the Dylan song With God On Our Side. My favorites on this second volume include the sorrowful tale of The Long Black Veil and the traditionals Hush Little Baby and Battle Hymn Of The Republic - the audience participation on the Hymn is very poignant and moving, and turns into a rousing spiritual experience. I personally prefer the first volume since more of those songs have personal meaning to me, but this folk classic is also an enduring treasure."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Paris is one of the many hip-hip artist from the early 1990's that didnt get alot of airplay, and mainly sold records on word of mouth. Let me tell you that even though Paris's other releases aren't as strong as this, \"The Devil Made me Do It\" has flavor that most hip-hop has lost today, and that is dealing with racial tensions, political issues, and Black History (ex..Black Panthers) The beats are also mind blowing, and this album is very Hard for the time that it was released. Even though the album is somewhat dated, it still is a treasure, and I hope people that are infactuated with todays hip-hop could take a few steps back and pick up an album of such importance. This CD belongs in EVERYONES collection. Its that good! (i only gave if 4 stars because even though it is a classic, there are some poor filler tunes here) ENJOY"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's the Hip hop's hair doo master Coolio on a debut album, my locc Coolio went from B.G. to Locc'sta from Compton, CA aka the CPT. Like I said on my review from Gangsta's Paradice, Coolio be blowin' on some Indo or some other type of funky gangee, because Coolio was the locc who released the ultimate house party groove Fantastic Voyage by far Coolio's dopest hit, County Line is a far out Dope song by my locc, Ghetto Cartoon is a funny cartoonished song with funny lyrics, and my locc has another good one called Ugly Bitches, what!? It's a true song by my locc Coolio."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album absolutely kicks the snot out of 95%+ of the music to come since. Picking highlights for this album is difficult but here's a couple:Ghetto Cartoon: Coolio gives you a rather twisted urban fairy tale featuring all the WB and Disney characters, hilarious and deft.Gangsta's Paradise: The title track to a major movie, and one of they very few rap songs that goes for 'haunting' and achieves it.Mama, I'm In Love Wit A Gangsta: Told half in telephone conversation and all in style.Just buy the album already."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Now, I'm not a big Coolio fan.  But I've just always liked the song &quot;Gangsta's Paradise&quot;.  Even though that's the initial reason I bought the album, there are many more good songs on it.  I like the song &quot;Ghetto Highlights&quot; almost as much as the title track.  &quot;Sumpin New(1,2,3,4)&quot; is a pretty catchy tune I used to hear at roller skate places a lot.  Those are my 3 favorite songs, but I also like the songs &quot;Kinda High, Kinda Drunk&quot; and &quot;Exercise Yo' Game&quot;.  The only reason I took off a star is because since this is an edited album, there are a couple of songs that could be good that are edited so much, it takes away from the songs."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought this album mainly for GANGSTA'S PARADISE.  I've never been a huge Coolio fan, but I liked the song.  There were a couple of other good songs on the album, especially the one with the guest appearance by WC (the  Shadiest!).  The lyrics and the beats on that were pretty tight.  The rest  of the album was enjoyable, but nothing outstanding.  The lyrics were  nothing special and the production was mediocre...he needed more work from  Crazy Toones.This album isn't a must have unless you're a Coolio fan,  but it's enjoyable."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "But sadly it's not enough to save the album.  Except for that one song the album fails on many levels (Even for rap music) with it's anoying lyrics, bad beats, and even bad rapping!  Personally I think this guy has got some talent and is just afraid to use it.  He proved he's got the skill to be one of the greatest rappers out there with &quot;Gangsta's Paradise,&quot; and in the &quot;Space Jam&quot; soundtrack he (With the help of other rappers) helped make the best rap song I've herd!  He just needs to use some of his talent and he could go far and shove cheap rappers like Eminem out of the way!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Earth A.D. is probably the heaviest, most aggressive recording The Misfits have ever released. This CD features their famous song \"Die Die My Darling\", as well as many other great songs. \"Wolf's Blood\" is a twisted portrait of a man who is transforming into a werewolf. Danzig's howls of pain and aggression are amazing, and the frantic guitars and drums in the song make it a favorite. \"Queen Wasp\" and \"Earth A.D.\" are very heavy songs, although those two tracks in particle don't have great sound quality. Right after this album was released, thrash metal was unleashed in the world of Rock. Coincidence? Perhaps, but this CD obviously had to have some influence on the artists of the category. Pick this one up today."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The thing about Brand X, I mean besides it having caused me to take back all--well, most, anyway--of the nasty things I've said about Phil Collins over the years, is that their virtuosity as players is not just self-serving masturbation. These guys ARE virtuosos, but they use their skills to make really awesome music which serves the listener. I bought a few Brand X records (yes, records.... on vinyl), decades ago and the music is on my iPod today. If standing the test of time is one measure of good music, then this is good indeed.And, let's face it, for many like myself, this band turned the Phil Collins legacy from the lame, forgettable pop stuff he churned out like a placebo factory, to \"Holy crap; this guy is a seriously talented player\".\"Unorthodox Behaviour\" and \"Morrocan Roll\" are my favorites, though all of the Brand X releases are enjoyable."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In the mid seventies jazz-fusion was at it's peak and there was no shortage of quality records being released. For me, one of the fusion bands that stood out was Brand X. Their music was captivating, all band members were tremendous talents, but most importantly, they had an original sound. Thirty years after it's release, this debut disc still is amazing and would be a great introduction to this band. John Goodsall shreds with the best of them but his soothing guitar work is just as striking. The chirping tones that Percy Jones creates on his fretless bass are unmistakable. Robin Lumley enhances it all by playing the perfect keyboard riff at the right time, and Phil Collins, on a break from Genesis, laid down some exciting drumming, maybe some of the best he has ever done. Enjoy."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First song, 20 minutes &quot;Crises&quot; is as good as &quot;Tubular bells&quot;.  The first 2 minutes are maybe a bit too new age but the rest is really uncredible especially the Watcher and the tower part.  The great Admam Ant is playing guitar on this song.Song &quot;In high places&quot; is sang by Jon Anderson (I just can't resist him).  I did not know it was Oldfield who did &quot;Shadow on the wall&quot;, a song that I liked a lot back in early 80's.  Well, it is on this album.  &quot;Taurus&quot; is a excellent  accoustic guitar piece.The 2 others songs are okay but I am not attracted to women's voice."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Not Mike's best album, but certainly a very good one. The second part of Taurus here is one of his better epic-length compositions, here reprising at the start the original chord progression from Taurus I, but played on different instruments. It goes above and beyond the scope of the first however, across the path of it's 25 minutes. Family Man follows, a track he co-wrote with a bunch of other people, and definately a different one for Mike. It's almost like a standard rock/pop song, fused with his own guitar and instrumentation. (It later became a hit for Hall &amp; Oates.) The remaining songs are decent enough, but don't really hold up to the standard of the opening epic. Still, an Oldfield fan will want this album for it alone, in addition to the adequate tracks that fill out the album."}

Going on almost 27 years after they hashed this moster out in the studio, This Misfits album is one of the best of the late-70's, call it whatcha will, fearless, boundless, badass music.

{"label": 9, "raw": "Glen Danzig and his friends have simply made the best punk cd ever.  And it would be this cd.  I guess I'm not too much into the politics of punk, but this is a truely great cd.  With its cheesy B-Horror movie lyrics, traditional punk riffs, and 50's esque vocals, this band is, in general, just a fun band.  They are by far the #1 Halloween band ever.  They don't care what anyone really thinks, so they basically do whatever they please.  Some people may be offended by some of their lyrics or something, but oh well.  Glen Danzig should have never left this band, or they would be by far one of the most respected bands ever.  Wait, they already are!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album still sounds so good.  The songs are simple but driving with great rythm lines and great drumming.  Mr. Danzig has recently in my opinion entered his fat Elvis mode(if you get a chance, you should watch the online video of him getting punched out for being an insufferable jerk), but there is no question as to the brilliance of his vocals on this album.  His voice(to continue the analogy) sounds like a possessed Elvis.  It's amazing.  Angry but in tune.  Static Age is much more in the punk vein of the Ramones, and less like bands the Germs or Black Flag, which Earth A.D. sounds more like.  The songs are all great sing alongs.  Anthems even.  I suppose his lyrics aren't for everyone, but I personally view them as ironic in that sort of dark humor kind of way.  Even if punk isn't your normal cup of tea, you should still give this album a try."}

If you like Ben Folds's stuff, you should pick this up. Pick it up if you're not. Buy it. Enjoy it. Love it, it will love you back, i promise. OK, this reviews isn't so good, i know.

This first eponymous CD is filled with great songs...every single one a \"keeper.\"  \"Jackson Cannery\", \"Philosophy,\" \"Boxing,\" \"Uncle Walter,\" \"Underground\"...great songs to drive around in your car and rock out to.  These guys were so good...I like Ben's solo work, of course, but the Ben Folds Five were the greatest."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Five stars isn't sufficient for an album that contains &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin,&quot; one of the great vocal tracks sung by anyone. Many consider this song Sinatra's greatest and Nelson Riddle's arrangement is  nothing short of electric. This is an album where you can put it on, hit  play and never fast forward, all the songs are eminently Sinatraesque and  every single arrangement has a touch of genius.Frank's phrasing is (as  always at this stage of his career) letter perfect. Listen to &quot;It  Happened in Monterey...&quot; never a particular hit, Frank rarely sang it  live, but who cares? It's immortalized here, forever.If you love  Sinatra, you will already have had this on vinyl and cassette (maybe even  eight track). If you're new to Frank, don't hesitate one moment: grab it  and listen to it for the rest of your life."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Although this lighthearted version of Sinatra doesn't appeal to me as much as his darker side does, there's no denying Riddle knows how to make anything swing, and the Voice delivered a tune--virtually any tune--better than jsut about anyone, save Ella Fitzgerald.And, while some of these tunes are a tad too cutesy for me, &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; is perfection, &quot;It Happened In Monterey&quot; shimmys seductively, and Sinatra's quiet approach to &quot;Anything Goes&quot; is charming."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Probably my favourite Sinatra's album. Released in 1956. Arrangements are done by Nelson Riddle and songs are fabulous. Here you can hear such great songs like on of his biggest hit, Cole Porter's I've Got You Under My Skin, Gershwin brothers' Love Is Here To Stay,...Pennies From Heaven was a big hit for Louis Prima, Anything Goes (another Porter's composition) for Ella Fitzgerald,...This is one of his best albums (and not only for Capitol Records).So, lay down and enjoy this fabulous set."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "For sheer joy and energy, this is Sinatra at his apex.  Every song is excellent, with crystal-clear sound, brassy horns, top-notch Nelson Riddle arranging, and Sinatra at his vocal best.  This album is often listed as one of the top 100 albums in any genre ever made, in often eclectic lists including everything from the Beatles to Nirvana to Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and the Beach Boys.  And though it's hard to narrow it down to one album, this is in my opinion Sinatra's best.  The songs are upbeat, and there is no way one can listen to this album without feeling better about life.I have this on both CD and vinyl.  The sound quality on the CD is clear and sharp."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "These recordings are now nearly fifty years old, but they contain an excitement that doesn't diminish with time.  Following quickly on the heels of his success with IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS, a 40-year-old Frank Sinatra teamed up once again with arranger/conducter Nelson Riddle and created what is arguably his best album of a stellar career. Sinatra is one of those artists that each generation rediscovers for itself. As an aging Baby Boomer, I hope that audiences will continue to listen to the Beatles a hundred years from now; but I KNOW they will be listening to Sinatra--class simply never goes out of style! If you own only one Sinatra album, this is it.  ESSENTIAL"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A great disc by a great collection of musicians.  Cannonball often takes a side role-even as a leader-to the playing of others, specifically Miles Davis, yet the album has a warmth and atmosphere that are fully his.  'Autumn Leaves' is a stunner-beautiful and long with great solo work by all.  'Love for sale' is also very catchy-you will probably recognize the melody when you hear it.  I think the last track is supposed to be called 'Rangoon' but I'm not positive-it is 'Bangoon' on the back of the jewel case.  A great introduction to Adderley's work.  Highly Recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you like Kind Of Blue, you are in for a real treat here. Adderley, Miles and Blakey were and still are such big stars in the jazz world that their work is in a class of its own. The fact that they are collaborating here is an added bonus. Adderley's joyful sound and Miles's Emotional Charges Harmon Mute is absolutely exquisite on this album. Best cut would definately be Autumn Leaves, since Miles's work on this track almost brings a tear to my eyes because it is so beautiful."}

I was very lucky to have an aunt who instilled in me a love for jazz at a very young age. She like Clifford Brown fell victim to autos, which could have been safer, for the speeds they could attain.My loss was a family loss, Clifford Brown was a loss to jazz and music in general. I was lucky and was exposed to so much music, I moved from the Philadelphia area to the East Village in the 60's to be closer to the music scene.I would not hesitate in suggesting this to anyone, it is a part of jazz history.There are recordings that no matter how many times you hear them they will fill you with something new. Music like this has an appeal that draws you out of yourself and into the artist's vision. Good listening"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Whenever I need a lift, this is a good choice to provide one. This is also one of those CD's that, when I'm facing my music collection and not sure what I'm in the mood for, this is one of my \"default\" CD's. (The others areJazz in SilhouetteandBilly Taylor Trio.) You just can't go wrong when Miles Davis is involved, and Adderley brings a whole new dimension to the definition of a small horn section. Blakey's unmistakeable ferocity in driving the tunes provides a great backbone for the other musicians to build on, and each listening brings its own indescribable pleasure. I would say this is a CD that should be added to the collection of any serious jazz fan, and it would probably be a good choice for someone looking to broaden a non-jazz oriented music collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I genuinly agree with the 5 stars given to all the editions of this MARVELOUS albums (one of my favorite modern jazz albums I've heard so far)...I would just like to add that I agree with those who are of opinion that Miles, although officially the sideman on the Cannonball date, is actually the main star, with the glorious rhythm section contributing at least as much (if not more) than the official leader...Don't get me wrong, Cannonball is great, but it is the lyrical trumpet of Miles Davis that galvanizes and organizes the group (\"Autumn Leaves\"!), and even on the funkier performances of the album Miles is equal to the funky Cannonball, with the Joneses and Blakey working beautifully together...."}

Until I bought and listened to the 2000 Island remaster of \"Heaven Is In Your Mind\" This is the original stereo american version of the album, and the one, that I have been waiting for for at least 30 years to be released. It has the original american track listing including two tracks that were dropped when they re-released it as \"Mr. Fantasy\" which is the english version (stereo much less defined). I highly recommend \"Heaven Is In Your Mind\" to anybody that grew up in the sixty's as I did, and remember the superb stereo on the original UA release."}

Hadn't heard this CD in ages, as I've never really kept up with his work that much. Liked this ageless neo-classical / New Age title more so than I remember. Both tracks here - \"Heaven And Hell, Part 1\" and \"Heaven And Hell, Part 2\" - clocking in at over twenty minutes each. Jon Anderson (Yes) provides the vocals on \"So Long Ago, So Clear\" - a portion of the Part 1 cut, I'm sure I used to hear that song on late night FM radio many moons ago. Thoroughly enjoyed this CD reissue's beautiful symphonic passages that manage to take the listener(s) by surprize. Should appeal to fans of Patrick Moraz, Yanni, Tangerine Dream and Mike Oldfield."}

It's rare when 4 &quot;superstars&quot; can get  together and produce a sound this good. It's rarer still when they can keep  doing it. Asia didn't. After this album they tried to  &quot;cookie-cut&quot; their songs and they became trite and boring. But  for one sweet summer this was the music that the world was loving. Do  yourself a favor. BUY THIS CD!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Asia was the first band I called \"my favourite one\". Via Asia, I got to know my later and present favourite Yes.The influence of Yes shines through in this first album of the band. It is especially obvious in the  afterplay to Cutting It Fine.But this is mainly a rock album. Some  call it prog rock - who knows why - indeed, it is true that there is more  to it than just plain 1980's rock. It has a touch, it has more soul. It is  bombastic rock without even being close to hardrock. Well worth listening  to!My favourites on this debut album are Wildest Dreams, One Step  Closer, and of course the first single Heat Of The Moment."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Let's look at this cd for what it was: a great pop record. Sure, it was completely calculated by David Geffen, head of Geffen records at the time. However, their are so few superstar bands that this one, along with Blind  Faith, holds up over time. I was just 10 years old when I got this cd, and  it sounds dated now, but it brings back good memories. I have since become  an ardent Yes, ELP, King Crimson, Buggles, Genesis and Rush fan. Asia was  just a fun ride, nothing meant to be taken seriously. However, of all their  albums I do believe their first was their best. It's a good cd for those of  us who can remember Asia at all."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In 1982, it seemed as if the new supergroup Asia would be the great white hope of AOR fans. Most of the 70's supergroups had either disbanded or faded into obscurity, and Asia looked to be the heirs of the format and the band that would continue the glories of FM rock into the 80's. Alas, after this first LP, Asia descended into mediocrity, turning out many more albums, none of which equalled this outstanding debut. This record is a document of What Might Have Been, simply put. Well worth owning, and a fitting coda to the great rock albums of the 70's."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Asia's debut album has sold many millions...and not least for the song \"The Heat of the Moment\" which you probably have heard sometimes even haven't heard the name \"Asia\". There's so many great songs \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Only Time Will Tell\" (ballad), \"Without You\", \"Sole Survivor\"...the funny \"Cutting It Fine\"...and the classic keyboard track \"Here Comes the Feeling\"...John Wetton in vocals made excellent work...he is much better than John Payne who isn't bad either...John Wetton made with Asia two other great albums \"Astra\" and \"Alpha\". John Wetton's voice is very soft and sensitive...just great for this kind of soft progressive rock.Stars: Wildest Dreams, Heat of the Moment, Without You"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Asia is the grandest superband on earth. But why Asia? They tried to show that this is no traditional British progressive rock nor American progressive hard rock and it lies somewhere between. Heat of the Moment, Only Time Will Tell, Sole Survivor are super-excellent. Particularly interim keyboard bridge part of Soul Survivor has been embedded in my memory for so long. Rest of the tracks are very dynamic as well and showing the longtime legacy of British prog a bit. John Wetton's clear voice is another of the band's appeal. Recommended for wide range of melodic rock and progressive rock fans who may like Dream Theater."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Asia was Steve Howe, John Wetton, Geoffrey Downes, and Carl Palmer. These four guys would become instant stars with their debut album, simply titled, Asia. Howe was already an accomplished guitarist with the progressive supergroup, Yes, while Carl Palmer brought his talents from the equally-successful progressive trio, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Downes was a keyboard player for Yes' Drama album from 1980, and Whetton was an accomplished vocalist elsewhere. They would fuse their talents and come up with some of the most memorable songs of the 80's, and of all time. Songs like HEAT OF THE MOMENT, SOLE SURVIVOR, and ONLY TIME WILL TELL are classics to this day. These guys would stick around for several more years and albums, and wouldn't match the success of their first album. Still, they were a great band that put out some great music. 9/10"}

Touching on smooth & lovely jazz on numbers like \"Moon At The Window\" & \"Ladie's Man\" then switching back into rock & roll soul romps such as \"You Dream Flat Tires\" & \"You're So Square\". Other amazing moments include the melodic flipped-collar Vienna dreamscape of \"Underneath The Streetlight\" & the appropriately suave \"Be Cool\", & ending with the wonderful \"Love\" whichs rings true for everyone. She proclaims:\"Love suffers longLove is kind!Enduring all thingsLove has no evil in mindIf I had the gift of prophecyAnd all the knowledgeAnd the faith to move the mountainsEven if I understood all of the mysteriesIf I didn't have loveI'd be nothing.\"This is a wonderful expreimental album with fun & also introverted moments.

For one, none of the 4 bonus songs are on the \"Mellow Gold\" album.\"Corvette Bummer\" is in the same vain as the \"Mellow Gold\" album, with an irresitable beat. \"Alcohol\" is an accoustic reflective tune, quite nice. \"Soul Sucking Jerk\" is a 6 min. scratch-and-rap tune, also irresistable. \"Fume\" is the only weak track of the bunch.Beck has done many different things since \"Mellow Gold\".

You need to find this version of the single as well, because the songs on this particular version are really cool, but having a Beck collection at your home without MTV MAKES ME WANT TO SMOKE CRACK is like showing up at church naked...it's UNSPEAKABLE!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Ah, the sound of those synthesized drums that were EVERYWHERE in 1984. If Orwell had his book to write over again, he'd warn us about the shelf life of those babies.  Musically, songs like the title track and \"Sunset Grill\" scream to you loud and clear exactly when they were made, but the album still hits home today.  With Walmart and various other corporations running the world, the lyrics of \"Sunset Grill\" are even more relevant today (and ironic, since the real location is now owned by a corporation!).  \"A Month of Sundays\" has got to be one of the most poignant songs I have EVER heard, and it could certainly apply to many industries besides farming.  \"The Boys of Summer\" still holds up as just about the best song from the 1980's, and \"Not Enough Love\" and \"You're Not Drinking Enough\" show us why Don just might be the best vocalist in all of popular music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Although several songs here haven't aged well, the majority of this album allows us to remember  the days of conspicuos consumption and moral bankruptcy that defined the 1980's. \"All She Wants To Do Is Dance\" is my favorite here: anyone who has ever traveled abroad and been embarresed in public by the rude, ignorant behavior of our countrymen will relate to this one! \"A Months Of Sundays\"  takes up the forgotten plight of America's farmers, whose suicide rate for a while, at least among males, rivaled that of Western Samoa! \"Drivin' With Your Eyes Closed\" sums up our politicians today as well as it did in 1984.  Henley writes for Americans who still read books, and stil believe that individual freedom is the last doorstop we have left before the door of government-imposed conformity slams our heads in its marble-encrustedframe.This is easily one of the top 10 American rock albums of the 1980's!"}

Once you pop this into your cd  or cassette player you'll want to hear it several times.

Hong Kong Garden which burst onto the UK charts in 1978 still sounds unique and special after all these years while the other early hits have lost none of their icy appeal. I would have included some additional songs for a Best Of covering their early days, like &quot;Mother/Oh Mein Papa' from Join Hands and perhaps &quot;Jigsaw Feeling' from The Scream.

Its hilarious that when you hear a line, you can predict the next one.  I dont think Coverdale means anything he sings...he just picked the words cuz it sounds good...to him anyway.In the Still of the Night is no better.  The music sounds as if they intended it to be some brooding rock anthem.  Its like they were trying to create some type of mystery and suspense building towards  some rock zenith ...but when you hear the lyrics....all they are saying is \"Im horny...gimme some\".

The opener of the album is Crying in the Rain, which had originally appeared on their 1982 album Saints and Sinners, Here I go Again was also a rerecording of a song that appeared on Saints and Sinners.

The musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight and satisfying.  Most of the songs are straight-ahead hard rockers.  John Sykes does a great job with the guitar playing.  His guitar riffs and solos are really good, and he also helped write almost all of the album's material.  David Coverdale does a good job with the vocal duties.  There's also some nice keyboard playing throughout.  The songs that I like the most are &quot;Still of the Night,&quot; the ballad &quot;Is This Love,&quot; and &quot;Don't Turn Away.&quot;  All three are memorable and well-written songs.

Whitesnake was the best of the bands to pop up from Deep Purple alumni. This record gives Led Zeppelin a run for their money. It is even better then Van Halen's debut. John Sykes is one heck of an axe player. Neil Murrey had been im Whitesnake for it's entire career since it formed in '78. Dunbar is a decent metal drummer. Adrian Vandenburg did some guitar work on this album, and he also contributed the nicely done keyboards. A huge album, it was overshadowed by Guns N' Roses debut the same year.

The two lighter but very good tunes are Changes and Love Me. The  other songs on the album are also respectable.Jeff Keith has a good,  raspy vocal delivery that he practiced while driving cement mixers. It's  easy to identify Tesla's work by his singing. Great guitar work by Frank  Hannon is another of Tesla's signature trademarks. While the Great Radio  Controversy and The Best of Tesla are both albums worth acquiring, this is  by far their best effort."}

In a sea of poofy-hair heavy metal bands (and bands pretending to worship the devil), Tesla came out of nowhere with a debut album of straightforward hard rock songs. Sounding like a Midwestern Def Leppard, they had a couple ballads, three or four songs about rocking all night, and even a political song.Listening to it now, it's a little cheesy but too sincere to dislike. They know how to write a song and they can play, but they didn't have a gimmick that would embarass them later. The only real drawback to the album is the song \"Little Suzi.\" It's so good, you can't avoid noticing how mediocre the rest of the album is."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Robbie Robertson's self-titled solo debut is also his best album on his own. Retaining some of the spirit of his work with the Band, he brings in numerous guests, including Peter Gabriel and U2, to help out, and the result is that his trademark style is brought into the modern age. Influences ranging from U2 to the Meters are clearly audible here, along with Van Morrison, the Band, and Bob Dylan. There's a cautionary undertone to many of the songs, which is fitting considering that his former bandmate, Richard Manuel, had committed suicide the year before. This is a CD that you should own if you're a fan of folk-rock in any form."}

As I tried to sit through a duet of Billy Idol and Ms. Mitchell, I wondered what twisted muse had inspired one of my favorite singer/songwriters on this less than stellar recording.There are some bright moments here and there, but Ms. Mitchell's better works do not, in my opinion, include this album. I see from reading some of the other reviews that I am apparently \"ignorant\" or worse, and I'm sure that I'll soon have as many negative votes as a porcupine has quills for daring to state a qualified assessment of an icon's work.Guess, I'm the skunk at the picnic on this one."}

On SRATS, there are 12 consistent and  original songs with Edie's breathy vocals complimenting each one. The  music, lyrics and vocals are what make this a stand out cd. Sometimes the  first cd is the best from an artist and that would be accurate to say here.  It has the hits &quot;What I Am&quot; and &quot;Circle&quot; plus 8 other  tracks that are just as good.

Now for the songs:the title track,which is the first hit from this album,features Bruce Hornsby playing the piano. The track was written or co-written by Hornsby. Other hits include THE LAST WORTHLESS EVENING,I WILL NOT GO QUIETLY,THE HEART OF THE MATTER and NEW YORK MINUTE. GIMME WHAT YOU GOT features Geffen Records labelmate Edie Brickell singing background(I want it,I want it). NEW YORK MINUTE also appeared on the Eagles' reunion concert album HELL FREEZES OVER,released in 1994. All the other tracks are good."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;The End of the Innocence&quot; really hit home.When JFK was killed in Dallas,I lost my Innocence.This song,that Bruce Hornsby co-wrote,and plays keyboards on,just brings back that terrible day.I was only 8,but I still remember sitting in my 3nd Grade Classroom,and being sent home.This song also tells about the terrible Reagan years,with the line,&quot;For this tired old man that we elected king,&quot; and the preachers telling us not to sin,while there sleeping with everyone and stealing our money.Every song on this CD has some special meaning.&quot;I will not go Quietly,&quot;about turning your life around,&quot;The last worthless evening,&quot; a loveless relationship,and a the wonderfull fun cut,&quot;Shangri-la.&quot; The last song on the album,&quot;The Heart of the Matter,&quot; is my favorite.Just forget about hatred,and move on.&quot;You keep carryin that anger,it'll eat you up inside.&quot;When you play &quot;The End of the Innocence,&quot; you think about the end of he 80's.This album is Don Henley's greatest solo Album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Together with the other guys in Eagles, Don Henley assured his immortal place in rock history. I wonder - how can a man who was a part of something so great as the Eagles release such a [bad] bunch of songs? I just don't get it! I owned this album for many years but when it was time to \"weed out\" my cd collection I decided that this one have to go. But before I sold it, I wanted to record the best songs from it, but I must admit that I couldn't find a single song I really like. So, now it's gone, and I have not missed it for even a split second!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I had this on cassette back in '89. It was da soundtrack of my life back in da fall of 1990. cruising listenin to songs like the title track, i will not go quietly (with guest vocals by Axl Rose), Last Worthless Evening, and another minor FM hit, If Dirt Were Dollars, which i thought was da bomb back in da summer/fall of '89. I remember the duet with Patti Smyth from Scandal (darn, it was only '89 and she was already a has been -lol_). Get this again if yer in da mood for nostagia, personally, i don't think i'd go as far as getting this album, there's some turd filler on here that sounds like the era it was recorded in, maybe download I Will Not Go Quietly and If Dirt Were Dollars, which were IMO, the best ones on there, and maybe dats just da nostalgia talkn."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "There is always a day of reckoning. As the 1980's drew to a close, Don Henley's conscience cracked wide open, leaving no alternative but exorcizing the demons that dominiated from the mid-70's forward. This was the end of the innocence.The title track is an accomplishment in musicianship, but also a fine look at society's descent into shattered myths coupled with dreams destroyed. Great song for lying under a tree on a lazy summer day, wondering where it all went wrong.\" I Won't Go Quietly\" is a fabulous duet with none other than Axl Rose. It seriously rocks. \" If Dirt Were Dollars\" is so direct the metaphors get lost. \" The Heart of the Matter\", the closing track, finds Henley melancholy, accepting equal parts sorrow and blame. It's an open invitation to put self aside in order to return some dignity.A little philosphical, a lot melodic, this continues to stay fresh, almost twenty years later."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Don Henley has faced his fair share of personal troubles. Busted for &quot;entertaining&quot; underage prostitutes, smeared (along with the rest of the Eagles) by Rolling Stone on a regular basis and never quite taken  seriously as a songwriter by critics, The Age Of Innocence is timely  revenge.Easily as good as and less dated sounding than Building The  Perfect Beast, this album showed that Henley was both the most talented of  the Eagles and capable of a self reflection not previously seen in his  work.Sadly, those of us who are fans are going to have to wait for that  fourth solo album as the Eagles are getting back together to record another  album and tour once again proving that the public's infatuation with the  band is never ending."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tesla's debut album &quot;Mechanical Resonance&quot; blew me away. Rarely had I ever heard such a straight ahead, quality hard rock sound. Well, with this second effort the songs are every bit as good. Of course I love the radio songs--the top 10 quality (not cheesy) ballad &quot;Love Song&quot;, the also slower tempo but excellent &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, and the gritty &quot;Heaven's Trail (No Way Out)&quot;. However, every other song on this album RULES too! Like with the first album, I could rave about each and every track. &quot;Hang Tough&quot; is an awesome heavy start to the album, &quot;Lady Luck&quot; just screams with attitude, &quot;Lazy Days, Crazy Nights&quot; is a party rocker, and &quot;Paradise&quot; is just one amazing anthem with a great softer side but a very uptempo ending--a true masterpiece of a song. Anyone who likes straight ahead, heavy, and yet melodic rock and roll should definitely own this one. A truly underrated classic."}

Probably the best Cher from this period however, as &quot;Cher&quot;(with &quot;I Found Someone&quot;)and &quot;Love Hurts&quot; were slim on the hits. B+"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "For those who were introduced to Cher through her latest albums, &quot;Believe&quot; and &quot;Living Proof&quot;, &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; is probably the best of her &quot;middle period&quot; recordings.  You hear her rock soul on this set, and yet you get diversity from a sort of country parody (&quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot;), a kind of gospel rock number (&quot;Heart of Stone&quot;), something tender (The duet with Peter Cetera: &quot;After All&quot;), to the adult contemporary &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;.Along the way, you'll incidentally hear song writer Diane Warren at her very best.  She writes quite well for Cher in this album, with songs that lend themselves to Cher's dramatic and rather sardonic delivery.All in all, if you're a new Cher fan, I think you'll be pleased with this, and if you're an old Cher fan, you should already have it."}

Her first 2 albums are classics and her work since then has been inconsistent but usually very good however she hasd never been able to hit the high water mark of those first 2 albums.

{"label": 9, "raw": "Its great to see several cuts from NIGHT RIDE HOME featured on Joni'snew look back, &quot;THE BEGINNING OF SURVIVAL&quot;, (being releasedJuly 27th) . Although &quot;TurbulentIndigo&quot; received the Grammy and basically took itsblue print from &quot;NIGHT RIDE HOME&quot;, I really felt the warmthand devotion return with NRH, something I had missed from Joni's works over the years after Mingus. Although I really enjoyed Turbulent Indigo,Night Ride Home is special, moody, sad at times but itshows the real Joni Mitchell that overproduction sometimeshit with its colder touches(during the 80's). I still listened to everything Joni putout but this underappreciated collection of songs hit me just at a timein my life where I was reflecting about life and this musicfrom Joni really touched me. She's deeply spiritual, alwaysseeking answers yet always asking questions in her songs. I have listened to this over and over since its 1991 releaseand it still one of many Joni Mitchell classic favorites."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Night Ride Home was really a return for Joni Mitchell. She dropped almost all of the instruments that made her records released in the 80's sound so overproduced. There are more acoustic tracks who focus on Joni and her guitar. The lyrics are again from a very high level, like her albums from the 70's. Joni's voice has matured incredible and now you can hear that because of the sparse instrumentation. But that's not a complaint, because her voice sounds very cool and experienced by now. Absolute highlight of this album is Come In From The Cold, a song were Joni is looking back from the first time that she falls in love, to all the romance and relationships that have happened in her life. This is a great work from Joni Mitchell and if you love her more famous albums, you're gonna love this one also."}

My hand races out to pick it up in full anticipation of finding my favourite punk tune on there; \"spell bound\", and ugh!, I couldn't believe it.

{"label": 9, "raw": "Ooh...Lisa Loeb's first album 'Tails' is by far her best album.  I love the style.  Great rock with her vocals just seems unreal.  I never thought I'd find someone like Lisa Loeb but I did.  At first, I didn't want to give her a chance because her single 'Stay' was overplayed at the time and I wasn't into that kind of music.  YEARS later I decided to give her another try.  I'm so glad I did.  The songs are relatively simple but hold a lot of meaning and most people can relate to the lyrics.  I love 'Do You Sleep', 'Taffy' and 'Snow Day'.  It's a great album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Lisa Loeb's 1995 Tails album was very well anticipated after that 1994 megahit Stay.  It lived up to all the hype.  Very solid pop songs and excellent songwriting from Lisa.  She has managed to stay in the spotlight for a decade making very solid songs and albums that she chooses to do.  I wanted Do You Sleep to have the same kind of airplay and huge response that Stay did, keep that momentum going. Wanted it to go to No. 1 too, but it peaked at No. 18. Actually, adult contemporary stations liked that song more than the pop stations.  She rocks on several songs on the second half and takes no prisoners.  Loeb is one of the '90s best songwriters and this album proved that."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tails encapsulated the promise of Lisa Loeb, who made the big time with a hit single \"Stay\" off of the Reality Bites movie soundtrack.  The other hit off of the CD was \"Do You Sleep?\", but the other tracks off of the disc are well-written and executed, speaking of relationship perils of successes, sometimes with a sense of humour.  Lisa's star hasn't stayed as high since the release of this disc, but in part that's attributable to the change in the music landscape that occurred at the turn of the millennium, as MTV turned the pop culture sheep away from alternative rock and Lilith Fair music towards hip-hop, and (sadly) themselves away from playing videos and towards Punk'd.  Tails is definitely worth a listen, if you were a fan of music of that time."}

It took several listens for me to get hooked but once that happened I have found myself reaching for this CD to play almost everyday. I was acquainted with two of the songs from the radio years ago: 'Stay' and 'Do You Sleep?' but others are just as good if not better. 'Snow Day' is high energy and I often play air guitar when nobody is watching. I will definately look into buying her other CD."}

So I started pickin up used CD's when I could find them and was moving in a Lisa fan direction.  This one sealed the deal.  Smart musician, with a unique pocket.  She just got prettier....."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "gza of the wu tang clan releases a classic hip hop album with bad ass beats courtesy of the reliable producer,rza of the wu tang.the lyrics are intelligent and complex.the album starts off with &quot;liquid swords&quot;,which has a continuous bass line and gutitar that makes it a favorite of the album.thats rza's secret,throwing in unexpected beats that make his style one of a kind in the rap scene.from guitars to piano and even bombs going off are used.as usual members of the wu tang clan guest appear making the album more enjoyable.especially on the song &quot;4th chamber&quot; where ghostface killa,rza,and killa priest get down.other great tracks are,&quot;duel of the iron mic&quot;,&quot;living in the world today&quot; and &quot;i gotcha back&quot;.an excellent album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If there was any Wu-Tang member that could make a solid album between the 36 Chambers and Wu-Tang Forever era, it would be GZA. Every member of the Wu-Tang was talented and created in their own ways, but GZA knows how to make a phenomenal underground rap album. Unlike the majority of rap \"stars\" nowadays, GZA can craft excellent lyrics. The vintage kung fu sound clips also give it an extra step up. RZA did an excellent job in producing this album. With \"Liquid Swords\", GZA tells us how rap should be done: with meaningful lyrics, talent, distinctive vocal styles, and the soul of the Wu-Tang. A must own for the underground rap fan."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Wu-Tang Clan is definitely one of the weirdest and most hilarious rap groups that ever existed, but that's also what makes them one of the greatest. They have a great sense of humor (as seen in their awesome Kung-Fu movie interludes), and GZA/Genius is a funny-yet-great rapper. He's not my favorite, but he's very very good (he seems friendly even though what he's talking about sometimes isn't). The beats here are fantastic, though I'm not sure who the producer actually was (I'm 50% sure it was GZA/Genius himself). The lyrics are always interesting and occasionally pretty funny - you'll definitely love listening to it all. Basically, if you're a rap fan or if you already like the Wu-Tang Clan then you're going to LOVE this album! Highly recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This my favorite Wu Tang album.  It ditches the ultra-intense everybody-on-the-mic atmosphere of \"Enter The Wu Tang\" since the focus is squarely on GZA (despite numberous guest appearances from all Wu Tang Clan members)and replaces it with a creepy, even more subterranean feel.  This is some of RZA's darkest and heaviest production.  It fits perfectly with GZA's grim voice.  GZA always sounds threatening and scary but unlike the hyped up Ghostface Killah or macho-sounding Raekwon, The Genius portrays this with a laidback, creepily calm flow.  And great lyrics that are both streetwise and surprisingly complex.  Whether he's describing criminal fantasies, autobiographical slices of street life, or simply destroying rival MCs with battle rhymes, GZA sounds both wise and scary, kinda like an aging kung fu master who could kill you with his pinkie finger."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a CLASSIC. Right up there with Cuban Linx. What GZA lacks in persona he more than makes up for with his wicked intelligent deliveries. He exudes a veteran aura, someone who has been there an done that. GZA cuts right to the chase and gets down in the thick of it in this album. It has a dark and gloomy aesthetic feel to it, which I love. Yo, do yourself a favor and stop reading my review and just buy this sh**t. It is just as good now as it was back in '95...You won't regret it ;)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Now in my rap dictionary, this is probably the best Cd from any other Wu-Tang solo artist. Like hus name, GZA is a pure Genius when it comes to making a solid CD like \"Liquid Swords\". I can go through evry song on here, and not skip one track. Thats how much I liked it. No matter what genre of music you enjoy, you can appreciate it. You will never find a group and artits liek Wu-Tang Clan and GZA. This CD just shows how much better music was back in the early 90's and mid 90's. The next time you are looking for a classic Cd's by oen of the Wu-Tang members, and you dont have this Cd, tehn by it. You will be amazed of how well done this Cd was. There will never be one like it, ever again.peace"}

I am sure they are a fan of and a believer that Lil Flip LL or 50 or somebody like that is the greatest of all time. You know they believe in some false profit like that. Please put the flying guillotines away and know that some people are still analog. We Wu heads are too digital. In the words of Bobby Digital..That reminds me I need to write a review for that too. It gets no better than the first releases for the Wu."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "People are right, this cd is a classic but I only gave it four stars because some of the beats on here just do flow right with GZAs crazy insane lyrics he spits on every song. Another problem is that there are only thirteen songs which to me, that with any rapper is just way to little.GZAs' probably my favorite Wu-Tang mc lyrical wise along with Ghostface and Ol' This happened to be one of my first Wu-Tang purchases, and I have to say, it won't be the last."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The GZA is a lyrical swordsman. This guy says things that make you go back and think. This album, Liquid Swords, truly defines the classic Wu-Tang sound, just like the first Wu-Tang Clan album and the first Raekwon album before it. The GZA was at his absolute best on this album, and it shows in his lyrics. Here's the review:Album Highlights: The entire album.Production: Thumbs up. Once again, The Rza cooks up another production masterpiece.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: Other GZA albums after this have not lived up to this release. GZA released this at a good time in hip hop. Hip Hop music right now needs releases like this. Overall, this album is BRILLIANT. It's the classic Wu-Tang sound in all of its glory, and for that I strongly recommend that you purchase this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "While every Wu-Tang solo release is noteworthy for one reason or another, this flawless solo LP from GZA is of special note because, to my ears, it captures The RZA at a creative peak, soundwise. These tracks are truly atmospheric and deep, and there are, thankfully, no outside contributions, every track here is pure RZA. While Inspectah Deck has a great guest shot on my favorite track, \"Cold World\" (can't you just listen to this song 1,000 times?) this is entirely GZA's showcase and his intricate, brilliant wordplay, while somewhat measured in places, is stunning from start to finish. There is no filler here and the album doesn't overstay it's welcome, it's simply perfect. A hip-hop classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "one of the reasons I love rap is for the visuals that some rhymes put in my mind.. more rappers can't than can give me good visuals.. GZA is one of the best at doing that for me and he is just a great rapper.  It's dark and scary sounding while at the same time pure hip hop. And everybody who guested on the album gives great visuals as well.  This album has such an incredible vibe to it.. Plus, RZA did some of his best work on this album. the beats go with the rapping perfectly. if you like Wu-Tang clan, you need to get this/"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "When The Eagles broke up in the 1980's, two members landed outstanding solo projects. One of them was Don Henley. Actual Miles blends all three of his studio albums, into one great package. The songs feature his hits Sunset Grill, and The Heart Of The Matter. It also features three new tracks.The Garden Of Allah, is the so-called sequel to Hotel California. I thought it was even more frightening and enjoyable, than its prequel. You Don't Know Me At All brings classic rock and excitement in its depths of hard core Henley fanatics. Everybody Knows is a remake of a Lenord Cohen tune. This song was off the 1995 album Tower Of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen.While fans still look foward to his songs with The Eagles, Don Henley proved to break down the walls, and tell haunting and understanding stories of pop music in each of our lives. It is not the end of the innocence. It still is continuing on."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "White Zombie was/is one of the few 90's metal bands that I could actually listen to and enjoy. In an age of Pearl Jam and Sum 41, Rob Zombie along with Kid Rock and Metallica were pretty much the only options for 70's and 80's style music. White Zombie is super occult and sex minded with extremely racy lyrics that I cannot write here. If you want to get raucous, rawdy, and rebellious, NOTHING comes close to a good White Zombie album. Jam out to this in your car on a road trip or at a party. Zombie combines electronica, club, techno, and synth with CRUSHING metal jams. More Human than Human is just one example. Serious metal with an electronica twist! My favorite sounds ever!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First off, let me say just how much I LOVE the lay-out art work on this CD release (hubba-hubba!). They used several full color adult pin-ups from (would have to be)the late '60's era. I must also admit that I may like this disc better than I do their 'Astro-Creep: 2000' mostly because it has a diverse sound on just about every tune. Totally dug the after dark mix of \"Electric Head Pt. 2\", the raw mix of \"Grease Paint And Monkey Brains\" and the ass-kicking wine, women and song mix of \"Blood, Milk And Sky\" the most. Great compilation CD."}

Jerry & Doyle can actually play their instruments now and being backed by Dr. Chud's thundering drums and Michale Graves haunting screams really gives the band a great heavy, full sound.The stand-out songs are: \"Speak of the Devil\", \"Dig Up Her Bones\", \"Crimson Ghost\", \"Day of the Dead\" and \"Don't Open Til Doomsday\".Also, the hidden track \"Hell Night\" is pretty catchy.This is a great album in it's entirety, but the \"resurrected\" Misfits didn't really find their own sound until \"Famous Monsters\" which is definitely their best.Buy this album and prepare to shout along."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;American Psycho&quot; introduced the &quot;new&quot; version of the Misfits which included original bassist Jerry Only, longtime guitarist Doyle, and new members drummer Dr. Chud and singer Michale Graves.  Graves' voice bears a stunning resemblance to that of Glenn Danzig's, but the band as a whole suffers without Danzig's writing and musical talents.  However, &quot;American Psycho&quot; is much better than it is given credit for by longtime fans.  The album is chock full of catchy hooks and B-grade horror movie lyrics, and the rhythm section of the band has grown and Graves' voice sounds fantastic.  Standout tracks include the title track, &quot;From Hell They Came&quot;, &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;, &quot;Hate the Living, Love the Dead&quot;, and the excellent &quot;Dig Up Her Bones&quot;.  All in all, longtime fans may not dig &quot;American Psycho&quot; or any of the newer material bearing the Misfits name, but all together this is a solid album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This CD is definetely a must own for any Misfits fan/fiend/whatever. Released in 1997, this CD features classics such as \"Dig Up Her Bones\", \"Mars Attacks\", \"Shining\", and \"Black Light\". Okay, so Michale Graves' can't sing as well as Danzig. But, hey. Not many Punk vocalists can sing better than Danzig. Michale's aggressive howls and cries sound well blended in with sharply-tuned guitars and bass. The drums are also decent. Pick this one up along with Famous Monsters."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Planet P Project forgotten by most years ago thrives in today's music spectrum. Listen to the hip populist music of today... Radiohead, NIN, Coldplay, Remy Zero. Planet P belongs of this time. A concept album crafted and unique. Give it a try, I can assure you that you will spend a lot more for other discs that you will enjoy much less. This CD is best when listened to as a whole... while there were singles released in 1983 the songs form a journey that is best taken in the dark, cool, calm of night. Loaded with 80's fears of atomic wars and cold wars the work is somewhere between Floyd and Bowie....Give this a shot, you won't be let down."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "While many have compared Planet P Project to other prog rock bands one thing that still amazes me is how fresh the material still sounds ! Carey was able to produce an album that could convey a space or futuristic rock theme without relying on pure cold synthesized gimmickry that was prevalent in the early 80's. It's awesome 80's early rock;pure and simple. On the whole this is one album that has been a favorite of mine all these years due to it's atmospheric and rich-hook laden lyrics and musicianship. Fans of Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, and even Enigma may be quite intrigued by this now 20 year old release with one of it's most captivating early MTV videos of Why Me ?..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I had to get this CD again, after first having had it on vinyl well over a decade ago.Believe it or not, I can remember well a number of the tracks, despite not having heard them this whole time.'Static' in  particular sticks out for me.  A haunting rendition of moody,  post-holocaust science fiction, one can almost feel the desolation in the  atmosphere.  If you ever have to contemplate nuclear war and its mind  boggling aftermath, you should do so while listening to this song!Just  thinking of Planet P Project gets my creative imaginative juices flowing.  I used to curl up with a good science fiction novel with this on the  stereo-- and nothing has been quite the same since."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Something brilliant. That's exactly what happens when you turn Cher into nothing short of a rock Goddess, and mix her with Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and Desmond Child. Aswell as these HOT producers, there's also production from Michael Bolton, Peter Asher and Jon Lind. This is honestly one of Cher's best ever albums. All of the tracks are brilliant, but my favourites are obviously the ones produced by Jon, Richie and Desmond!! (We All Sleep Alone, which is my favourite Cher song ever, Bang-Bang, Main Man, Give Our Love A Fightin' Chance, Perfection and Working Girl, though I really like I Found Someone, too!) I love them all! :)I think her later work is also great (Believe, Living Proof, etc...), though she should've stuck to Jon, Richie and Desmond! ;)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "My favoutite albums by Cher are her Geffen-albums, made between 1987 and 1992. It's this one, &quot;Heart Of Stone&quot; and &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (and the &quot;Greatest Hits 1956-1992&quot;, containing three new songs).  If you like any of the songs you've heard from these albums, you should buy  all of them, because they are great. They sound quite the same, but are  still, by some reason, very different. Diane Warren, Desmond, Child, Jon  Bon Jovi and Michael Bolton have written many of the songs on these albums  and they are great songwriters.  Buy this album, you'll love it! I like the  guita solos (some of them by Steve Lukather (Toto) or Richie Sambora (Bon  Jovi))."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd heralds a few choice cuts. They include &quot;We All Sleep  Alone&quot;, and &quot;Dangerous Times&quot;. Here Cher is moving and  dramatic. Her second two lps on Geffen were superior though, and &quot;Skin  Deep&quot; and &quot;Working Girl&quot;, are compositions that should never  have been selected. Cher has improved as a singer since this cd.Some will  love it for the hit &quot; I Found Someone&quot;, penned by Michael Bolton,  origional version by Laura Branigan. Cher cut the hit though.Not a bad  listen but Cher can be better.Chers first version of &quot;Bang Bang&quot;,  is much better in its' Sonny Bono Harold Battiste production. This one is  garish and hard."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Outrider was disappointing, and preceded the re-release of the Led Zep masters.  The story goes that Jimmy Page's master tapes for a double or triple album were stolen from his home - leading him to recompose this effort.  The basic idea of doing three styles - hard rock, instrumental and blues are here - and the blues numbers are the best.  But the guitar work is strangely bland.  As one reviewer puts it, this is an uneven work.  Plant's improvised &quot;The Only One&quot; doesn't do anything and John Miles - the vocalist - would do a far better job singing live on tour with Page.  The album also sounds too clean.  No grit whatsoever.  I rate this 2 and a half stars...."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Man! can you belive the price? Jimmy toured on this lp. And it wasgreat! The opening song was WASTING MY TIME. Sad though thateverything he does is compared to Zeppelin:-( Three instramentals included. Robert pops in on THE ONLY ONE. Good job Bob! PRISON BLUES starts off with a wicked overdriven blues riff that just screams all the way through to the other side of your skull,man!  HUMMINGBIRD is light mix radio stuff. BLUES ANTHEM is probably the only song ever by Jimmy I dare call boring. After the FIRM (who were great!) and before COVERDALE.(also great!)  OUTRIDER stands on it's own as testament to a man &amp; his guitar, against the world!  Still cant belive the price? Should be $18.00 or more. Get it now before they get wise! Only question Jimmy,Who cut your hair,man?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "With OUTRIDER, Mr Jimmy Page releases the album fans during the seventies always wanted but never received.  This is a Blue's Guitar Album.  WASTING MY TIME and PRISON BLUES draw from the hard rock well of the early days.  And why not?  It was Mr Page who dug that well.  The production quality is what you would expect, that is, something better than anyone else can do.  Robert Plant, Jason Bonham as well as the &quot;guitar orchestra&quot; make appearances.  If you are interested in hearing a Blue's Guitar album from Mr Page, this CD will interest you."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "i'll make this short and sweet...this album is amazing.  ...i'll take you back to '84.  new music was growing...Valley Girl...that movie with the fanatstic soundtrack...the plimsouls &quot;million miles away&quot; jammin in the bar scene.  i was sold.  the ultimate record from the early eighties that still reigns true today.  great words...great music...great production...yet the sting of that pure raw garage band sound.  simply put?  get the CD...you'll thank me when you do.  as soon as you hear &quot;oldest story in the world&quot;, you'll thank me again.  i thank peter case everytime i jam...everywhere at once."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Originally released in 1983, who could honestly forget this fun-to-listen-to new wave, power pop, alternative (call it what you like) band? Guess they disbanded after this record came out. Never one of my favorites but I remember this lp on the turntable at several college parties I hung out at back then. Tunes here I found to my liking were \"Shaky City\", the catchy \"Lie, Beg, Borrow And Steal\", their unforgettable 'signature' song {if you care to call it that} \"A Million Miles Away\", \"My Life Ain't Easy\", \"I'll Get Lucky\" and the surf guitar-like closer \"Hobo\". Nice! Followers of the Romantics, Goo Goo Dolls, The dB's and The Knack should really enjoy this reissue."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought this album waaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1996 when I was still a college student and it quickly became one of my favorite CDs ever.  The style goes from bouncy quick ska-punk (Sunday Morning) to cute gimmick song (Just A Girl) to mature wistfulness (Don't Speak) and all the way back again.  No Doubt are certainly talented artists.  I had the privilege of seeing No Doubt play live at RockFest in Texas in 1997 and I was absolutely blown away.  They aren't one of those canned studio acts that sound [bad] live....they really rock."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt is highly overrated. The songs released were pretty good but after all these years, this album is dated and annoying now. This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular, no wonder they had to change their sound after this album. Don't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it. The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning, great hook and chorus. This album is considered their masterpiece, but I've heard better."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought this album after hearing (and loving)&quot;Spiderwebs&quot; and &quot;Don't Speak&quot; on the radio. I fell in love with it the first time I heard it. The only song that is not too good is &quot;World Go Round&quot;, but all the other songs are just too good to drag the record along. My other faves on the album include &quot;Sixteen&quot;, &quot;Different People&quot; and the title track. Sadly, thier other albums can't compare to this one. If you only buy one No Doubt album, this is it! This is one of the best CD's I own (Melanie B.'s &quot;Hot&quot; is the other)and I absolutely adore it. Get ready for a great ride through a &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;!!:)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tragic Kingdome seems like the most hyped recording by No Doubt.  With all those singles:  Don't Speak, Spiderwebs, Sunday Morning, etc.... I thought that this CD would be a classic.  Somehow, it is not.The thing is that in addition to the five singles there are ten other tracks.  And many of them just do not do anything special for me.  I think the hooks are less memorable as on Rock Steady and The Beacon Street Collection.  Sixteen is an exception as its a fairly catchy new wave rock tune. Different People has a nice jazzy beat to it with good horn arrangements.  And the title track has some interesting textures to its style.Therefore I count the recording as about a fifty fifty split between good songs and nothing special ones.  Therefore three stars seems like the right rating."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No Doubt's TRAGIC KINGDOM is a classic album from the mid 90s. It has a unique sound that no one else was making at the time. There is a unique mix of reggae, punk, and pop found on this album. I remember how huge it was at the time. It has really aged well...10 years on and it's still a very listenable album. Singles included \"Just A Girl\", \"Spiderwebs\", \"Sunday Morning\", \"Don't Speak\", and \"Excuse Me Mister\". The album has a whole is great and there is no filler! Classic!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No Doubt is one of the few bands who improves with each album.! Gwens vocals are far less whiny on this album,and the lyrics are more serious then their debut.!Althou their debut was a flop for them I *Love* it you should check that out as well.!This album spawned such major hits as &quot;Don't Speak&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, and &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;.!Which brought this ska band to super stardon they sold over 10 million copies of this album.! I bought this album without hearing a single song from it.!And I am proud to say I was NOT disapointed it is actually a good album.!If you are looking for something that is not over produced and more original then Britney Spears then check out No Doubt's &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;!!! The best songs here are &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Don't Speak&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Excuse me Mr.&quot;, &quot;Sweet 16&quot;, and &quot;Different People&quot;.!But that's just my opinions!!!Just check out this album!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album made NxD famous. It made Gwen Stefani into a star.The first four tracks on the album set the scene. The whole album is represented by those tracks.The rest of the album is amazing, but some of the songs go over your head. But that just gives this album more replay value.I hope NxD release their new album soon. Till then fans, myself included, have \"Tragic Kingdom\" and the acclaimed \"Rock Steady\" to tide them over.Favorite tracks: \"Spiderwebs,\" \"Excuse Me Mr.\" \"Just a Girl,\" \"Happy Now?\" \"Sunday Morning,\" \"Don't Speak\""}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of my favourite albums of all time. The themes are consistent through-out the entire album, and references to DisneyLand are hidden through out. This is one of those cds you should have on a top 200 basis, especially if you love 90's music. The singles on this album are superb, but even the non-single tracks are awesome. The title track is epic. Also good are Happy Now, End it On This and World Go Round. Classic Ska, Classic 90's, and just good stuff all around."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd, which richly deserved its diamond status, brought ska and No Doubt to the peak of popularity.  While the ska fever has died down, this album and band remain vital in the music scene.  This album is, for the most part, a happy affair.  Gwen Stefani is for this band what Christine McVie is for Fleetwood Mac, someone who can make bouncy songs even about depressing subjects.  Anyway, this album is fantastic.  The title track descends into a cacaphony of clashing instruments, and other tracks, such as &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; and &quot;The Climb&quot; are also spectacular.  If you don't own this album now, what are you waiting for?  Buy it, listen to it, and love it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I just love Tragic Kingdom it has to be the best No Doubt album to date. It has four great singles Spiderweb, Just A Girl, Sunday Morning, and Don't Speak. This has to be the best album of the 90's and of '95 if you ask me. The whole album is a true rock album so don't think twice about getting this album because you might just miss out on a great thing. If you are looking for a great rock album it has to be No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom. Put this one in your collection today or you might miss out on a real true rock album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of the best CD's I have. But I think that they did a better job at their new album, return of saturn. Tragic Kingdom was released in 1995, and now it is 2001, so people still listen to their 6 year ago songs. NO DOUBT'S SONGS NEVER GET OLD!!!!!!THIS BAND ROCKS!!!!!!!I just keep loving their songs more and more and more,,,,and I am sure that I will still keep listening to TRAGIC KINGDOM EVEN IF I HAD IT FOR 6 YEARS NOW....  You are doing great guys....KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK!!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "My favorite singer of all-time flourishes with this piece of Latin history called AMOR PROHIBIDO.  Her most recognized Tejano recording boasts charming pop/Latin tracks like &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; and Selena's very own penned &quot;Bidi Bidi Bom Bom&quot;, and the ballady &quot;No Me Queda Mas&quot;.  I give this album 5 out of 5 stars because it shines poignantly like no other of Selena's Latin CDs!  It's not hard to guess why Selena would've been up there with the likes of Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin.  This is a Classic and a MUST BUY in my mind - and I'm not even Hispanic!  She rules."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First of all I love this CD to death. My favorite track is Ya No number 10 because it shows her rock side of her but the whole album is my favorite there is not one bad track on this album and she explores with different sounds with this album compares to her others. She was just so funky with this album and you can tell how much hard work her and the band put into it. They had four number one singles from this album Amor Prohibido, Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, No Me Queda Mas and Fotos Y Recuerdos (Back In The Chain Gang). It was well produce and just a great album to listen to from start to finish so if you are getting into Selena this would be a good place to start to get to know what she did before her death because it shows you where she could of gone in the Latin Market."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "With some exceptions, I think TD's music from the 70's is horrible. But not all of it. Ricochet is good and the song Green Desert I still think stands as one of their best. By my standards, Hyperborea is one of the best things they ever did. The sound is lucid and not a jumble of crazy, unrelated noises like I have experienced on some of their other recordings. Christopher Franke was still with the band and for my money, Tangerine Dream was one half Froese and one half Franke. The songs on this CD move well and are truly creative and original although you still have the same distinctive sound. With Franke gone TD is just not what it used to be. Every song here is good and the 20 minute \"Sphinx Lightning\" is the kind of stuff Tangerine Dreams are made of. The gradual changing of rhythms on this album is what makes it unique. Hyperborea, from 1983, still has to be one of their best."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This overrated album doesn`t do much for me. I don`t really see what`s so special about it, and I believe it`s the band`s worse record. The title song is a good opener, and &quot;Karmakoma&quot; is a great moment as well, but after the third track, &quot;Three&quot;, it all goes downhill and turns into an average and bland trip-hop/ downtempo record. The last song, a cover of &quot;Light my fire&quot;, is particularly weak and just puts me away.A disappointig and souless album, &quot;Protection&quot; is alright as background music, but not much else."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "When I first heard this cd I was blown away. I love everything on it  except the Doors cover. The beats are fresh. The bass is thick. The layers  are perfect. Tracy Thorn has become one of my favorite singers because of  this record. It really made me re-evaluate where my music was going. In a  time when people swore grunge was the future of music these cats were  playing it ultra cool. In the question of 5 cd's I would take if stuck on a  desert island this would make the cut without thinking."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Massive Attack has paved the way for all trip-hoppers and electronica artists.  They masterfully out-do themselves on every album (with their best album therefore being Mezzanine) and with slow songs, gradual climaxes, and heavy beats, its irresistable to an electronica fan.  There is no question that the best song on the album they put first, the title track, Protection.  Its a sweet song, with tracey thorn's smooth vocals (I cant change the way you feel, but i can put my arms around you) with a great guitar riff and the classic massive attack beats, at more than 6 minutes long.  No downtempo collection is complete without at least one massive attack record- and the rest of the album is pretty good- but the whole album is worth it for just that one song."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of my favorite albums of all time!! Scarface first solo album with no guest appearances (how many mc's can say that??). If you think you know hardcore hip-hop and u don't own this album.....WHERE HAVE U BEEN!!!The beats are so dark and hard that it would bury the average \"gangsta rapper\" trying to flow over them. But put that boy Brad (Scarface) up to the task and he tames them. Every song (yes i mean every) is a must listen. There are no interludes or shout out trks on here to be found. This is not just mindless \"gangsta rap\" this is Harcore Hip-hop at its finest..Hotep!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is real tight.I decided to buy this album because I heard the Luniz on my homie Dru Downs album explict game, back in 94'.I liked they rap so I got this joint, and I wasn't disappointed either.I mean the Luniz ain't as good as Dru Down but they good enough to listen to.This album features  Dru Down,Richie Rich,Shock G and others.The Beats on this joint is real tight nice and smooth grooves to ride to.The lyrics is what separates the Luniz from anybody else in the rap game thoy.Them fools be saying the funniest stuff you can think of and they just make it sound real tight in they street based raps.So if you like WestCoast music like me you'll like this and if you wanna get a good laugh this the one for you too no doubt."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I got 5 on it. Every one knows that songs. I got this when I was heavey on the bay sound in 95. This album is the bomb and its kind of funny to, because of the slangs words they use and their clever wordplay. Just listen to song 13 where they use the barney songs chourus lyrics. THey have pimp songs,dance songs, smoke songs. I like song 6 the best ,its smooth. This is the begging of yukmouths career he went solo after the luniz broke up and he hot. He isnt a to comical now though  he is more  gangsata now. Check him out also. Get the luniz too."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The Luniz debut album is a classic gangsta-rap album at gangsta-rap prime times. It's 2001 and I still like listening to it. So... I think it's off the hook! Maybe this ain't a well-planned album but that ain't a point of gangsta-rap. It's about repping the OAK on their G-level. Some people may know them from 'I got 5 on it' but there's much way better tracks on the album. I don't wanna dis' 'I got 5 on it' cuz that rtack a WestCoast classic but there's songs with better lyrics.  But I can admit that I really nod my head on \"I got 5 on it (+ the Reprise)\" and \"5150\", too. In addition, I can't dis' the Luniz 1st album in no way! That's a classic and everybody should'a admit it! Told: 5-stars!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "When I saw the band name Sneaker Pimps I thought to myself who would name their band this? I was listening to \"Six Underground\" the very 1st song I ever heard and I liked it so I listened to more of the music and I thought to myself not bad.  Kelli Dayton has a very soulful voice yet a bit to edgy, I am not saying shes bad but sometimes she sounds like a kid. Shes a good singer though. Chris Corner and Liam Howe wrote some very good songs.Chris Corner is a better singer then Kelli Dayton, I mean dont get me wrong shes great but Corner was a bit better, this is a alright album so I gave it a 3."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was a breath of fresh air in 1997. The Sneaker Pimps are the awkward cousins of Garbage and the neighbors of Everything But The Girl, and as they march toward their latest release Blood Sport, they come with pretty decent material under their belt. Becoming X is a smooth, ambient-laced odyssey that at times seems so right and others just unnecessary and too sleepy for its own good. The best stuff is at the top of the disc: \"Low Place Like Home\", \"Tesko Suicide\", \"Six Underground\", and the title track. They all have their own charm though, mixing a punky attitude in some places, folky guitar in some, and Nyquil-ish trance in the others. One of those albums that starts off great and loses steam toward the end. Worth purchasing for the mentioned songs, and a few other elements. Maybe the electronic boom is passing. Who knows? Maybe Blood Sport and Moby's upcoming 18 can save the rave."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This would probably be a desert island top five album for me. It can literaly put you in a trance. I have not heard another album like this ever. They call it \"trip-hop\" but it's pretty much extremely well written dance-house music with a one of a kind vocalist. I fell in love with Kelli Deyton just from listening to this album one time. She has a very young and innocent sounding voice but at the same time she's singing these brilliant, sophisticated, troubled, and hurt lyrics, It makes for a VERY sexy sound. This is one of those albums that I never get tired of no matter how many times I listen to it. Chris Corner's song writting and Kelli Deyton's voice truly make for a one of a kind sound. If I had to compare them to one other band I would probably say Portishead but the Sneaker pimps are much, much better!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "\"Becoming X\" sounds like the trip-hop of a cold, advanced tech future with an approaching apocalypse. Yet, the music slightly glows with a human factor.Founded by Chris Corner(guitar) and Liam Howel(synth), The Sneaker Pimps released this debut record back in 1996, with amazing production from Line of Flight and Jim Abbiss. This is also the only Sneaker Pimps album where Kelli Dayton(later known as Kelli Ali through her solo career) lends her spunky vocals...and it contributes greatly to the attitude of \"Becoming X\".The album spawned two successful singles. `6 Underground' is a dreamy down-tempo techno-pop song that drove the success of the album. `Spin Spin Sugar' is fast, chaotic, bass-driven trip-hop that could fuel fire. However, every track on this record is great.`Becoming X' is one of my favorite electronica/trip-hop albums. I wish The Sneaker Pimps would've made more albums with Kelli Dayton, because magic happens!5 Stars!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a fun record... anyone buying this record looking for salvation will probably be disappointed, but if you want a fun, funky, dance record, then this is it... I love it personally, and it always hypes me up when I listen to it... just listen to the wicked... beats on Revolution 909, the soothing waves on Fresh, the funky bass of Around the World, the discoy feel of High Fidelity... it's great fun, and if you like dance music, you need this in your collection... if you like music you need it, for some variety... it's great fun, pick it up..."}

The beats were fun and maybe it was just the crazy video for &quot;Around The World&quot; that got me interested.  But enough is enough.  In &quot;Da Funk&quot;, how many times can you hear that one riff before your head explodes or you just have to turn it off?  Give me a break.  They have some good reiffs going, now they just need to get the rest of the songs going."}

Check it out when ya fry, (call a radiostation and ask if they will play Daft Punk's Around The World). I say 100% of this album is good. Any questions e-mail me at yuckplace@hotmail.com ."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First of all, if you are new to Daft Punk, mostly because of Random Access Memories or the Tron: Legacy soundtrack and looking for more of there music; and you are not otherwise into electronica /house/techno, this is not a good place for you to start.  Your next album should probably be Discovery, as that's the closest thing to DP's more recent work in there back catalog.  If you can't get into that, you'd be advised to just stop there.This debut album is really early-- 1997, actually-- and is hard core club music: very loopy, very repetitive and mostly made to dance to.  And very electronic.  That is not to say that it lacks depth, however.  Active listening reveals many surprises and subtleties that make trancing out to it a great experience.  So if you like good electronic music, this needs to be in your collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No matter what controversy Paula Abdul tends to generate these days, there used to be a time when she was much more well-respected, and rightly so with this high-energy, hits-heavy album. \"Straight Up\" and \"Forever Your Girl\" are two songs that really say \"bring back the 80s\". A lot of people said that she had no singing talent, and while I can agree on the fact that her whiny, nasal wail is not the most pleasant singing voice that somebody could've been blessed with, she still knows how to sing with energy and passion."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Ahhh... it's amazing what we think is cool when we are 14, eh? Just listening to this CD now in 2000 is like listening to a soundtrack of junior high. Back then, it was a fierce R&amp;B-tinged pop album with  strong rhythms and excellent production; today, it's more of a  paint-by-numbers wafer-thin voice warbling over a drum track. No one ever  called Paula Abdul a great singer -- sometimes it gets so bad, it sounds  like she is singing underwater -- but at times, the production here *is*  top-notch. &quot;Cold Hearted&quot; and &quot;Knocked Out&quot; are simply  two good-sounding, danceable songs. Verdict? Dated lightweight pop that's  just fun, with no real substance -- just like eating frosting right out of  the tub."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "After 7's debut disc was released at time when almost every R&B record released was A-1.Two-thirds of the trio are the brothers of producer Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, and the other third is the cousin of Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid; the two produced the majority of the album, which features three smash hits and a host of other likable tracks. The singles released were Heat Of The Moment, Can't Stop and Ready Or Not. Can't Stop & Heat Of The Moment were both up-tempo dance numbers while Ready Or Not is one of the best slow jams released in 1989. However the one song to me that makes the CD a classic is \"One Night,\" an urban adult contemporary composition that was never released; it showcases Melvin and Kevon in an impressive vocal exchange over a mid-tempo rhythm."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A nice opening salvo in the Afro-Brit invasion; too bad that it never materialized as strongly as promised.  Still, this CD manages to hit all of the high notes while, for the most part, avoiding too many cliches along the way.  Some songs hold up much better than others over time - \"Back to Life\" and \"Fairplay\" are two good examples.  Some songs were good for the time, but now ound dated - \"Dance\" and \"Jazzie's groove;\"  others, like \"Feel Free\" are embarasments.  The rest of the disc is okay, but I have serious issues with whoever decided to put \"Dance\" and \"African Dance\" - two versions of the same song- back to back with each other."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was the last Camper Van Beethoven album before leader David Lowery  split with the band and went on to form the more conventional band Cracker.  &quot;Key Lime Pie&quot; is musically quite ambitious and makes good use  of a full time violinist, particularly on the ace cover song &quot;Pictures  of Matchstick Men.&quot;  Other CVB classics that inhabit this album  include the brilliant Ronald Reagan satire &quot;Sweethearts,&quot; the  wistful &quot;When I Win the Lottery&quot; and the brilliantly corny  &quot;All Her Favorite Fruit.&quot;  Not everything works, however, and  overall the album is of uneven quality.  Still, there's enough great songs  to make it worth your while."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of those bands that I can simply not compare to anyone. But sometimes those are the best ones. It's a great album from my senior year, that is probably better than I can put into words. My favorite song is &quot;Sweethearts&quot;. It's just got great guitar work, and an overall happy strummin' melody. Violin adds alot to many of these songs as well, especially on the great track &quot;Pictures Of Matchstick Men&quot;. They do it very well. Other cool songs are &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;All Her Favorite Fruit&quot;. After this album, &quot;David Lowery&quot; went on to do &quot;Cracker&quot;, and I think &quot;Morgan Fichter&quot; worked some with &quot;10,000 Maniacs&quot; and &quot;Jane's Addiction&quot;. But overall, not much satisfies like &quot;Key Lime Pie&quot;."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Break up albums have that distinct charm of not caring that allows one to relax and bare their soul.  It also finds bands gripping at something they once had but not quite reaching it.  Like the Smiths &quot;Strangeways Here We Come&quot;, another good breakup album, there are good tracks and forgettable material alike.Their political side is highlighted in the mysterious &quot;Jack Ruby&quot;.  &quot;Laundromat&quot; rocks and contains one of their best lines : &quot;Just give me some tension release.&quot;  Their are some nice moments on side two.  The uplifting spring heralding &quot;June&quot;, and the lovelorn &quot;All Her Favorite Fruit&quot;.  I do enjoy this album, but there is  an inconsistency to it that just makes me want for more."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's very easy to call this album \"boring\" in comparison to the rest of the band's catalog, but it's not to be written off. Gone is the experimental stuff, and for the most part so is the goofy sense of humor and eclecticism, but what's left is some well-written clever pop. Imagine a Cracker album but with some mideastern violins once in a while, and you've got the picture. It's a bit heavy on the slow songs, so when there's the rare one that's a little less than excellent things can start to drag, but most of them are beautiful, and songs like \"I Was Born In A Laundromat\" and their cover of Status Quo's \"Pictures Of Matchstick Men\" manage to punch things up at just the right places. While I'd reccomend Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart over this for a first purchase (it's as accessible, but done with a lot more creativity), it's still a very solid album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Good late '80's independent college rock title. Camper Van Beethoven has never been one of my favorites but I've always liked their name. As fate would have it, I got to catch them at a special radio station show play a club for like $1.05. This being CVB's fifth CD, it's the title of theirs that I do like the best. Tracks that are always nice to hear again {whenever I pull this disc} out for a spin are the edgy \"Jack Ruby\", \"When I Win The Lottery\", \"All Her Favorite Fruit\" and their superbly done cover of Status Quo's \"Pictures Of Matchstick Men\". Got to hang out with their violinist Morgan Fichter after the show. Also saw her like a couple of years later on tour with Jane's Addiction. Pretty sure that was her."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I got a chance to see Julia live in 1994, and the concert she gave still  ranks in my all time top 10 that I have been at. This is the CD that got me  started with Julia. I was familiar with Happy Ever After from the video,  but Porcelain is much better than her first release. I think that  Porcelain, Falling Forward and East-West are all pretty damn good and rate  5 stars each.  She got a lot more air play and video play 10 years ago. I  wonder why she fell out of favor with VH1?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Maybe not so much now, but when this album came out Lenny was the man! If \"5\" isn't his most popular album, this is. The title track and video was everywhere, rightly so. I like the first two albums a bit more, but this is still solid. \"Believe\" was another cool single, and I really think \"Heaven Help\" is a smooth song. No hits in the back of this album, but I still think it's almost as strong as the first half. I think the following album Circus was good too, but this was so huge it made Circus seem like it failed. Anyway, groovy album man."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "to me this is his best album and where he was making a statement. the title  track alone  made him appear to be on to bigger and Brighter things. musically he continued what he had started on his first couple of albums and just fleshed it out more. he always wore his Influences  and Heroes on his sleeves left and right, however he was on point with this album.  this set has rare outtakes and interview and other rare things on it.  his music Collaborator  Craig Ross held it down on guitar and Cindy Blackmon threw down on drums. back then Lenny  had a tough band behind him. he started to find a groove on this album and while his 5th album blew him up, to me this is his best album and to me he never reached those heights of where he was going quite again, however this album worked real good for  him as a  Artist."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Are You Gonna Go My Way firmly established Lenny Kravitz as a major rock star.  With the alt-rock scene at its peak in 1993, Mr. Kravitz's straight ahead rock sound stood out from the crowd.  Although he has been criticized for mimicking the sounds of artists like The Beatles, Sly Stone, Led Zeppelin and others, he plays his music with reverence towards his influences.  He takes those sounds and makes them his own.  The title track opens the album up and it is a cacophony of wicked guitar riffs, sledgehammer drums, pulsating bass and powerhouse vocals.  A truly great rock song.  &quot;Believe&quot; is an airy, mystical number while &quot;Black Girl&quot; is a funky come on.  &quot;Sugar&quot; is a stellar track as &quot;Just Be A Woman&quot;.  Are You Gonna Go My Way is a top notch effort."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's a shame 'cause Depeche Mode used to be such a great band - it was even THE band back in my gymnasium times.What a pity to release such a sleepy album. The instrumentation on 'Ultra' is pretty inventive but most of the songs do lack positivity and maybe even musical willingness. You simply get sleepy, 'cause they're all in the same far too slow atmosphere.Especially the hit single 'Barrel Of A Gun' is embarrassingly boring. Not worth the former Depeche Mode quality stamp.Only highlights are 'It's No Good' which COULD make it to a 'Best Of' compilation, and 'Freestate', especially its crispy guitar.Depeche Mode needs to work on this adjusted style. It can work. But it'll TAKE some work!A big compliment though for sending 'Ultra' out on vinyl too!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Ultra was their first post Wilder album and whilst it is not as good as Exciter it is the most inspired work that DM had created for quite some time. Songs like home, sister of night and bottom line all show what Fletcher, Gore and Gahan are capeable alone and without the dominering attitude of Alan Wilder. It was also the first time that they had employed outside artists to play on their records and the end result is quite amazing. They needed new blood and the idea to have outside artists come in and help with the recording is a stroke of genius. Dave Gahans vocals are not as good as on Exciter but they are much better then on SOFAD. This is an awesome synth pop album that should not be missed."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Seriously.  Just crank that puppy, and thrill to the way its glorious swooping bassline makes your subwoofer earn its living, and to the way it glides from DM's trademark minor key into major and back again, and to the way that it all just sounds so effortless.It clearly wasn't, of course.  These guys (now minus Alan Wilder) went through some well-publicized ugly times to get to the point that they were able to pull off _Ultra_ -- but they also managed to move beyond the stifling cynicism of _Songs of Faith and Devotion_ and come up with something catchy, cathartic, and occasionally quite moving.  I'd rank it right up there with _Violator_, _Black Celebration_, and (if I may plug a largely overlooked personal favorite) Mesh's _Who Watches Over Me?_ among the best albums ever released within its genre."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;Ultra&quot; is the difficult album that Depeche Mode made after the drug-addiction period that lead singer Dave Gahan went through and the absence of former band member Alan Wilder. Despite the changes that the band suffered, this is still a great return and a very worthwile record, focusing the group in an exciting creative moment.&quot;Ultra&quot; has a dark, contemplative, nocturne feel to it, presenting deep and complex songs that may take awhile to get into. Gahan`s vocals are better than ever, the electronic elements are contemporany without being too edgy and are not used in a way that makes them the dominant component of the songs. Most of the moments here are obscure and atmospheric ballads with powerful, creative songwriting and mature lyrics. The singles &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and &quot;Useless&quot; are three of the best pieces of the album, an example of the band`s strenght and genious. All in all, this is one of Depeche Mode`s best records, and that is saying a lot. Impressive and addictive."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "As far as pop music is concerned, Depeche Mode is one of my favotites (The Pet Shop Boys is my other favorite).  Ever since Black Celebration (i am not a big fan of their earlier material) they have been creating great  songs with memorable music and good, at times very dark lyrics.  Although  many songs on this CD  have a sad tone, most  of them have positive themes  like hope,love, and gratitude.  Occasional touches of electronica are nice  too."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I had never heard of Depeche Mode before &quot;It's No Good&quot; was  released. At first, i felt that David Gahan was a Bono look-alike, and his  voice just sounded like every other brit-pop star. After awhile I decided  to listen to the whole album. I fell in love with the dark yet danceable  sound of &quot;Barrel of a gun&quot; and the gothic sounds of &quot;The  Love Thieves&quot; and &quot;Sister of Night.&quot; &quot;Freestate&quot;  is an exceptional track, but the whole album could really kick Robert  Smith's ass (though I am a big-time Cure fan too). Put simply, this is  Depeche Mode at their best."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It seems after all these years, DM is finally comfortable.  That is what this CD conveys.  There aren't many tracks that would pack a club floor.  The mix is phat but minimal, almost stark.  The campiness is gone.  They have progressed from the old school analog synths, to more rich, complex, and deep sounds and percussion, fusing it all together with soothing vocals and harmonies.  Growth.  Experience.  Life.  These are the ingredients of Ultra.My favorites:  &quot;Barrel Of A Gun&quot;/&quot;The Love Thieves&quot;/&quot;Home&quot;/&quot;It's No Good&quot;/&quot;Useless&quot;/&quot;Sister Of Night&quot;/&quot;The Bottom Line&quot;/&quot;Insight.&quot;Other cool bands:  De/Vision, Distain!, Agnes Poetry, Iris."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This along with \"Criss-Cross\" have been roundly acknowledged as among the best the Monk has ever done.  Considering he had recorded dozens of albums, that's no small praise either.  This version of the classic album is a work of art in itself.  The mini-lp sleeve replica is very well done and it reproduces very faithfully the cover art on the original lp release.  In addition, all the tracks have been very well digitally remastered so that the sound quality is really very, very good.  This is by far the best version of this album that is currently out there.Recommended for all fans of Monk and of great jazz in general."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "On Brilliant Corners, the music was as challenging as anything he had done in the past, but now the public seemed to be ready for what he was doing. Many consider this the album to be a masterpiece, and rightly so. Max Roach's drumming on the title track sounds great--tight, and full of impact. &quot;Pannonica&quot; made its debut on this album, and features Monk on both piano and celeste at the same time. Originally recorded on the spur of the moment to fill space on the album, the tender &quot;I Surrender, Dear&quot; sounds like you're right there in the studio. &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; is a bit sloppy, but Roach's tympani playing stands out much more than it did on the OJC version. The only problem I noticed here is a click at the beginning of the title track. Aside from that, it sounds fabulous."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a very nice blow session, recorded almost 9 months after the extremely popular Somethin' Else.  Unlike the earlier album, this one is definitely a Cannonball album in style.  Unlike many later albums, this is a blowing session rather than a studio appearance by a live, working band.I'll admit to being lukewarm on Milt Jackson and my judgment of this album is probably affected downward as a result.  Milt's playing is nice here, just not anything that sets me on edge.Like a lot of Cannonball albums from this period, there is a healthy mix of ballads (\"Serves Me Right\"), bebop (\"Groovin' High\"), interesting originals (\"Blues Oriental\" by Milt Jackson) and extremely funky material (\"Sounds for Sid\").  Not a spectacular achievement but a very good one.  Fans of Cannonball's 50s playing will find a lot to enjoy here."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "On a shopping spree, I bought this one, speak no evil and maiden voyage. Well, after listening to all three, this one just stay in my cd player. Some of the best music ever recorded in any kind of music. Beware: it was recorded by Mingus on a portable equipment. The sound quality is not for this age of 2000 bit digitally remastered. Sometimes the players are recorded at differnet volumes throughout the album. But dont let that prevent you from listening to this amazing, work of art. If No Parker, no Miles, no Coltrane, no Mingus, etc."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd is an amazing document. If this was the only surviving artifact of the 20th century, of human civilization tout cour, then future races and alien species will undoubtedly be in agreement (however naively) that we were giants, that we, as a people, humans, earthlings, had emotional depth, a refined aesthetic sense, humour, intellectual refinement, and anything else you would want and hope for in sentient beings. The music here is perfect, sublime, peerless in its execution, epic in its scope, minute and detailed like the most finely wrought baroque trifle. Everything that it is to live and die in this world finds expression and reflection here. Unbelievable. Unforgettable. Unsurpassed. (100stars!!!!!!!!!)I don't know where I find some of the words contained here, anyway ..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I Got tons of stuff on Bird,Mingus,a few on Powell&amp;Roach&amp;a few on Dizzy.but having all of that Genius on Set makes up big time.The Music&amp;Arrangements are Incredible.Bird changed the Game Forever.He is  One Of Jazz's Greatest Pioneers.DIzzy blows The Mind with His Tone.Miles  Davis always gave him Mad Props.Roach is one of the Greatest Drummers ever  in any Style of Music.Powell Rings up Keys&amp;has been featured on Many  Important Recordings.Mingus who I got turned onto a Couple Years back is  Amazing.Simply put.His Tones&amp;Drives are Gold too the Ears.Very  Essential."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This recording is an essential addition to any serious Jazz collection, capturing as it does five Jazz giants recorded together for the one and only time.Charlie Parker is on Alto Sax, Dizzy Gillespie Trumpet, Bud Powell Piano, Charles Mingus bass and Max Roach on drums. From the first number \"Perdido\" you know this something special. A medium tempo version which never stops swinging. Gillespie in particular is in fiery form on this number. On \"Salt Peanuts\" Bud Powell plays a memorable solo, which precedes a thunderous drum solo from Max Roach.The atmosphere is fantastic with the crowd applauding the musicians solos, and sometimes you can hear the musicians cajoaling each other to better performances. Considering the recordings are over fifty years old the sound is pretty good. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because there is a newer 'complete' version of this recording.Sadly Max Roach the last surviving member of the this quintet has just died."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This session always sounds as if it were about to fall apart at the seams, which is part of its incredible charm. While its underrehearsed quality makes a lot of the Prestige Records \"blowing sessions\" of this period sound almost studied by comparison, the resulting album captures the essential joy of Monk's music with a sponteneity lacking in some of his other studio recordings. Drummer Art Blakey proves a particularly explosive partner, really driving things along with intensity and spirit, and Coleman Hawkins clearly is having a blast, turning the still-developing John Coltrane into the tense schoolboy on this session. It's all utterly endearing, from the tune selection to the cover art, with the extended workout on \"Well You Needn't\" so much fun, it oughtta be illegal. If I were forced to choose the two most essential among Monk's many great recordings, it would be Big Band and Quartet in Concert, and this one."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Is this the best Jazz album of all time?  Maybe.  Monk is joyful, abstract, and totally in control on this June '57 session.  But what really kills me is the quality of the compositions.  Monk was, in my eyes at least, first and foremost a Composer (yes, with a capital &quot;C&quot;) of the highest order -- I put him right up there with Mozart, Ellington, or Lennon/McCartney.  Every tune on this outstanding release is, quite simply, a masterpiece: &quot;Off Minor&quot;, &quot;Well, You Needn't&quot;, &quot;Ruby, My Dear&quot;, &quot;Crepuscule with Nellie&quot;, and &quot;Epistrophy&quot; are all stunning in their complexity and endlessly rewarding, even after dozens (or, in my case, thousands) of playings.  This is Art (yes, with a capital &quot;A&quot;) of a rare and lasting beauty and a must for any collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I'll start by saying that this is not the issue of Straight Ahead that I own. I have this as part of the Eric Dolphy Complete Prestige box-set that I reviewed here however many years ago, which was remastered more recently than this issue. So, my review is just on the performance and the quality of the album, not the sound.I love this album! It will always stand in the shadow of Blues &amp; the Abstract Truth because unlike Abstract, this album isn't packed full of as many of the big names in jazz, but don't let that fool you. This is also a classic album.There are times here where Dolphy swings like a demented circus performer, and Nelson is (as usual), dripping with blues and soul. The tunes are great and the performances milk every last drop of loveliness out of them. This is one of those albums where I tend to think that no jazz collection could be considered complete without it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Lay whatever you have heard before aside.  Put aside all your pre-conceived notions about what &quot;great&quot; Miles actually is.  Try not to think of any &quot;concept&quot; albums, or story-line albums.  This  one will speak for itself.This, by far, is the best, and certainly my  favorite, Miles release ever.  What an incredibly broad thing to say about  such a legend!  I know. And before you either wholly dismiss me, or begin  cussing me, hear me out.Out of all the Miles I own, this is the one I  reach for time, after time, after time.  It is amazing.  It is beautiful,  from start to finish. This is exactly like &quot;Chet&quot; by Chet Baker.  It just doesn't get any better.You will love this, and if you give it  the chance, you will understand what I mean."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "THis Disc is Rich in Sound&amp;Quality.Miles Plays with Such Passion&amp;Energy.His Band is Very Top Notch as well.Strong Chemistry makes for Classic Music.this is in a Long,Long,Long, Line Of Great Albums  From this Genius.Not Only Was He Banging on His Instrument but His Genius  at getting the Right Players is Amazing as well.Nobody Before or Since has  had as Many Great Players Alongside as Miles.Maybe Duke Ellington&amp;James  Brown but Overall You Gotta Give Miles The Edge at Having the Best Talent  Around.He is The MAN!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "right from the opening tones of &quot;if i were a bell,&quot; miles and  company (the classic quintet with john coltrane, red garland, paul  chambers, and philly joe jones) set the tone for a quietly swinging set of  cool jazz. miles continued to explore his own version of cool jazz (much  more bop oriented than west coast jazz), but here the sound is becoming  even more uncategorizable, more distinctly miles' own voice and timbre. he  explores melody and themes finding his own phrasing and expansions, leaving  plenty of room for the song to develop as it will. in sum, he uses silence  as part of the form, like ahmad jamal, for instance, creating tension and  setting fires within the tune. the band is stellar and one can hear  coltrane getting his own voice, as well, laying the foundations for what  was to come in a few years. well worth any price!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The album title is a nod to vibraphonist Milt \"Bags\" Jackson, who appears on the album with Sonny Rollins (s), Thelonious Monk (p), Horace Silver (p), Percy Heath (b) and Kenny Clarke (d). The seven cuts - including two versions each of Bags' Groove and But Not For Me - clock in at 45:53.Miles showcases the incredible songwriting talents of Rollins by recording Airegin, Oleo and Doxy. The two takes of the title cut are groove masters, but Rollins takes the spotlight through his work with pen & paper and the sax.The Prestige-era for Miles has a number of intriguing hard bop sides and this album again demonstrates the fabulous compositions, musicians and studio work that defined a generation."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I just received this remastered classic from Amazon and it is ASTOUNDING ! I can't believe it took me so long to pick this up. Miles sounds as good as I've ever heard him and the rest of the musicians are also at their best particularly Milt Jackson on the title track.  Monk sounds a bit tentative and the story is that Miles asked him to sit out while he took his solo but Monk came through when it was his time to comp behind Jackson's solo and take his own solo. He sounds inventive and unmistakably Monk. Horace Silver and Sonny Rollins both sound wonderful and the tracks where they are featured really swing. The heart of this fine CD is the incredible rhythm section of Percy Heath and Keny Clarke. These guys were rock solid throughout this session and with the remastering Heath's bass lines just jump through the speakers.Do not hesitate to purchase this. You will be glad you did."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Does Wes Montgomery live up to the boastful title?  That's the main question any review should answer.  YES.  Wes' playing is generally similar to his other jazz-era (vs pop-era) songs.  He's jaw-dropping on the faster songs.  Wes is good on the slower songs, though he tends to be too nice.  \"The Incredible Jazz Guitar\" is a better album, but \"Boss Guitar\" should be in every fan's collection.  The trio format works out fine.  There's a good reason Grant Green made so many albums with organ - it's very compatible with guitar.  Mel Rhyne gets to take the first solo in \"Dearly Beloved\" and in general provides solid playing.  Jimmy Cobb is, as usual, fantastic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A top ten all time collection of songs in my heart, some of the most fantastic sax on record, hoppingest tunes and heartfelt recording available.  Simply perfect.  I've given five stars to CDs I know are less than perfect, because I love them, but this is pure.  I don't have to tell you all what you already know about Sonny Rollins and this classic release.  We are all lucky Sonny Rollins has stayed with us so long and shared with us so much.  I'd just like to use this public space to thank Sonny again personally for his kindness in taking the time after a fabulous energy-draining virtuoso performance at Kannai Hall, Yokohama, in May '97, to sign this CD and take photos with me and a friend.  These treasures make me proud.  Thank you Sonny."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This CD is a treat from start to finish. I like the mix of well known and not so well known songs, and I especially like Moritat (\"Mack the Knife\") for its straight forward delivery, true to the original rhythm and swing, and a saxophone solo by Sonny that is unparalleled in recorded jazz history. I've never had any issues with Van Gelder re-mixes, and I can confirm that there are a few blips here and there, but I don't consider them distracting and the music can still be easily enjoyed. Fans of sax jazz simply must buy this recording, and I don't see how any serious fan of jazz can be without it. If you are looking for something to broaden a non-jazz oriented music collection, I think this might be a good candidate for you, simply because the music is so much fun. Let 'er rip!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If there is one Sonny Rollins album that you should own then this is it. \"Saxophone Colossus\" is a real gem and is certainly one of the best jazz albums ever made.Sonny Rollins is a great saxophonist who on this occasion has a rythmn section right up to his level which has not been the case on many other of his albums.I have now had this record for six moths and continue to play it almost every day and enjoy it just as much as the first listening. That is how good it is! It is a shame that modern jazz is rarely up to the level of the legends of the 50'S and 60's."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny Rollins , considered by many to be the quintessential live performer, admittedly felt restricted in a studio. However listening to his masterpiece Saxophone Colossus it is clear that he was on this occasion  able to capture some of the energy of a live performance on vinyl. The record is a tour-du-force of Rollins musical vision and mastery of improvisational inventiveness within a melodic and harmonic form that draws the listener in chorus after chorus.Max Roach's drumming drives every track particularly the classic St Thomas. Roach and Rollins trade 4's on Blue 7 and play off of each other beautifully throughout. Tommy Flanagan's piano playing is subtle and perfectly suited to this group.This is my favorite Rollins recording other than those made with Clifford Brown and Max Roach's group."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of the best ever Jazz albums, recorded by one of the top five tenor players in Jazz history.The other musicians are:Tommy Flanagan - PianoDoug Watkins - BassMax Roach - drumsEven if you're not a Jazz fan you'll know Sonny Rollins 'St Thomas' which opens the album, with its calypso melody its one of the best known Jazz tunes. The performances are uniformly excellent and the sound is incredible since this album was recorded 50 years ago.The track 'Moritat' is in fact 'The theme from the three penny opera', but it sounds remarkably similar to 'Mack the Knife'. Whatever the tune really is, Rollins is never less throughly inventive, as anyone who has seen him live will testify to. This track perhaps contains the highlight of the album, where Sonny Rollins trades 4's with Max Roach.This is one of the classic Jazz albums and should be in everyones collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny Rollins' \"Saxophone Colossus\" is one of those albums that you could listen to 20 times in a row and never tire of because it's just that good. I've owned this recording for a couple of years and I still return to it from time to time. Rollins' warm, round tone makes this album the masterpiece it is, but that's not to discount his group for this session: Tommy Flanagan on piano, Doug Watkins on bass, and Max Roach on drums, who provide excellent support. This is a classic for reason. Want to find out why? Pick this up today. An essential jazz recording."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny Rollins, one of the most influential tenor saxophonists in the history of jazz. His deep tone, influenced by Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster. Sonny Rollins is my favorite tenor saxophonist.Sonny is a very unique musician. Some of his ideas are very experimental, but his overall message, just swing! In this interesting format, tenor sax-bass-drums, Sonny shows his stuff, and plays his heart out.In jazz, tenor sax trios are fairly rare. Here, Ray Brown on bass and Shelly Manne on drums help Sonny out by delivering this swinging session.Obviously, the theme of this album was westerns. The old western standard I'm an Old Cowhand, is done here by Newk and the gang. Rollins' original Wagon Wheels is very catchy.Sonny Rollins had some great albums in his career, and this one should be considered to be among the best."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny was in his absolute prime when he cut Way Out West. No tennor ever had a better tone than &quot;Newk&quot;, and that includes some very exclusive company, (Clotrane, Getz, Shorter, etc.) The painstaking remastering job here brings out the brillance of his majestic sound. To me Sonny's pharsing has always had the same inherent rhythem as the great post-war singers like Sinatra and Tony Bennett. Without a single bad note or overstated pharse, Way Out West is some of the best hard-bop you'll ever hear. Fortunately Sonny is still going strong and at seventy-something he is still producing vital music for us to enjoy."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Although not as strong and flowing as the superb \"Saxophone Colussus\" this record still contains some very good tracks. In particular I liked the swinging songs of \"I'm an Old Cowhand\", \"Wagon Wheels\" amd \"Way Out West\" which showcase some great solos from Sonny Rollins.Bassist Ray Brown and Drummer Shelly Manne make worthy contributions with some excellent solos of their own in the rhythm section but feel a little dissapointed with the absence of piano or guitar. When listening to all the songs it sometimes feels in my opinion as if there is something missing eventhough Sonny's playing is mostly wonderful."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "\"Way Out West\" was a very different sounding recording for its time, as was Rollins' \"Freedom Suite.\" I have given this album several listens and just find the whole thing on a musical level to be quite technically great, but the overall quality of the music is empty, because of the absence of a chordal instrument (i.e. piano, guitar). Perhaps many people don't need to hear the chords, but I always liked chords in music. I feel that they help round out the overall sound. If you like Sonny Rollins, this is still an album worth picking up just to hear what it is, a very different record for Rollins. If you're interested in hearing Rollins playing against chords in a fuller band check out his albums \"Saxophone Colossus\" and \"Tenor Madness.\" You can't go wrong with these."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Some excellent reviews of this album that cover all you need to know about the music ... so all I can do is agree! Truly, as others have noted, this was a daring, revolutionary album when it was released. Innovative production and puutting out songs that took up the whole side of an album? Insane ... and brilliant. This was a true immersion in soul magic, hot buttered, funky, and silky smooth. My only knock against this \"Anniversary\" edition is the fact that the \"Bonus\" tracks are simply two single edits of tracks already on the album. Come on, record company weasels, give us something truly special or rare! If you make us buy an album/CD we already own, at least justify another purchase with something really extra. That gripe aside, this remains a wonderful listening experience."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have been a Mobile Fidelity fan for years.  To be sure their product is always top shelf.  This release is no exception...it beats the socks off of the regular issue in terms of musical presentation.  Still, this recording would shine in 5.1 surround, so come on MoFi, give us a 5.1 presentation.  Sure I know your contract with Sony (CBS) prohibits you from releasing 5.1 CDs of their products, but this is NOT a CBS product.  If you got the original master tapes, getting the original 8 track master would not be much more difficult.  Please try a little harder next time."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "...I love this because it has that ultro long version of &quot;Walk On By&quot; (I used to boast to my 45 singles buying friends that they did not know how much they were being cheated)(Da-da DA-da DA-da Daaah-Duuum!) and the big hit you never get to hear anywhere--not even on classic soul radio--&quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;...where you can imagine that dude going back to the hills of Tennessee after Iko's fabulous set up. The Barkays and the precursors to the Movement? Awesome. Get it and blow your mind."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was the first album of the Staple Singers that I purchased on CD. I mainly got it to find out how their hit Respect Yourself sounds as well as I'll Take You There. I'm sure pleased that I did get this CD. Respect Yourself is almost five minutes long (while the single of it was only three and a half); this song is one of my favorite of theirs, as it tells you that if you disrespect anybody that you run into, you are disrespecting yourself as well. That is a great song. I also love I'll Take You There. The single of it is about three and a half minutes long, but on this album, you get the song in extended form. Love this song too!! I also like: This World, Are You Sure, We the People, I'm Just Another Soldier, and Name the Missing Word. Love this group. I have every one of their Stax album titles on CD. These folks are full of soul!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Like most 1970s Isaac Hayes albums, To Be Continued mines the revolutionary direction the Black Moses laid withHot Buttered Soulin 1969--taking pop songs and making them into huge, funk-orchestral odes.On Hot Buttered, this was unprecidented. To Be Continued is almost as good. But the hard funk edges here are beviled down, in favor of lush balladry essays. This is certianly a viable direction, and it is amazing to hear Hayes carve out huge caverns of sound from consice AM pop tunes.If the funky spikes had been maintained, at least for a number or two, this may have made for a better album, but for technique and the massive arranging talent that was Isaac Hayes, its hard to argue against this album"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "But it's not. Any way you slice it though it's still good. The weak spot here was the cover of \"Our Day Will Come\". However, it made up for it rather nicely with the cover of \"The Look Of Love\" which has reminiscence of the Philly Soul sound from the 70's. His was an even better version than Vanilla Fudge's. He also did a top notch cover of \"You Lost That Loving Feeling\". I write this not because we happen to share the same last name, but because it's some good sounding soul music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Back in 2005, one of my favorite artists by the name of Jaguar Wright re-made the song \"Woman To Woman\" on her album, Divorcing Neo 2 Marry Soul. I instantly fell in love with the song and I just had to hear the original. So I bought this the other day.Before listening to the album straight through, I had to cheat and listen to her version. No disrespect to Ms. Wright, but... there's just no comparison! Shirley is an amazing soul singer and she delivers the lyrics with true skill, expression and class. Why is she not more well-known?! Going through the rest of the album, I loved it just as much as the title track. I especially enjoyed \"It Ain't No Fun.\" When Shirley speaks in her songs, it really feels genuine, unscripted and exclusive. This is a great 70's soul album and I highly recommend it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "\"Black Moses\" is Isaac Hayes' finest and most accomplished album ever. His stunning remakes of \"Never Can Say Goodbye\", \"Part Time Love\", \"They Long To Be Close To You\", \"Your Love Is So Doggone Good\" and \"For The Good Times\" have him literally reinventing these hits and making them all his own in the process. Lush and ultra-smooth string arrangements and orchestration are ever-present on most tracks that add a haunting quality which matches Isaac's deep baritone and romantic (yet at times wistful) vocals perfectly. This album remains a stone classic of '70s Soul while serving as a precursor to what the late Barry White would do shortly thereafter."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you have heard of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Johnson, Walter Trout, Johnny Lang or Joe Kubek; Ask where does their music come from? Most probably the answer is: Freddie King; Burglar.In this album, Freddie sets the standards of any guitar used in a blues or a rock song.A 1972 release, shortly before his death, this album will blow your mind and ears away. No other blues album of its generation comes close; and this is nothing like Fredddie's previous releases.I believe that Freddie King ranks in Blues the same as Miles Davis in Jazz. Too bad he died too soon.Highly recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "One of the first pop two-disc box sets is now on one CD. The title refers to Donovan as the \"prince of flower power\", the \"Garden\" being his fans. A must for both young and old. Donovan wrote the liner notes (the first half of the disc's lyrics are very small, being copied from the LP sleeve. The \"Songs For Little Ones\" half begins with the wailing of Donovan's son (probably Donovan Leitch Jr. who was born around the time). Like many of his tunes they are simple and childlike. He even pays tribute to his mentor Derroll Adams in the last song \"Epistle to Derroll\".It should be noticed there are many references to sea and aquatic life (a recurring Donovan theme) so this is the perfect album for a summer's day!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Depending on how one views the landscape, this could be seen as the second solo effort by Ian Anderson, since the Jethro Tull album \"A\" was slated to be Anderson's debut, but was released under the band's name due to a decision by record company executives.Released in November 1983, it is a collaborative effort with keyboardist Peter-John Vettese that strides back into the progressive rock/electronics of \"A.\" The 10 tracks are equally split between Anderson and Anderson/Vettese compositions, while clocking in at 38:29.The standout selections are Made in England, User-Friendly and Different Germany. The electronic period of Anderson (solo/band) is oftentimes overlooked by fans and critics, but it shows an artist attempting to use a variety of paints on a familiar canvas to keep the sound fresh, which is a creative walk down a lane of brilliant light."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Obviously, from all the other reviews posted here, there is quite the chasm between the love-or-hate-it listeners.  I am here to comment only on the audio.The original, now out-of-print 1990 Chrysalis-label CD was just an LP-EQ'd master transfered to CD.  The 1997, also now unfortunately OOP UK BGO-label version, was properly remastered for CD, and is head-and-shoulders the superior version of the two.So, if you are going to buy this somewhat controversial album, at least get the version that sounds the best... The BGO."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I found this title on a list of 'best psychadelic rock albums' and had surprisingly never heard of it. I've always been a huge fan of Jefferson Airplane and Pink Floyd, but have never really expanded my psychadelic horizons to the lesser known bands. The album is great all the way through with an excellent variety of lyrics, instrumentation, and melodies that maintain your interst. Its feel is much the same as 'after bathing at baxers' from the airplane. If you like that album, you will definitely like this one. Any fan of the classic psychadelic bands will find this album a nice addition to his/her collection. Only thing that I didn't like about it was the bonus tracks that included many of the same tracks as the album proper and didn't really contribute anything new. Overall, any fan of psychadellic rock should have this."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Originally released in 1968, as this was the Los Angeles short-lived psych band's only record, unfortunately. Wound up liking this CD reissue much better than I had expected. With this Sundazed reissue, you get the lp's initial ten songs + ten more bonus cuts tagged on for good measure. Thoroughly enjoyed a couple of their awesome [undiscovered psychedelic gems] \"Cloud Song\" followed by \"The Garden Of Earthy Delights\", the quirky \"I Won't Leave My Wooden Wife For You, Sugar\", the harmony vocals enriched \"Where Is Yesterday\", the adventurous six-minute ahead-of-it's time \"Stranded In Time\" and \"Metaphor For An Older Man\". Turns out the extra tunes you get on this disc isn't bad either. Recommended for fans of Druids Of Stonehenge, Fifty Foot Hose and early Jefferson Airplane."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "What Kind Of Man Would I Be is A Great Song.Sadly the SLow-Jams have Overtaken Mint So it's Hard TO Really Appreciate their Overall Ability to Play Many Different Styles.Rick James,Earth,Wind&fire,Gap band,Lakeside,Ohio Players&ew Jack Swing among other styles among others you can Hear on them.Minneapolis is in THE HOUSE On Ain't Hookin'Me  Up Enough which Sounds Alot Like PRINCE'S If I WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.Funky  Weekend would fit Perfectly on A New Time Album.The SLow Cuts SHow More  Originality than The Up-Tempo Stuff.Still You Gotta Give them Props For  Being A Real BAND In These Watered-Down Days Of R-N-B.I Prefer the 2nd Disc  Overall as their Best."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The one thing about this CD is how Babyface and Toni Braxton have the same style.What a perfect match.When I first heard &quot;Another Sad Love Song,&quot; I was blown away from this new singer.The deep soulfull voice was beutifull.&quot;Best Friends,&quot; written my Toni is one of my favorites from the album,but the one that really gets my heart pumping is &quot;Seven Whole Days.&quot;In some ways,I can see alot of Anita Baker's vocals in Toni on this cut,and thats a compliment.I really enjoyed this debut record from Toni.One of the great talented singers to come from the 90's."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton is super sexy and with an equally seductive voice. Her debut was a perfect introduction to the R&B; world. While I think Secrets is her best work Toni Braxton is also impressive.Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again are super hits. Enough said. Love Affair, Seven Whole Days, Love Shoulda Brought you Home and my fav You Mean the World to Me are all highlights.The reason I rated this 4 stars is the other songs are okay I guess but I usually skip. The Cd can get moody and depressing without a true uptempo song.If your looking for Classic Toni look at Secrets!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "What a good album. \"Another Sad Love Song\" is upbeat while \"Breathe Again\" is sensuous and cherubic. \"Seven Whole Days\" is for people who miss their special partner. There are 5 singles from Toni Braxton's debut! \"Love Affair\" has a nice beat. \"Candlelight\" is breathtaking. \"Spending My Time With You\" is energetic. \"Love Shoulda Brought You Home\" has great piano. \"I Belong To You\" sounds merry. \"How Many Ways\" brings up the idea of different love techniques. \"You Mean The World To Me\" is fantastic but serious. \"Best Friend\" is a slow jam with piano. Enough said."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton's self-titled debut CD was undoubtedly the best album ever released by LaFace Records.  Unlike most of her contemporaries, Toni Braxton is a truly soulful singer whose emotive and soul-stirring vocals breathe life and give meaning to even the most mundane material. Sultry, sensuous, romantic and classy ballads like \"Breathe Again\", \"Best Friend\", \"You Mean The World To Me\", \"Candlelight\" and \"Love Srought You Home\" were all major hits that deservedly propelled this CD to multi-platinum status and made Ms. Braxton an international superstar. L.A. Reid, Babyface and the other producers and songwriters who worked on this album gave Toni Braxton some truly first-rate songs but her stunning and ultra-elegant vocals are your real reason for buying this CD."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "[One CD, with a running time of 53:18] Fifty-three minutes of pure paradise! These twelve songs show off Toni Braxton's silky smooth voice at its best. R&B; or pop, whatever you want to call these songs, all are smooth, quiet, and easy to listen to love songs that make for some excellent slow dancing. My favorites are Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again. But, all of the songs on this CD are excellent!As an added bonus, the CD's paperwork contains the words to the songs, plus the back is a nice, small poster. I love extras!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember the duet between Babyface and Miss Braxton, and how impressed I was by her vocal abilities..Then she came out with this album!! Oh my god, the woman tore up each and every song!! With Babyface's lyrics and production and her voice, this was one those perfect producer-artist teams that could do no wrong..I still love this album to this day..Most of the songs on this album are R&B classics anyway..You know an album is great when no matter how dated it sounds, its still listenable..If your a fan of women who have powerful voices, pick up this cd..You cannot go wrong!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "TONI BRAXTON was a smashing debut CD back in the 90s, and still is. Braxton's unique voice combined with original, impossible to label songs like the sexy standout \"Breathe Again\" show what magic first-rate producers like L.A. Reid and Babyface can do with an extraordinary singer. Braxton caresses her lyrics with jazzy, Anita Baker-ish embellishments, slurred phrasing, breathy come-ons, and leaping octaves. She swings, sways, wails and wallops her way through this outstanding showcase. Beautifully sung and still sounds fresh as when it was first released."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This CD is so tight it's difficult to describe.  Every singlesong is straight.  From the first one, to D.E.E.P. they are all easyto listen to.  I judge a CD by how many tracks it has that I love to listen to each time they come on.The subject matter involves most classic rap themes, but embraces knowledge, and acknowledges the destabilizing effect that hip hop culture can have on those not prepared for it.This CD has 8 or 9 classics on it.  I mean every time the song comes on, you just bob your head and zone out.  Dre's lyrics are unstoppable, Big Boi's lyrics are unstoppable, plus on the one skit, they let you know just what it's like to be an Outkast.&quot;an outkast is someone who isn't accepted in society because of his hair, his beliefs or his skin color, now ask yourself, are you an outkast.  If you believe the fundamental truths contained in this album you probably are."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Outkast's first album is one of those albums that you buy and keep it in constant rotation. The production was great and their flow was on point plus the guest appearances were a nice touch. Standout Tracks: MYINTROTOLETUKNOW, AINT NO THANG, SOUTHERNPLAYALISTICADILLACMUSIK, CALL OF THE WILD, PLAYERS BALL(original and reprise are cool with me), CLAIMIN TRUE, GIT UP GIT OUT, CRUMBLIN HERB,HOOTIE HOO and DEEP. Filler: Funky Ride is kind of boring but thats it. Bottom Line: Southernplayalisticadillacmusik is a highlight album of 94 easily. Songs like Aint No Thang, Player's Ball, Git Up Git Out and the title track are all songs that make this album a requirement for any rap fan's collection. Also recommended by Outkast: Atliens."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Positives: For the most part, this album is straight up Southern funk and good rapping. This is before Outkast got really good but it's still a solid collection of songs. The production is pretty good and you can see the beginning of a strong lyrical duo forming. My favorite track is &quot;Git Up, Git Out&quot; cause I can identify with it.Negatives: Becuase I heard their best album to date, Aquemini, before this one, I expected more in terms of production and lyrics. If I would have heard this album before I heard their more recent stuff, I would have said this album was pretty dope. Overall, this is good Southern rap."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Highlights are You're Making Me High, Talking In His Sleep, Find Me A Man, Let It Flow, Why Should I Care, Come On Over Here and I Love Me Some Him.Filler? Not a lot, but Un-break My Heart comes close and In The Late Of Night/Toni's Secrets is OK and nothing to speak of. So I guess that means no filler! ^_^;;Cover Art: A-Songwriting: B+Vocals: B-Vocal Emotion: A-Production: B+Overall: 4.3754.375 = 4.384.38 stars."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Secrets by Toni Braxton is her most beloved and best-selling album of her career. This album is pretty good but it's also a mixed bag as well. After a thousand listens to, Un-Break my Heart is just plain nauseating! You're Making Me High is probably her strongest single ever, love those naughty lyrics and pulsating beat. How Could An Angel Break My Heart is a beautiful ballad which was co-written by Braxton. The rest of the songs are pretty ordinary and jeez most of the time I can't understand what she is singing, she needs to enuicate her words. This album is a great flashback to the mid-90s but that's pretty much it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton's best work! When I first purchased the CD I thought the CD wasn't all that good. it had to grow on me on boy did it! Every song is great. Period!Toni's hits are Unbreak my Heart, How could an angel break my heart, and Make Me High. But the other songs are outstanding as well.There's no me without you is Toni hitting the low notes perfectly. Let it flow is a perfect I-need-to-leave-my-man for the intelligent woman.There are enough midtempo and slow jams to make this a perfect R&B; record.My favs are Let it flow, Love me some him, Unbreak my heart, I don't want to, and There's no me."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember this album when I was 9. I love this album. She delivered a record that showcases her maturity while offering a diversity of music sure to appeal to her ever-growing audience of young and old alike. She covered the spectrum while still maintaining her own soulful identity. She had craft an album that has a distinctly personal feel to it.  This album is a glowing testament to her status as one of the decade's most vibrant,exciting,soul deep,straight from the heart young artists. This album allows us listeners the opportunity to witness Toni in an array of musical moods and settings. This album has been certified 8x Platinum. Remember,this was 1996-1997."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you can...tell anyone you know about this CD!Toni has outdone herself: most of the tracks produced by Babyface (including the Summer 1996 # 1 hit YOU'RE MAKING ME HIGH), but with support from David Foster (UN-BREAK MY HEART, written by Diane Warren and one of the best selling singles ever...), R. Kelly (I DON'T WANT TO), Soulshock &amp; Carlin (I LOVE ME SOME HIM, extra nice tune to me...) and Toni Rich Project (COME ON OVER HERE).Add some studio help from Keny G. and a soundtrack tune (LET IT FLOW, from WAITING TO EXHALE), and the 3 bonus remixes of all of the singles off the CD - including the dancefloor anthem for UN-BREAK MY HEART...You will come up with one of the best R'n'B albums ever"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This a a brilliant album from Toni. Beautiful ballads throughout and her voice is so soothing and sultry. My particular favourites are &quot;Un-break my heart&quot; and &quot;How could an Angel break my heart&quot;, but all songs are good. This is an album I can listen to over and over again...beautiful. The 24 page booklet contains all lyrics and plenty of photos of Toni. If you're looking for an album for a romantic dinner or 'something', then look no further. Track #12 though, I think is a trick...it doesn't exist."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This CD packed a powerful punch when it hit the streets and airwaves.  Toni was at the the top of the game before the industry pushed mannequins and Barbie dolls into the spotlight and shoved their non-singing selves down America's throat..(forgive me..small rant). Anyway, Toni puts down this set in a real way..she sings from her soul and does a great job on each song.  Yes, I still play this CD.  It's a much more mature set than her first CD and better produced than her subsequent releases.  Hope one day she gets back in the studio and gives her some quality adult music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton took off like a spaceship in the 1990's. Secrets, her second album, remains as one of the most romantic and simple albums I've ever heard from her. Romantic Ballads like Un-Break My Heart, and In The Late Of Night, showcase her talent in R&amp;B as a strong siren. While dance tracks Come On Over Here and You're Makin Me High, inject an grittier sound in her voice. This is the one album I enjoyed the most that Toni Braxton released. It was really worth the bucks."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The 5 stars isnt for her beauty, for her musical talent. I have listened to this album countless times. Without a doubt a classic. Im not too big on much R & B I am more into underground hiphop but I have to admit this is music that will be felt from all musical background based audiences. I heard somewhere this album is like 10+ platinum.. and that isnt too hard to believe. Her 2 most international hits \"Makin me High\" and \"Unbreak My Heart\" on on this album. So make sure you get this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton waited 3 years to release her sophomore effort, Secrets, which follows the same formula as its predecessor while managing to sound fresh and new. The big ballad \"Un-break My Heart\" is the obvious smash hit, but other classics include the sultry \"You're Makin' Me High\" and the relaxing \"Let it Flow.\" Smooth album cuts like \"Why Should I Care\" and \"Come on Over Here\" ensure that the album moves with a soulful, slow-burn feel from beginning to end. Secrets is the rare sophomore album that outdoes the artist's debut. 4 Stars."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "This a much better improvement than her debut which was good but not great like this one. The cd starts of coming alive and then soars with tracks like Talking in his sleep, Find me a man, Why should I care and I love me some him. After 8 years on the market this cd still has a refined sound to it as if debut yesturday . If you don't or never owned a Toni B album this is a very good one to start with. Also Try THE HEAT &amp; More up to date More Than A Woman."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "From the cool way she sings the word 'find' on the opener &quot;Come On Over Here&quot; to the percussive, bass-heavy track produced by Tony Rich, &quot;Secrets&quot; is an extraordinary piece of ordinary music. While there is nothing especially innovative about it, Toni's second LP is a pleasure from start to finish (save for the horrendous &quot;How Could An Angel Break My Heart&quot; bleccchh!!)and it features one of my favorite Braxton tunes, the half sung/half spoken &quot;Talking In His Sleep&quot; a seductive, percolating jam that features some of her best vocals ever and a brilliantly minimalist track with live drums, keyboards and some wicked wah-wah guitar on the final chorus. &quot;Secrets&quot; is Toni Braxton's finest hour and a testament to the quality pouring out of LaFace Records in the mid 90's."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I can't believe Outkast only now is getting recognized because of Speakkerbox/The Love Below. I mean recognized by winning awards, producing other peoples songs, and even becoming movie stars. But this is their true masterpiece in my eyes. Nothing really poppy, straight hard core rap. Favorites are as follow: Two Dope Boyz (In A Cadillac), ATLiens, Wheelz Of Steel, Jazzy Belle, Elevators (Me & You),  Babylon, Mainstream, and E.T. (Extraterrestrial). True Hip Hop Classic. Get this and their other albums before SB/TLB."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "the fact that that amazon lists the following other artists as ones you may be interested in if you pick up this album: Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Ludacris and Britney Spears. Where has Outkast gone wrong in recent years?It's simple, if you enjoy Superbowl halftime shows and TiVo MTV for your favorite TV shows, please DON'T buy this album. ATLiens is nothing like the new stuff. This album is raw. It's scuffed. It's a 93 degree Atlanta summer Friday afternoon and there's nothing going on but bad traffic and this album.Pick it up if you liked the first (SouthernPlayalistik...) but don't bother if Speakerboxx/LB is what you are looking for."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Along with Aquemini, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. At first this album may seem a little bit out there. When you look at the the cover, they look like some \"aliens or genies. But once you start listening you realize how good songs like \"Wheelz of Steel\" and \"Mainstream\" are. Then the rest of the album just falls into place. People who don't own the album may have heard the radio songs \"ATLiens\" and \"Elevators\". If you think those are good but haven't heard the rest of the album, then you're in for a treat. The rest of the album is just as good and better in many cases. This album is also really good for people who like to blaze it up and listen to some music that will really f#%k with you. Overall it is an excellent album for anybody and if you haven't heard it, I would recommend getting it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is Outkast at its finest moment.  This album came out in 96, however, it was so ahead of its time that if you listened to it today, you would not even notice that it is 7 years old.  The beats are futuristic even for todays standards, and the lyrics are extremly thought provoking and hard hitting just like Camacho and Vargas.  I must admit that I am not a fan of Southern hip hop, however, with Outkast and the Goodie Mob I must make an exception.  I believe this album is underrated and should not be missed by anyone.  It is almost a shame that I found this in a 10 dollar bargain bin at Virgin Records."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "the title of this review may confuse you but i can honestly say this is the weakest outkast album. that dont mean nuthin tho, cos its still a 5 star classic, its just that their other albums are better musically and lyrically. this aint slouchin though. if you got all the other outkast albums and not this, you definetly need to get it. if you want the best kast joint then get aquemini first, then southernplayalisticadillacmuzik then get the rest. this was kasts transitional period between old skool southern sh*t and eclectic crazy musical, lyrical perfection. its dope but kast had funk on their debut, funky musical progression on their third and an extension of that on stankonia. speakerboxxx and love below is dope too but it also proves that both emcees are better togetherp.s.outkast is my favorite artists and aquemini is my favorite album of all time"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In the last few years Outkast may have alienated the bulk of their original audience but there's still no denying how truly magnificent this album is. Amongst my many many records there are a select few that need to be replaced every couple of years because they are so over-played that they become physically unlistenable. This is one of them. Big Boi and Dre establish themselves as Atl's finest MCs, the production is mellow gold and the overall vibe is just outstanding. Tracks like 'Two Dope Boys', 'ATLiens' and 'Wheelz of Steel' are among my favorite rap songs of all time. Air-tight flows and beats that make your head bob and your speakers purrr with bowel-obstructing basslines; this album is right up there with fellow mid-90s classics like Reasonable Doubt, Stakes is High, Beats Rhymes and Life and Labincalifornia. Don't sleep on this.... and when you're done congratulating yourself for (re)discovering this masterpiece jump forward a couple years and cop their almost-as-classic album Aquemini."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "they expose a nerve with this one!most rappers shout-out god in they credits, but few touch on somethin spiritual in their actual lyrics...outkast aint nowhere near saints, but you can feel the spiritual searchin in the undertones of what they are sayin...soul searchin is what hip-hop needs more of.  that's what sets this release from other hip-hop classics; these boys are always lookin to grow beyond not just where they at, but from where they might be tomorrow....but yall proly aint feelin me on that, so i'll just say this:&quot;me anyuuu  yomama an yocuz zin toooooooooo......&quot;"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "ATLiens, in my opinion, is a better CD thanSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzik.  Both are definite hip hop classics, but I have this draw to ATLiens.  I can't explain what it is.The CD is very different from the first.  Where the first was built around the gangster concept, this CD builds its own concept.  One I have yet to put a name to.My favorite songs include Two Dope Boys, ATLiens, Jazzy Belle, Elevators, Babylon, Millenium, and Extra-Terrestrial.Definite Must Have."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is a good album. The production is pretty good, the guest appearances go well with Pac( Method Man, Redman, Big Syke, Outlaws, Daz, Kurupt) and Pac maintains a decent flow. However his subject matter on this album strays from a more focused and serious Pac to the full fledged thug. The subject matter of All Eyez on Me does not equal up to the level of his previous efforts such as Me Against the World, and 2Pacalypse Now. Once again, a pretty good album for beats and to bump in the car, but Pac left the focused, thought provoking lyrics in exchange for the thug."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No doubt that this is the best Gangsta Rap-album ever. And no doubt that this is one of the best (maybe thee best) hiphop-albums of all time.If you are a fan of 50 CENT, Ja RULE, C-Murder, LIL ZANE etc and u do NOT own this you need to buy it QUICK becouse if it wasn't for this album none of them would sound like they do, IN FACT at many times they are stealing Tupac's art and that's a shame.People seem to think that CALIFORNIA LOVE is Tupac's best song but that's far from it, In fact I could mention 100 songs from TUPAC that is better. (but I won't)The best songs are: &quot;WHEN WE RIDE&quot;,&quot;SHORTY WANNA B A THUG&quot;, &quot;CAN'T C ME&quot;, &quot;ALL EYEZ ON ME&quot; hey, it's not many songs on the album who aren't great so BUY IT.Rate it: 5/5"}
