She actually made some jokes that raised my eyebrows since she is now a lesbian. I didn't like this because it seemed hypocritical but I think Wanda Sykes is really funny. She is one of the few comedians who can make me really LOL (Laugh Out Loud). If you want to see what her comedy was like before she came out a lesbian or you are a Wanda Sykes fan, watch it. I am a huge fan of hers. I would like to see her in a live how. I am glad she is true to herself now and came out as a lesbian. I hope Wanda keeps on making me and others laugh for a long time to come."}

I had heard of the series previously but was only convinced of buying it after seeing an intervewi with the actress. What a suprise: this is a somewhat lesscorrect version of Friends meets My Name Is Earl. I agree that this may not be correct at all since this series has no respect for conventional moarl issues such as lying about having cancer, discovering a friend's grandfather was a nazi. It also tackles the strange love men sometimes has for guns ets... In some ways it is difficult to describe and understand if you have not seen this gem of comedy."}

It often hi-lightes the old and the ugly and in doing so cultivates a good portion of the laughs.Worth you time and money....bg"}

Watching the whole seasons through, it is obvious that while Adam and Jamie were younger in this season they were also a lot angrier at each other. Perhaps they learned each others quirks as the seasons progressed but it is interesting to go back to the early days.

Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Massachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film.

This is definitive 70's Noir and a title fully worthy of a pull-out-all-the-stops release that Criterion consistently provides.

The acting is superb with the stolid Robert Mitchum leading the cast.  I particularly liked Steven Keats' gundealer and Richard Jordan's duplicitous fed.

Luckily we don't have to see that.  What we do see is what would happen after a  nuclear exchange.

Henry VIII went down in history due the creativity of his marriages and his religious beliefs.  His daughter from Anne Boleyn turned out to be Britain's greatest monarch so something came out of it.

No one is actually who they appear to be, right down to the minor players and even those who appear less than briefly. It's brilliant, really. They have hidden agendas, hidden relationships and hidden skeletons. The other gimmick is the constant time shifting: scenes play out \"Three Months Later\" etc etc constantly throughout, but you only get a tease of what's really going on. The writing here is top-notch, and old Glenn Close really outdoes herself as the Machiavellian lawyer who bends every ethics rule that ever existed on her way to trying to win damages cases.

She focuses her work on a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher (amazingly played by Danson) for insider trading. The first scene of the first episode shows Ellen running half naked in a raicoat covered in blood in the streets of New York. In each episode we discover a new piece of the puzzle and the events that led to that first scene.

The key line that sums up the entire season is spoken by Close's character Patty Hewes, &#34;Trust no one.&#34;  Not exactly a great message to instill in people, but it works well in a TV drama about lawyers.  Other than Ellen and her boyfriend David there really aren't many characters in this show worth admiring.  Everyone is lying to everyone, which makes it difficult at times to figure out what is really going on, but as the old saying goes, &#34;The truth has a way of rising to the surface,&#34; and all lies are revealed.

Its a damn funny show, but more than that, it includes a little bit of everything, from suprisingly solid action to a dab of romance.My main worry is how long they can sustain the show's formula, from Chuck's memory flashes/missions to the tension between he and Yvonne Strahovski.  But I will be there for the whole ride."}

I do watch some of the shows available online offered by the different networks on their sites. Amazon happened to offer the first episode of Life free.  Free is a good thing and also a great way to gain viewers like myself.  I am hooked.  \"Life\" is not your run of the mill cop show.  Charlie is not your run of the mill cop.  I own season 1 on DVD and have already pre-ordered season 2(have to love Amazon's price guarantee)and season 2 is a must see and in my case must own.  If you haven't seen Life you haven't lived."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Quirky, clever, and very satisfying, Life is an excellent police procedural that takes place in Los Angeles. LAPD detective partners Crews and Reese are perfect foils, seeming opposites that play off each other's best and worst personality traits in such a way that the viewer ends up liking both characters, a difficult feat. Actors Lewis and Shahi do an excellent job. Lewis' American accent is spot on, and Shahi (a very beautiful woman) does the tough-cop, no-nonsense, recovering addict role just right. Other characters/actors are also great. Although I wanted the series to go on and on (it was cancelled), please don't be hesitant to watch the 2 seasons that are available. The underlying mystery, developed a little at a time through each episode, is satisfyingly (if perhaps not completely) resolved at the end. I watched the last episode last night, and I'm a little sad now. I will miss Crews and Reese."}

His character (who gets out of prison for a murder he didn't do after 12 years,)is a cop who is quirky and spouts zen phiolosophy to his gorgeous partner all day. Either you like the main characters 'quirky' personality and will get into the show; or you won't which is what I experienced.In addition the flash back storytelling style grew tiresome quickly; Robin Weigert as his Captain and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome's Wife (Jennifer Siebold)both good actors, play very unlikable characters. In fact only Adam Arkin as Damien's ex-con financial advisor, is 'normal' and enjoyable to watch here. A big disappointment as a summer replacement show; get \"Burn Notice\" instead--it's great!l"}

The male lead is recognizable from the hit cable series &#34;Homeland.&#34;  Yes, it's another cop detective drama and there's always a murder to solve.  But there are enough other quirky plot twists and the murders also have twists.  You find out right away that the male lead detective was himself framed and spent 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.  So these various parallel plots and plot twists keep it very interesting. The acting is good and there is also an element of humor.  So all in all, it is a very entertaining series that makes you want to keep watching it."}

I really like the format of it - the way the characters' actions and dialogue are set up.  Adding Alan Arkin to the cast was an excellent choice.  He's such a good actor as is the main character Charlie, played by Damian Lewis, who plays this insightful man who is so grateful for the simple things in life having been in prison for many years for a crime he did not commit.

The interesting hook was that he not only took the references huge settlement but had negotiated to keep his old job as a detective in the same place that accused, arrested, prosecuted and jailed him.  Hmmmmm, different. The humor is a sideline to a jaundiced look at the new/former workplace and although I think the female partner's role is a bit over the top, the cases are interesting and the tracking of who actually committed the crime he went to prison for is well thought out and executed. Thank you.&#8203;"}
{"label": 0, "raw": "The twist here is that detective Charlie Crews was put in jail for 12 years for a crime that he did not commit.  Imagine going through all  of that and then going back into the police force.  His wife has remarried, and some people still will not admit that he is innocent.  Add to this a partner who does not want to be with him, and you've got a man with some issues.  But he tries to handle them with Zen philosophy.  He also has a constant hankering for fresh fruit, since he never got any in prison.Damian Lewis is sympathetic and likeable as Crews, while Adam Arkin is in solid form as his roommate and former inmate-pal.  He helps to handle Crews' enormous settlement.A nice show with interesting characters. Fans of Deadwood will enjoy Robin Weigert in the role of the commander of the police officers."}

Where as the original was just silly, this seems (so far) as a well thought out story, with people that we may come to care about for (good or ill).The subplots, of Jamie's reletionships with her sister, and evil crazy counterpart, for me (at least so far) make for good drama.They've got my interest, I just hope the show lives up to the pilot."}

Overall it suffers from a slightly dull athmosphere, and it is true that the writing could have been tighter but the acting is rather good and the effects are first-rate even if they are somewhat in the background. So the story is quite simple, underachieving bartender Jamie Summers is almost killed during an accident and re-built by her experimental-surgeon boyfriend. Afterwards it is quite straightforward. But as I wrote it is not as bad as some other reviewers put it."}

I thought brainiacs were sexy - NO -  they are just guys who's brains have outgrown their heads.  The funniest part in this show is the overt discomfort that is evident in these guys when they find themselves in everyday situations surrounded by dumb folk like you and me.  My favorite episode was when Sheldon got the flu and became the center of the universe (unto himself) and the great effort his friends went to in order to avoid him during his illness.

The DVDs look and sound excellent, and the extras are a step up from the previous release, though they are missing a few of the more popular elements from previous sets.

Enjoy the show, it is pretty decent...This season was a bit weird not having the old staffers with House but they did some rather odd things and came out ok.

You got Scofield dumped in the most horrific prison known to man.  You got Bellick walking around half-naked lookin' like something the cat dragged in, after it threw it up.  Mahone is going through some serious withdrawal issues.  And Linc on the outside pretty much clueless.  My boy Sucre is still hangin' around dedicated to Michael for all he's done.  T-Bag continues his menacing wrath. Newcomers, Whistler and Lechero and the vicious Gretchen a.k.a Susan B. make for some very interesting storylines.  I agree that that daggone writer's strike did make this season seems rushed.  It's all worth it though to see Wentworth Miller all hot and sweaty between a rock and a hard place."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I enjoyed this third season more than the previous seasons. I found the acting and storyline much superior than previously. I like all the twists throughout the episodes, keeping one at the edge of his seat. Outguessing the plot can be difficult.  This season is also action packed, with every episode offering non-stop action. The way all the characters come together is also fascinating and remarkable, and their motives are unknown. Even the temporary break between Michael and Lincoln over the death of ****** (removed as not to spoil the story) was unexpected.The inmates inside Sona, the Panamanian prison from where Michael Scofield must escape, were very believable.  His escape attempts were well conceived and believable as well. The Panamanian landscape offered an exotic touch to the storyline, different from the maximum-security prison at Fox River.I really recommend this season, and can't wait for season four."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "It's truely unfortunate how quickly this show took a nose-dive after such an excellent first season. This is easily the worst season of Heroes, but to fair this is due to the writer's strike and their best writer from the first season leaving; he returns for the forth season but it's too late to save the show. Having said all that there's still some great progression with the main characters and a fair amount of interesting new characters that works well within season 2. If you're only a casual fan of the show I'd recommend skipping this one, as it doesn't really tie much into the rest of the series aside from a few details, and only purchase the first season, but if you're a pretty big fan then get all of them since there's only four seasons."}

My only observation is that the some of characters acted completely... well out of character, and a lot of plot devices were used to move the weaker plot lines along. If Season 1 wasn't as good as it was, this Season would not have been so disapointing.Still all of that said, you need to watch Season 2 to get to Season 3, so recommended for the Heroes fan."}

Kristen bell is in this season, and the guy from the past (Japan 1871) appears to be a great addition.  I love to watch some of the old characters learning more about their past / families, and some characters are not sure what side they are on any more.  Who is the good team, and who is the bad team.

The first season gave us the introduction of the hero characters and their individual stories and plots for why they did what they did,  the second and the rest of the season gave us more on the superhero plotline stories rather then the secret identity story plot it felt like.  While there are a few characters who felt they weren't needed it didn't detract from the enjoyment I got from watching the show, and for the price the set is going for right now I feel it's forgivable especially since this is the shortest season of the four seasons the show as on the air.  The video and audio are great with nice clarity and sound especially as you hear the background sound.  So again while this wasn't the greatest season it's still and enjoyable enough season to add to your dvd library anyway considering what the price for the set is going for it's a pretty reasonable bargain...."}

Teke the page Kenneth, he tends to be very often way too geeky for the good of the series. Also Alec Bladwin's character is way over the top and somewhat unrealistic (OK, it is a comedy series) but he has improved over Season 1.

A funny, down to earth intelligence officer/agent has been \"burned\"  by his handlers (declared unreliable) and is confined to Miami where he must work under the table as an \"investigator\" while he figures out his situation.  Its not really that deep or ground breaking, but it works as an original series.Caveat, I saw this at the store for 39.99, regular price.  That is too high, don't pay more than what is advertised here.  Show is great, but you only get 11  42 minute episodes and the video quality is mediocre at best.  25.99 is a fair price."}

Osborne and the poor son of a masseuse Finn Earl are two peas in a pod, and Osborne sees that right away. Osborne has already triumphed, thanks to a little blackmail on the part of his grandfather, and you get the impression that Finn will do the same after surviving a very rough coming-of-age summer with the Osbornes and his ex-drug addict mother. It's about tribal behavior in a \"fierce\" primitive tribe studied by his biological father and tribal behavior in a \"fierce\" robber baron family headed by Osborne:  sex, love, murder, rape, jealousy, and all that human stuff that doesn't change no matter what costume you happen to be wearing or how much money you have."}

But the laughs and the sex scenes become fewer as the story unfolds and the Duchovny character's inner sadness and longing for permanent connection becomes the dominant theme.I found this series a rather effective critique on the emptiness of the fast-lane L.A. world the characters inhabit and of our insistence on eternal youth which inhibits people growing up to become true adults."}

It's very unpoliitcally correct in a bad way , but it also does depict how nasty some people are. Meth of course is destroying whole communities , so the writers picked the most offensive drug they could for the character to fall into. After all breaking bad pot man wouldn't be that offensive would it?  The acting is great , with  emmies' won by cast members over the years.

It's not your typical zombie flick, per se. It's not your typical stripper flick either. It's not even a horror comedy. Yet, whatever it is, it is strangely a pretty good movie. The story has something to do a with a zombie-like virus passed along to a member of a military strike-team, who then escapes to a strip club where he bites Jenna Jameson, who the bites some more people.  Robert Englund plays a strip club owner who realizes that there's a lot of money to be made in zombie strippers - until everything goes wrong.Oddly enough, I still don't know what to say about it except to see this movie.

I have to admit, they're pretty hot. Jenna was a lot hotter before she became a twig. WTF???Anyway, the funniest part of the movie is when an Army zombie is eating Jenna Jameson on stage and her boyfriend/hubby whatever Tito Ortiz who is a bouncer at the club runs out the door rather than sticking around to protect his womern.

I was very satisfied w/ the story, the heavy atmosphere, and the puzzle to be solved. The ending is both terrifying and heart-breaking at once. THE ORPHANAGE deals w/ the agony of tragic loss as well as the supernatural. It is a human story that slowly shifts into nightmare. It is also about the unbreakable bond between a mother and son.

Not your standard 'horror' fare or slasher film and audiences who don't come expecting that may find the story, upon reflection, to be quite seamless, clever and ultimately rather satisfying.  I give it 4.5 stars.  It isn't quite the odyssey that Pan's Labyrinth was (different director, same producer), but for what it sets out to do, it accomplishes much.  The cinematography is top notch, as is the acting.  Crystal clear transfer on the DVD.  A story with a bit of a twist.  A story that may leave you feeling oddly hopeful rather than frightened."}

The Orphanage is similar in pace and scares to that film. It's often what you don't see that scares you the most. Belen Rueda who plays the mother delivers a very strong performance and really holds the movie together. Worth seeing in theaters, even though some people failed to realize it was going to have subtitles and walked out. Don't people find out a little about a film before shelling out $10.00 to see it?

{"label": 0, "raw": "I am a fan of Tobe Hooper who directed the original \"Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" and \"Poltergeist\" but this episode does not live up to his reputation.  The story is blurry, unoriginal and not scary at all. It is a tale that has been told many times before.  An angry demon of the earth, this time oil under the earth, enters the body of a father and the son witnesses his father brutally kill his mother.  Now years later it's time for the evil spirit to inhabit the son's body and cause mayhem and destruction throughout the town he lives in. The story has no real clarity, and there is a no suspense or thrills just mass confusion in the film and outside the film as a viewer.  It looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute.  If you want some originality and horror watch Hooper's Season 1 contribution called \"Dance of the Dead\" and save yourself some time and money here."}

As a member of AA for 13+ years I can tell you the family problems related to this are very real life and they show much of this with enough humor to make me appreciate the honesty.

The reason why it was canceled?  CBS didn't have much respect for the genre and kept switching it on different days.  It never found an audience because it never came on the same day each week. Football and other events kept delaying the broadcasts.  I believe it was done to get rid of the show.  Now you can enjoy them all.  I only wish it was allowed to survive.

The script, however, is only informative if one has never heard of Operation Barbarossa or knows nothing about the Russian Front. Additionally the prose is really purple, since the writer seems to think it enhances the dramatic content to repeat words. Eg: It was a drive that was relentless. Relentless. RELENTLESS. But the worst part of it was the dissonant score- imagine Nora the piano playing cat, only without the cute fluffiness. At the end of both volumes the endless pinging of the piano keys was relentless, Relentless, RELENTLESS.  Recommended with the sound off."}

Danny De Vito was allways a problem because his character is not likeable at all in this series. The titles of the episodes say all: Mac and Charlie Die, Who Pooped the bed, Sweet Dee has a heart attack.... It does simply not hold up to the standards of the first seasons, which were irreverent funny. The worst bar in Philadelphia episode is the best and goes quite over the top with the gang kidnapping a restaurant reviewer for sacking their pub.

I was never much for over done drama (same thing that made or broke Battlestar Galactica, for the most part), thats why they have daytime soaps.  Again, good show and its worth watching, you just might have to struggle through some of it."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I thought the premise of the series was  ridiculous.  These rebels are criminal low lifes whose lives appear to be caught up in a Walter Mitty hero fantasy about being bad boy bikers.  The script throws in glimpses of male bonding, emotional depth, and odd paradoxical integrity, which comes off as absurd given that they're just a bunch of middle aged wannabes caught up in an arrested development of their teens.  If the storyline didn't attempt to be taken seriously, it could have been a good comic satire."}

This show has everything, mc chases/action for the guys, drama for the women.  Character depth and depiction in this show are spot on amazing for law enforcement and the the mc clubs/criminal elements of show.  The actors really pull in the muscle and deliver their characters authentically.  The way the mc club deals with other gangs, similar to politics.  Setting is also realistic depicting the urban decay of our Nor-Cal roadways, and urban buildings.  I just wanna know where all the award nominations are for this show.  Motorcycle Clubs are about the men, but the women in this show really pull their weight, especially Katey Sagal.

Then there is the comparative morality of corrupt politicians, cynical, venal government agencies and morally compromised businessmen. So they get into all of these wild escapades, nothing is ever what it seems and the SOA is always about 15 minutes from death, destruction and prison as one scheme after another backfires. Someone should make a reel of the many \"oh s***\" moments in the series, whenever someone says it, it has already hit the fan. But it is never boring. I guarantee that if you buy the series you will be up all night watching it, simply to see what happens next. Highest possible rating."}

You actually see each character develop and you can actually relate to their plight in some strange way. You kind of start rooting for the characters although socially and morally there actions need to be condemned. Definitely more graphic and explicit than any show I have ever scene.

The only real problem with Boston Legal globally was besides the 3 main characters, the continuous change in the secondary characters between all seasons. This led to the loss of mainly some great female characters that were indispensable. This was in line with Ally McBeal where characters disappeared between seasons without much explanation. This has been the main problem with the series since it has not permitted continuity. Otherwise the series has been perfect. The acting from Shatner, spade and Bergen is simply wonderful.

Yes, Morse is the best. Morse is single and gives Lewis frequent problems as Lewis is married with two children. He has to really juggle the life to try to get home to the family.

As a drunk, Tim Hutton seems to drag the show down because he is the leader of the group and impacts all the characters, so perhaps he is playing his role perfectly?!?Maybe next season, the characters will show more life.

You see just enough of their private lives to be interesting and engage your interest without overwhelming the show.  Enrico Colantoni, is a spectacular actor and never disappoints no matter the role.  I have seen him in Veronica Mars, Just Shoot Me, and most recently in Person of Interest.

I never would have thought the show would work with Tim Roth in the lead but he's terrific as are the other 2 main characters--you want to know what's going to happen to these people.

He undergoes a transformation from being frustrated with his fate of performing for small-town America, to finding the his big break didn't necessarily bring him what he most needed. Meanwhile, Colin Hanks (Tom Hank's son) plays a young man searching for himself after dropping out of law school. Ultimately, this movie isn't a slapstick comedy and you probably won't find yourself laughing out loud. Nonetheless, it has some funny moments and is a breath of fresh air compared to the stale comedies Hollywood has been producing (with their utterly predictable plots).I found myself unable to predict where exactly the story was going or what would happen next to Buck Howard - and I loved that.

The lack of social empathy is more like 30 rock where only a few characters are singled out for elaboration but they are so over-caricatured and ancillary that they are unrelatable as humans: in Ted this is the zany scientists and cold ceo and in 30 rock Jenna, Tracy, the paige and the writing staff."}

To that end, the last episode made the whole season a worthwhile purchase ($15.00 Walmart, which had seasons 1-13 to my surprise). In Dances with Smurfs, Cartman, plays a Glenn Beck character doing the morning announcements (the kid who was doing the announcements was killed in a case of mistaken identity.) Cartman hounds Wendy, the school president, and blames her for every wrong at the school."}

This movie makes you feel really uncomfortable regarding her dad getting struck by lightning and becoming dumb, and when she hears that someone has a ticket to see Elvis, she is forced to stip nude for him and dance and sing 'Hounddog' If you wanna see Dakota Fanning get raped, you'll love HOUNDDOG!!!"}

To filmmakers, the south isn't a region or a people or culture, but a genre that can only be pushed and mutated into exercises in human depravity and despair.  I'm sure there are people who live horrible lives...but that's everywhere.  And I really don't think another film about addictions, poor white trash, and rape is necessary.  Just me.The acting is good.  The film looks very professional.  The writing...well...life really sucks east of Aspen and Hollywood."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "Pretty family friendly most of the time!  It's a fun show with teen mermaids filmed at Australia's SeaWorld but has enough drama & mystery to stay interesting & refreshing.  Sometimes characters go in and out of episodes too much but perhaps that's necessary with such a large cast. (For example, Rikki's boyfriend Zane might be on episode 3 then you won't see him or that storyline till episode 7.)  I like that there is practically no bad language and violence to a minimum and that it focuses on good things like friendship, responsibility, loyalty etc.  My young kids and my teens like it and I do too, so thumbs up!!  My mom actually watched the show & recommended it to us since she liked it so well.  But remember, it is a teen drama...there will be corny moments...overall, 4 stars."}

And Emma gets a new boyfriend.But this season pretty much revolves around a new girl in town named Charlotte (played by Brittney Byrnes) and she sets her love sights on Lewis.  She seems nice enough at first but soon becomes a threat to all 3 girls, which gets even worse when Charlotte herself becomes a mermaid with all 3 powers in her own possession, escalating to quite the mermaid showdown.Of seasons 1-3, this is my favorite."}

I also like how candid Leslie Knope's character is. Like other shows each character is known for a behavior of theirs, like April is snarky, Jerry gets picked on by everyone, and Chris is always optimistic. I began watching season three online, so thanks to Amazon Prime I can start from Season One. Since this is similar to the Office anyone who enjoys that show should try out this one. Another similar show is the Mindy Show in regards to a practice that she serves as a doctor for among other doctors. Both shows are about women in different professional fields and their trials and tribulations in being successful. Currently season six is on NBC and hopefully the series will enjoy more seasons."}

He holds this film together. I loved all the different layers of his character and the troubled woman he falls in love with. The two characters are given no name which I didn't even noticed until the credits rolled at the end! The 'man' tries to help the 'woman' out of her isolated existence, come to terms with her horrible past, and learn to love again. Good Dick is a strange but intriguing love story, definitely worth buying! Enjoy."}

The under used Jason Ritter and Marianna Palka are so interesting to watch here and although not really a comedy, it will make you laugh a lot of the time.This story about a guy who begins to fall in love with a very withdrawn girl with severe trust issues is not your average love story, but it has a refreshing quality and the two stars are completely engaging. If you like romance films with a little more creativity, then this is certainly worth your time."}

In the time they were there, they only caught one fish, yet they are near water almost all the time. I did develop an interest in how this would turn out, and you will, too. The ending is a little contrived. They manage to catch a train out of the wilderness, and somehow it pulls into a station where all their families are waiting to greet them! How did that happen?

The creators tapped into Broadway stars to pull this one off and it worked.  The nice thing about the songs is that they don't stick to one decade.

Dark Blue is so far away from that, thats its easy to see why it didn't last. More of a vehicle for its star, the show drops the ball from the opening scene.

I wouldn't want to run into him on the street.This show has been some of the most engaging television I've seen in ages.My thanks to all who brought us this remarkable show."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This was a new kind of series that I was sure would last many seasons but alas, it was pulled and we will never get to see an ending.I would put this up there with the X-Files as far as new thinking and breaking new ground in a series. We have more than enough series about police, attorneys, and spies and so this was a very welcome break in that mundane dribble that infests the cable channels now.A shame, real shame, to cut a series like this without giving closure to the loyal fans that stood by it all those years."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "While overall I found the series to be mostly entertaining there were a few characters who really grated me with their apparent lack of importance to the series story or their characters personalities in the show itself, mostly with the apparent uselessness of Claire and the conniving mother of the Petrelli brothers who you really wished the character Sylar would kill ruthlessly but which never happened. This season like with the third tried to give us a new foil to match the villain Sylar with dubious results but much better then the third season second villain who at the end was pathetically killed off easily,  the fourth season new villain could have been better written but all in all wasn't truly horrible.  If you have the seasons 1-3 I would actually say just stick with those as while you can add on the fourth overall the episodes were pretty bland and though you'll get some more heroes episodes to watch you'll still probably feel a little cheated regardless."}

I think too much time was spent on Ron Livingston's soulful looks, and Laura Harris is getting too old to be simpering like an ingenue.  The flashbacks started getting irritating, too-why not just start at the beginning?  By the time I finished watching the season, I was kind of glad there wasn't a second season, though I might have watched it just to see what they'd do with the &#34;baby&#34;."}

Since Amazon is not selling the additional 5 programs that were not made available I had to search the internet until I could see them free but bad quality.

A dumb doughnut eating cop (Joe Hansard) is investigating the whole thing.The film has high camp value. The dialouge is far better than the delivery. Initially the movie uses camera angles so you don't see the killer, but after a few kills they show the killer which most of us have figured out.

The acting is superb and the direction and production keep the viewer coming back episode after episode.  This series is unique in that MPD or Dissociative identity disorder (DID) has never been approached before on television besides the old movie Sybil.  United States of Tara gives a much more realistic view of how a typical family might deal with this.It's dark, it's funny and I found myself watching episode after episode in almost one sitting.

The shortcomings (in my opinion only) are that not all mental health patients should disregard medications that may make them less stressful on the caretakers. I understand the husband agreeing to the absence of medication but I am not sure I like the idea of the children (who were not asked their opinion before birth) having to find coping mechanisms for dealing with a parent who is so obviously ill; I speak from personal experience on the subject.  If the character wanted children than the price of using moderating medication until they are adults (and able to understand the consequences fully if the choice is offered at that time) should have been paid. It is very complex situation and hardly fair to try to cover it in a one hour tv show but at least it brings the conversation forward and, as I said I applaud the effort.  Thank you."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I think the first season was better. The crimes/mysteries were more common place in that you see people lie all the time for the crimes depicted in season 1.  In season 2, the storyline gets more grittier, more dangerous for Dr. Lightman and his team as they confront liars who will do anything to cover up their lies. There's a hint of unrealism in season 2, only because civilians like LIghtman and his team hardly ever get called to go confront people in dangerous places such as Afghanistan or the site of a collapsed mine shaft where anything could blow up at any second. Psychologists like him and his team still realistically work under controlled conditions, either in their office or through videos and one-on-one interviews. Otherwise, though, season 2 is still exciting."}

We get to follow the partners of a very successful Madison Avenue advertising agency during the eraly 60's and we see the impact of the Kennedy assasination on these career-oriented people.

Eventually, it all comes together, but not until the end. I didn't quite see it coming, either. I had to pause this a few times because I got bored and went off to do something else. It's not a very compelling story, despite the big-name cast. I did like the indie soundtrack which fit the lonely images of Mexico, southern California and Washington state very well."}

Believable, tragic and hopeful story line.  The acting was top drawer. The setting is unusual and interesting.  Jennifer Lawrence plays the main role as a teenager and Charlize Theron plays her as a grown woman.  There is a bit of a Capulet and Montague family feud going on, which is actually understandable in this case, which dooms the young romance."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "The maddening part of this movie (besides the gratuitous sling-shot killings of birds) is the fact that Mariana's mother is perfectly justified in having an affair, but Mariana is too immature to understand why.  And it's clear that her mother's lover adores her, and she him.  Ironically, the same physical deformity that turns off her husband causes her lover to care for her even more.  So the ensuing tragedy--the \"burning plain\" of the title--and Mariana's tragic life after that, are both avoidable.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it's a slow, meandering story that seems to be leading nowhere until it all comes together.  A worthwhile film. I only gave it 4 stars because the actors who played the younger versions of the main characters didn't much look like the adult version, and not that many years had passed."}

At that point everything makes sense. I'm trying not to give anything away so details about the story won't be given here. I would suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys something different."}

Among other things, it clearly shows what can happen if your past defines you or is something so intense that it never lets you go.  Awesome cast, amazing performances by them all."}

Everyone now must have a personal ID card in order to buy anything, get transportation or enter any where, including your own home.  He meets his brother's wife and is instantly attracted to her.  What follows is a story of intrigue and conspiracies that keeps you guessing as to who the good guys and the bad guys are.  The end of this 5 episode series is as unpredictable as the rest of the series.  Four stars only because I really wanted to see another season."}

People who study the Bible must wonder how the Jews came from the temple service to the present practice of the Synagogue. The series treated this part of Jewish history very well.

However, I'd like to point out a few things on the down side; 1- the murders are extremely grizzly with lots of blood and mutilated corpses at every episode, which is in sharp contrast to the supposedly peaceful villages where they occurred. 2 - The reasons that caused the villagers to murder others are very trivial and petty most of the time. 3 - The murderers are the most unlikely people; like an 80 years old woman who is a retired school teacher, an angel-faced 14 years old girl etc. people who have lived clean and decent lives in a nice peaceful village suddenly go berserk for some petty reason and start butchering their neighbors.So obviously the writers achieve their goal - it's just about impossible to guess who done it, but it made me feel let down in the end of every episode.Anyway, like I said - it is an enjoyable show never the less, just take off your thinking cap and enjoy the blood fest..."}

In episode 02 of lizard man a person will die and the actor who played a rescue man will have a wide smile on his face before/ right after proposing that the person is deceased. This season does have repeating monsters, but I think it was still all right. At times when we get to see the monster usually it's done too cheesy and the plot at times is also ridiculous. Like for example in the last episode, in total darkness, in total madness a guy who made hoax, told his friend to get separated to find another person and meet in 20 minutes. Seriously considering what was supposed to be happening no idiot would do that and no smart man alike. Would like to see season 3 and how different it is. No high hopes.

The plot is based on a \"sanctuary\" developed to protect and study \"abnormals\"--those creatures with extraordinary powers and curses who could be compromised, exploited by scientists or other abnormals or creatures who pose a threat to the world.  While the premise is interesting, the stories often become sentimental and are verbally relayed rather than revealed through action.  Interesting concept but it needs much more depth, internal conflict, and complications to be compelling for viewers."}

It is shaping up to be the evil aliens (who really look awful instead of beautiful) against the good guys (FBI agent, priest, etc., as rebels).  The entire show this time advanced that premise rather than developing other aspects.  I wish the aliens weren't so unrelievedly beautiful on the surface and evil underneath too.  It doesn't leave much room for interesting stories other than good guys vs. bad guys.  The only thing I enjoyed this time was looking at the beautiful alien Anna and the neat way she could try on outfits virtually.  I doubt I will watch this next week.  I think I will stick with FlashForward and Fringe as my sci fi of choice this season.  Save your money."}

It is irritating because if the blu-ray player is on pause and shuts down for lack of activity, it resets the disc and we have to start over.Aside from that little problem, this is one great series, solving a new case each episode, and yet having an on-going story in the background.

I highly recommend Star Trek to everyone. This movie exceeded all my expectations and more.My favorite characters in the movie are Jim Kirk and Bones. Both of the actors who portrayed said characters did an amazing job and in my opinion made the movie even more amazing. All of the other people in the movie were also very good too.  I especially liked Scotty.  He is a hoot!What are you waiting for?  Go and see the movie!!!"}

I went along with a few friends to see this, and while I really enjoyed the first forty minutes, the rest of the film was rather weak. I didn't care for any of the characters. Maybe it's just me. Science fiction is my least favorite genre. I can say this: the acting was well done. I was surprised by how good they were. Bravo to the actors. As for the rest of the film, well, lets just say I won't be seeing it again.See it if you must. Trekkies will get a lot more out of the film than I did. In fact, I'm sure they'll have a blast."}

The pace is exciting without being too overstimulating and frazzling like many of the other kids shows on today. The color, the selection scheme is aesthetic, not gaudy and tacky as are some of others. The Yellow hat character and others are charming and the show is overall respectful and informative add on shows great respect and forgiveness for George. We love the reality segments as well. Curious George is just so darn cute and the show superbly done. The kids love it."}

If you're unfamiliar with the show, it's an animiated comedy about a dysfunctional spy agency in NYC with the mother of the main character running it, with some excellent background characters as well. Every episode is great in its own way and are just as fun upon multiple viewings. There's even some decent continuity between the episodes here and in later seasons. Often times the first season of new shows are good enough to keep you watching but really starts to shine as it progresses, but Archer has been great on many levels since the first ep and is just as good or better than more recent ones. If you're a fan of animated comedy or spy-satire get this and you won't be disappointed."}

A host of quirky characters with kinks that defy even advanced geometry, excellent art and animation, and scripts whose throwaway lines are better than most contemporary fiction are just some of the selling points.

He doesn't have to say much, his facial expressions tell it all. I've throughly enjoyed all the Foyle's War episodes. The plots are good and the actors are exceptional. The plots have a British slant and it's interesting to see the war from that point of view."}

I really didn't want to see more of the same. This is very different, its about people, well one man, Christopher Foyle, and what happens in his life while he masterfully solves crimes. You can watch his process while he solves the current mystery (the UK, especially in the small villages, is rife with murder it seems) all the while trying to do his bit in the war effort. If you like well-acted British crime drama, try it."}

When reading the original books, he is exactly what one envisions Poirot to be, making the films spring to life. And it doesn't hurt that the production company takes such care to make it a period piece, with housing, furnishings, costumes, manners, even idioms of speech, complete to the time frame.

My favorite scene shows the two men in Poirot's kitchen washing dishes.The second mystery involves several flights Poirot would rather not take, a blackmailer, and too many suspects with perfect alibis (\"I didn't know she was going to be murdered.\").The third mystery is a heady mixture of confusion when too many seemingly insignificant people are murdered.I can't get enough of these excellent productions.

Suchet makes the formerly somewhat stuffy Poirot, especially as depicted in old movies, not as endearing as he is in these Masterpiece Theatre creations which make you want to invite this little man into your home and watch his &#34;little gray cells&#34; go to work. The series just gets better and better. My third wish is that it could go on forever. it is so good."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I greatly admire Dame Agatha Christie and her wonderful work with the amateur detective genre but can take Poirot only in small doses. That being said, David Suchet and the wonderful actors in this series make it sparkle. I always think Suchet makes the obsessive-compulsive personality well-defined and am glad too that another wonderful actor Tony  Shaloub did the character in &#34;Monk&#34; that humanizes the condition. The realization that every person with such personality traits is not insufferable is nice. But Poirot's character really fits the period of the writing well and Suchet is brilliant. The episodes seem to me faithful to the stories and the era is captured with amazing detail in sets and wardrobe. It strikes me as a truly professional labor of love. I enjoy watching the series but this is a series where more than one episode at a sitting becomes cloying for me. I can appreciate it more in smaller doses."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "This is the best made television out there. No American made show or series comes close. The dialogue, the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting, locations and cinematography and characters are top of the line. The staging is staggering in the first six seasons; the quality control falls off in some episodes later on. Perhaps because you get used to an exquisite product watching the first six seasons. Agatha Christie would be proud; maybe intimidated by the way her stories have been brought to life.  Every detail is spared no expense and continuity is unmatched. I can watch these over and over in spite of the fact that I know the ending and who the villain is. If you have never see a Poirot episode it&#8217;s well worth your time to watch. John Strickland is an excellent director and Suchet, and cast is top notch. With a cinematographer like Gavin Finney  casting by Susie Parriss, production design by  Jeff Tessler  and kudos to the entire production team, they are one of the best ever assembled."}

Nobody is call anyone by a disgusting name, no one is going to make repeated bodily function jokes, and no one is going to insult your intelligence. So if you can stand not having those elements in your face for a change, this series is PERFECT.

I enjoy this series immensely because the production companies involved in the creation of the programs seem to strive for perfection. The sets, locations and especially the costumes are superb. The episodes have only one weakness that I can see and that is the dialogue. On extremely rare occasions the characters will use an expression such as &#34;excuse me&#34; to indicate a hearing problem. This practice was not used in that time period for that reason. But I'm majoring in the minors here. All the Poirot programs are wonderful and I recommend them to everyone."}

Each character has a unique, resounding voice. Flawed and genuine, we keep watching, wishing our family had the kind of resolve the Braverman's have.The abundance of characters allows a smooth shifting between each life, allowing more realistic events to provide entertainment, drama and comedy.

How is it that we had not zeroed in on Hinds years ago?  His name was barely known to us before The Eclipse, and we are not sure how we failed to notice his portrayal of Dumbledore's brother in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  We'll even pull Jane Eyre out and watch that one again, now that we know who played Rochester.In this film, my wife and I &#34;discovered&#34; Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, quite belatedly.As the film itself, I am one of those people who want a clearly defined ending or at least a strong implication that one is imminent.

Aidan Quinn plays a boorish married suitor of Lena, the writer, and provides a counterbalance to the quiet, dignified Michael, who's just trying to raise his two children and look after his ailing, depressed father-in-law.

Jet Li did an excellent job in this gritty, dark film. this film concerned itself with brotherhood and love during the wars, and although I would rather have seen a more historic piece, the directors did use some of the historical facts in this movie. It was definitely worth the watch as it really tells a tale that sucks you in. 4 stars simply because brotherhood and love were more important to the story than the actual historical reasons behind the events of the period. This is an excellent film, however, and like so many Occidental movies that include some 'unsolved historical mystery', this one at least attempts to give an answer to the question.

In contrast, the life of a simple soldier, Lucius Verena and his sidekick Titus Pullo live complicated lives in Rome as they try to return to civilian life after the Gallic Wars.

The only thing I didn't like is their portrayal of Cleopatra. But, most of it is not about Cleopatra it really is a about Rome. I do feel their portrayal of various characters such as Cesar and other well know people of Rome is pretty close to how they are portrayed in historical books. They did pick good actors to portray these various characters. They portrayed each character like you would imagine they looked. Sometimes I felt I was there and couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Buy it you will not be dissapointed!"}

It is however, very well done relating the story line without taking too much time in unnecessary (but there is some) sex scenes. Otherwise the graphic nature of the violence is the only other aspect to be aware of as it is not a normal t.v. show that holds back at some level. This show shows it all.... almost.That said, it is well done and worthy of watching all the same -- just go into it knowing that it will not hold anything back"}
{"label": 0, "raw": "I am not a Jane Austen purist and, as such, can enjoy take offs and films of her work that are not entirely accurate.  This is my favorite.  It blends contemporary London life, morals and technology with those of the early 1800's.  It is a \"through the secret door\", trading places feature that further highlights what Jane Austen was trying to say about culture, high and low.  The switch between the two women (remaining nameless, no spoilers here) leads to a revised Pride and Prejudice holding delightful revelations about what customs mean and why they are important.  This is not a serious film, however, more like a romantic comedy, and much of it is very funny.  So suspend your practical takes on anything Austen and go get lost.  You will have a ball!"}

Vincent may appear to be a tough guy, and he can be. He delivers tough news with directness, yet ultimately has a heart of gold. He takes on cases that often have excellent plots and the interaction and caring of his staff is wonderful. This is a mystery/drama above all else, but can be funny and touching at the right times. I only wish there were more episodes."}

But there is a twist, he is going through a rough personal crisis, losing the women he loves to another guy, which causes him all kinds of struggles through out each investigation. This twist makes him very human and makes the series different from the rest. If you enjoy both a good private investigator series and a good drama series, you will enjoy this series."}

The sequel is lame, and heavily censored for obvious potential terrorism reasons. (It's a shame Comedy Central felt the need to censor that episode, but understandable given the times we live in.)

{"label": 0, "raw": "From the bleak, broken world with its tiny personal living spaces and small pleasures, to the twisted plot that our character finds himself drawn into, this little gem is well worth your time. The animation is as strange and intriguing as the picture on the front, with realistic over-sized faces attached to inadequate bodies. The main character's deadpan acting adds a sublime sense of resignation to this futuristic view of life under corporate control. How interesting that this viewing coincides with the corporate destruction taking place off the coast of my state in the Gulf of Mexico. Seeing the power of a huge corporation first hand makes Metropia seem all the more possible."}
{"label": 0, "raw": "A gray and dystopic future, evil megacorp taking over the world and the people in it - OK, that part's been done. 'Metropia' stands out for doing it brilliantly. It's a lot more than that, though.Animation has explored the super-realistic, with just enough success that the discrepancies become especially jarring. This goes farther, well into the surreal. That allows for exaggerations of faces and figures, wide-eyed blankness and evil scowls that wouldn't be phyiscally possible for human actors. And, despite great advances in computer-aided post-production, animators can build their worlds from the ground up in the image they want, with no need to retrofit them into scraps of reality. This movie really does use animation in a novel and very distinctive way.Very enjoyable in many ways. Certainly not one for the kiddies, it scarcely qualifies as as \"adult\" movie - but body-shy viewers might have trouble with brief- and semi-nudity.-- wiredweird"}

{"label": 1, "raw": "Those of you who like tower defense games are likely to enjoy games where creeps get progressively stronger, and towers that are adaptable, upgradeable and offer a variety of armaments. This app doesn't offer much - it is a clunky game that lacks finesse, especially in level and unit design.The most frustrating part is that the towers are slow. They fire a single shot, and then take forever to reload. And thats plenty of time for a herd of bubbles to go whizzing by. Not much of a defense. It takes a while to figure out that you need to build and upgrade power stations to recharge your towers so they can fire more than once. The instructions aren't too helpful, either. The touchscreen is also laggy at times, which adds to the frustration.It might be easier to just include a button that lets you wave a white flag and surrender, rather than wait patiently for inevitable annihilation.There are many better TD games out there. This one is mediocre, at best."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Standard TD game, set your various type of towers, be sure to set-up power stations to keep your towers firing and as you accumulate money you can upgrade or sell and change your towers. Different type towers are needed for different types of baloons traveling the course. Bright colorful graphics show up well on Kindle Fire. There are a dozen or more layouts and about 5 difficulty levels so lots of replay value although I feel the regular price a bit high, in other words I probably wouldn't have paid the price but it's definitely a good app as the free app of the day. Thank you Amazon."}

Now, I will give the poor reviews credit, the developer assumes that you have already played the first version of this game, which is why there are few instructions. But seriously people, giving this game 1 star is like a 10 year old saying the original Super Mario Bros for NES was a crap game. It's OLD people, that doesn't make it bad."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "For everyone saying the towers only fire once, you need to learn how the game works. One of the first things the game tells you is that you need a power station. That is a poor concept, and without the power station your towers only fire once. The power station &quot;recharges&quot; your towers, but can't handle a lot of them unless you upgrade the station. I gave it a one star for no sound, poor instructions, no real options menu, the use of a &quot;power station&quot; that costs a much as a basic tower and is required, and really for just being a bad game.To the devs, if you are going to force the player to use a power station for the towers either lower the cost or raise the amount of gold players start with."}

The music on this channel is also SO annoying, so I really wanted to find a way that I could just quickly look through the channels to find something good. I found a website that worked okay (titanTV) but many of the channel numbers or programs were often incorrect. I got this app just on the off chance that it would work better, and it DOES! It's so easy to use, and (thus far) everything it's said has been right. Fabulous app; a must for any avid TV watcher."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "If your Tv isn't large enough to read the digital guide form where you are, there is, literally, no alternative (not printed on paper).  Truly intuitive, efficient and complete.  It is, by far, my most used application. I am very grateful to have received my Fire as a gift from my wife and to discover this application, just as the void of a Tv guide solution was needed.  I have 100 csble channels and am lucky to find one thing worth watching within a 24 hour period. This app gives you the best possible chance of finding that one episode. My only suggestion would be to add ratings to help search for new favorites - something we all value infinitely on Amazon.  That was, everytime they cancel the only show that doesn't suck (e.g. Prime Suspect, Lie to Me, Medium, etc.) t will be helpful in watching for a new replacement."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have tried so many Sudoku games on paper, web and on my Android Tablet. I wanted to learn the game. I always enjoyed the easier games. But none of the other methods guided me like Enjoy Sudoku has. There are so many hints that I can \"hint\" my way through the most difficult Enjoy Sudoku has to offer. Each time I 'cheat' I learn more about methods to achieve a full correct grid.I didn't know until today that there was a paid version. I have been playing the free version all along. For all my enjoyment I bought the paid version and am still as happy with the results. There is no better game out there! I've tried! Maybe someday I will be able to call myself a Sudoku Master! ;)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I grabbed this app when it was the free app of the day, and it's one that's certainly worth the price. The controls are intuitive, there's variety in difficulty, the highlighting is great (which you can turn off if you want), and the way hints are done is unique- they really are hints, and not just flat out giving you answers. They've actually helped me get better at sudoku in general. I love the autopencil settings- autoerase isn't a feature I'd seen elsewhere."}

(C'mon guys- an ad is by definition obtrusive!)It has a simple, clean interface. The default for the \"Another\" button a new game at the same complexity level as the last one.It does not require network access in order to play.Best of all it runs on my Galaxy Tab 2 just as Amazon's compatability sidebar said it would. I have removed all the other sudoku games from my device, it's that good!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've played this game on the iphone for a couple of years and tried most of the variations offered on their store.  The choices on the android have been limited however I never found this one until Amazon offered it today. I snapped it right up to try so I could offer a quick review.This is a great app for working these puzzles with several options you can switch on or off. I highly recommend it if you like these kinds of puzzles.My iphone app could take a picture of a puzzle in the newspaper and convert it to a playable game. I'd love to try that with the superior camera I have now but this app can't do that.  So, I went with 4 stars."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I play sudoku in a magazine and on my Kindle. 2 previous games were more tedious to use. One occassionally fouled up so that I couldn't even finish the game. This one has 2-3 options for how to use the pencil mark and guess for a square. It also has several helps, which I have an option to use or not at my preference. I do like the option for the software to tell me if there are errors and then if I want them fixed, I tell it to fix, but I don't have to. I also like that when I am working on 7's (for example) all of the sevens on the board are highlighted and all of the 7 pencil marks are also highlighted. This adds another level of testing for accuracy and guessing."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really wanted to like this app. It works great on my Thunderbolt, the music is fine, the graphics are sweet and fluid, and the gameplay is all I had hoped for from a side scroller. The controls petty much killed it for me, though: no matter what you do, the ship lags behind where you tell it to go, and that means you don't shoot the targets, and you eat the incoming bullets.Trusting the life of my little ship and its crew to the accelerometer is as bad an idea as one would expect, but the only other option is to cloak your ship with your finger: an act that does little to hide you from the enemies, but does a fair job of obscuring your view, making this difficult and annoying to play. And at the end of the day, those at not words to describe a game that will keep me coming back for more. Which is sad, because it has everything else going for it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Everything about this game appeals to me except for the controls. I generally don&apos;t like motion control but I gave it a fair shot before switching to the option where you control the ship movement with your finger. That was disastrous. For one thing, you can&apos;t see the ship because your finger completely covers it. That wouldn&apos;t be too horrible, but the nail in the coffin was very poor responsiveness in this mode. \\nToo bad, really. I think they did a fine job making a great looking side scrolling space shooter, but ultimately if you&apos;re like me, you won&apos;t like using motion control in this format. \\n2. 5 stars"}

I told my aunt about it and she loves Word Collapse as well.  Granted it is not the hardest or most challenging word game but it is most definately a different word game to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys word games and does not mind having one that is not difficult when you just need to play something to clear your mind."}

But I always download because I want to be ready to pounce. Even despite the reviews I was like, &quot;Huh, maybe it will still work.&quot;  My dissapointment set in when I went to install it and the permissions were far more reaching than the capabilities of not only the descriptions but the reviews.This app wants to read my messages? It wants to read my system log? Why? It wants unintrusive access to everything on my phone which, if it's replacing the Droid OS, I understand BUT when I look at the reviews and the full capabilities of the app it makes me extremely nervous. It's just this side of jailbreaking my phone as it is, no reason to invite trouble where it isn't needed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I am giving this three stars because I didn't really give it a chance. my qualms with this app were two things: the fact it auto starts, and also that it was a big pain to uninstall on my droid x2. I downloaded it and installed and there was no choice in turning it on or off, it just starts up. then not liking that fact I tried to uninstall it and it wasn't in my app list. might be a great app but I just didn't like the design or functionality of it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I use LauncherPro as my home screen and have grown quite attached to it. But I thought I'd give this one a fair go to see if it was worth considering. If you are tired of your stock home screen then, yes, I think you should give this a look. It seems zippy and allows you a little more customization than some stock home screens allow. The biggest thing that irked me as that it replaced how I turn on my phone (the launch screen, is it called?). It completely replaced it and didn't ask me if it was okay first. Worst yet, I dug around the options and could not figure out how to turn my old screen back on. It was about this time that I gave up on it. Otherwise, I mostly liked what I saw and liked that it offered a lot of options (just not the one I wanted).Worth considering, especially today while it is free, but it wasn't up to LauncherPro status to me."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I feel this launcher is kind of the Winamp among media players. By default it isn't the most beautiful, but you can customize it to death.What I do like:- apps sorted alphabetically in a clear fashion- lots of themes- 5 way switching between homescreens,  would work nice with 5 screensWhat I don't care about:- the recent apps drawer with services and running apps- 5 homescreen. I don't need so many. So it kind of makes the 5 way switching useless- a gazillion themes.  It should look great by defaultWhat I dislike:- it's a lot more sluggish than go launcher ex or the default touching on my phone- themes are pricey. I don't want to pay more for a theme than for the app.- it looks low-def on my screen. And the ui has many inconsistent quality things.- lack of included widgets,  go launcher has great widgets"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have been listening to scanners since they had crystals in them! Now they are trunked and newer scanners are expensive. Then I got a HTC Hero and this app and got the Scanner pro for free when they offered it. You can use it anywhere, anytime. I love both of them, free and pro and you can run them at the same time. If it is busy, it can by messy listening tho, :)But I love everything it does and hope it will do more. I would love to volunteer. Would love WSP too. A must have app for scanner lovers! Never had any problems with the actual app either, lots of work went into it."}

The best time to listen to it is on weekends or holidays. It is very entertaining. Sometimes you just can't stop listening. Very addicting. There are complaints about it running down battery quickly, but I use this app on my kindle fire and it doesn't seem to use any more battery than any other open app. The other nice thing is that you can run this program in the background and still play other games or surf the Internet. I strongly urge you to give this app a try!"}

Wouldn't think much is going on around here, but with the suburbs on one end and farms on the other and several major roadways crossing the county, its busy.  And fascinating.  Enough for me to find the fire station numbers and listen for the sirens.  When nothing else is going on at home and I'm sitting horsing around on my computer, you can be sure that my phone is propped up next to me with this app running.  If I want to, I can choose many, many more local locations or big ones all around.  Still, for me its fun to listen locally."}

I waited and in an hour there were 2 contacts between the dispatcher and a patrol officer.  One about a lost dog and another about some trash.  Each was about 10 seconds.  It did kind of startle me when I heard it.  I thought it best just to remove it.  You may live in a city that has an interesting climate or you are a criminal and want to know when they are coming to your door but that is not me.  Try it you may need it or just enjoy hearing what happening!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I just wanted to see if it works and it does. I took it off because I don't know if it might be illegal in this state as most everything probably is here. Have no use for it anyway. It works and can be adjusted to many different areas at least where I am located. I didn't know so many people were jabbering on the radio so much. I heard Fire, Police and a lot of unidentifiable jabber talk going on even late in the night. An old Ham or CB operator that knew the lingo would enjoy this thing. A friend of mine works in the Fire Department so I will have to find out if I can have this without cops going goofy on me somehow for some reason. Might be useful in an emergency?"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Well after reviewing at least ten different apps within two weeks I finally get to this. Hey everybody want to know what police and firefighters are up to? Then you need scanner radio free at the App store. This app works with the help of wi-fi the thing that most of the world depends on. If you want to know what is going on near you, you can search on the search selection and type in your state, country, city, or zip code and all you have to do is choose one out of the many options that pop up. This app has no lag and will keep you on alert so you know where the bad boys are. So what are you waiting for? The world to end. I don't think so. Its time to get this app because it has your name on it saying download me. Chill out and relax with scanner radio."}

It's ok I guess, it really just depends on where you live and what you are looking to hear on this app.  I would listen in to be nosy and see what kind of 'action' was going on around the city; sometimes I will check out NYC or Chicago or whatever...also, we had some wildfires close to town this summer and I would listen in on the fire dept. channel at times to see if I heard anything the news wasn't putting out.  Many times when the channels get busy they overlap and it's hard to understand.  I have downloaded this on my Kindle and on my Samsung Blaze...both worked fine.  Cheap entertainment app. :)"}

Kudos to the designer and to the volunteers who lend their scanners to provide this app.  The coverage of local police, fire and EMT service seems excellent, and the small ads are not too intrusive.  The site is very easy to navigate and a list of police codes is included.  There is even an archive if you want to review prior dates, but it requires a paid subscription so I haven't checked it out.  I find it hard to tear myself away from the live police chatter, even though it's usually quite routine.  Update 4-27-13 -- The alerts accurately tell you when there are more listeners than usual in a certain area.  Today I listened in on Australia loud and clear.  I'm impressed!"}

I did enjoy listening in on some of the international frequencies it offered , Sydney Australia is a great one ! So for that alone it was worth it but don't be surprised if your preffered area isn't available since many of the places across the US weren't offered for listening ."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I wanted an ap like this to listen to when I don't have access to my scanner, but this won't work because it doesn't offer any of the frequencies that I like to monitor. I only offers a selective group of frequencies, and they are not in my city!

{"label": 1, "raw": "I originally had a Sony E-Reader, so Kindle was not an option but now I have a Lenovo K1 Ideapad and the app is available. While the Kindle app does have some good settings like highlighting a word to get the definition, font size and text, easy sync and great night mode. The formatting leaves a lot to be desired. Bundle books become one long book and all the books I have read have yet to have an option of jumping or returning to a page or chapter. Which come to think of it I have not actually read a book with page numbers, just percent of how much of the book has been read. The free books and having them linked to my Amazon account are a plus but the formatting takes this app from great to just okay."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have used this app on both desktop and android and would rate it as &#34;functional, but nothing to write home about. Had to remove it from my phone, but that was because of RAM problems, not the app itself. It does have a few cool &#34;sister&#34; apps that are separate apps working in conjunction w/ it, but the app itself is about what you would expect. May very well work better on the Kindle hardware, but I don't see the point in purchasing a tablet when I have a smart phone, a laptop, and 2 desktops already. I personally prefer Adobe Digital Editions and the Nook apps (Barnes & Noble), but mostly just because I am more familiar, having used them both first, and I actually would rather have a paper book than any of them. If you need a decent reader app, this one is just as good as the next, so go ahead and try it out, just make sure to comparison shop."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As someone who used to own a kindle, this app falls far behind my expectations. The ability to read books, change font size, turn pages quickly is fine. It's the organization, or lack there of, that drives me crazy. I have no idea which books I've read, which ones I've not read. I can't put them into folders or categories like I could on my kindle. It would be nice to file books I've finished into a separate folder, or if there was a way to  tell which books I've read or not in the list of books. That's really irritating. My kindle fire it told me which books I've opened, and which ones were new. This app doesn't do that. I read at least 5 books a week and need a way to organize them, this app falls short."}

If you need a large font full justification leaves too much space between words especially if you read on a small device.I want to be able to choose my font size.  The difference in sizes really jumps too much.  If I could choose the font size by number it would really help.Without even these basics, I don't find it very useful."}

It's so easy to operate my kids can do it. Even I can do it. Bookmark my page and pick up where I left off with no hassle. Now I can use my tablet for what I bought it for--a portable library. It's so easy to go to amazon, find my book, download it and read. The selection is great, and the prices are way better than say-- driving to a big bookseller to search for and buy a paper ( save the trees) book."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a OK app.  I mean it doesn't do that much.  It surely doesn't have all the features a Kindle reader has.  One day they will upgrade it more so it has more features but in reality Amazon wants you to buy a real Kindle, and not use an app.  Well I did and I gave the real Kindle away.  I got a Samsung Note 2 and that is all I need along with this app.  I am not going to run around with several different devices and the Note 2 does everything and does it well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I used to like Kindle. The app was fast and reliable, and made it easy to read an ebook from Amazon on my Nook Color (with N2A).Then I bought a couple of new Kindle books, and Kindle (the app) would not download them unless I updated the app. The new app starts with a gray sphere and freezes there for a long time. Then it loads, and the default screen is not my library but the Kindle store with recommendations. A few buttons later I finally get to select my book and read it. Meanwhile, the app still doesn't allow you to group the books by topic.This spells the end of Kindle for me. I'll move my books over to Calibre, which doesn't try to sell anything and does allow for sorting books."}

Some may point out that personal documents have delivery fees, but that is only using Amazon's 3G and this app uses our networks. Also, why not let us target our app instead of or along with our Kindle? This would require us to be given a unique @Kindle.com email address, but it could work.I also want the app to sync highlighted notes / clippings from when I read on my Kindle.Finally, I want to be able to highlight and share quotes from my clippings like on my Kindle.This app works, but not better than Aldiko and definitely not better than a real Kindle."}

Many free books by big-name authors available,  with as many as 75 new ones a day (some days 0, 1, 2 etc.) sometimes there is plenty to read,  free or to buy at good prices. Works well, although mine on a DROIDX run sometimes shuts down for no apparent reason. Only capable of using kindle files. Overall, probably my most used program. NOT AS GOOD AS AN ACTUAL KINDLE ! YOU CAN'T DO VIDEO BOOKS, ETC. Limitations. They won't make it much better as they want you to buy a kindle."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "There should be support for reading books download from another source, as well as the ability to use a local dictionary (e.g. ColorDict). The ability to add support for lookup in user defined wikis would be great too.Highlighting text spanning more than one page can be difficult or impossible.  Regarding selection of text, is being able to copy a sentence no more than a few times a day such a problem for publishers? This would be useful for quoting books.Otherwise this app is the best reader I've used, though the first point makes it necessary to have another reader installed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Whenever I want to buy a book from Amazon, I use my Kindle app. I now buy all my books that way.  For example, I have been steadily working my way through Ken McClure's medical thrillers at $5 per book (out of print every way but Kindle for his older books).  It has been a great reading experience.  Ironically, I use my Kindle app more than my sister uses her actual Kindle.  I've also read ebooks on Good Reader and iBooks.  I'd say Kindle holds its own with both of those."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "i originally downloaded this from Android Marketplace. I loved the ease of reading e books with this app so much that I got a Kindle as well for the extra features. It gives me the best of everything. I am never without a book now but have no more piles of books all over. The sync between Android &amp; Kindle works flawlessly for me. Books can be archived online so I can go back &amp; read again. This is great for me because I love series fiction and sometimes forget things before the next book comes out. There is some content you can't get with the app you can with Kindle. I think maybe Amazon wants to keep a few things out of the app so people still buy Kindles. Something else that makes having both worthwhile is that Kindle is totally non glare so you can read outside but not backlit (which is easier on the eyes) while my phone has backlight so I can read in dark/dim light."}

I won't take any stars away for that, but only because there may be an easier way and I'm new to Win8 tablets. (Aren't we all?)

The vendor of the ePad said Kindle would not work without a difficult download of an older version of the app; then an update by replacing it with a new app.  None of that was required.  I just downloaded the Kindle app for Android and it works right out the shoot.  It even does somethings better than the Kindle itself.

I also like how that time is continuously updated (like when I stop reading for a bit and then resume). I suppose I mostly appreciate the percentage of the book already read. Really gives me a true location to where I currently am in the book.. this feature also estimates the time to the end when I open a book that I have already read, basing its estimate on how long it took me the last time to read cover to cover. Not necessarily needed info but nice to know what I average from book to book. This app will stay on my RAZR Maxx until I buy a Kindle Fire later this fall."}

I was in Amazon App store to download a timer for poker when I came across the Kindle app. So I downloaded that as well, while looking to order a new book from one of my favorite authors, I noticed that he had written several short stories for the Kindle only. I ordered the stories, and was delighted with the ease of operation in downloading to the tablet, the ease in reading while in bed, on the couch, room lights on or off. I am definitely a believer in e-books now. I still like print books for the beach and pool, but the Kindle is great for the other times that weather is not an issue for electronics. Definitely recommend this to all the readers out there."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Works very nice for my Kindle books, but haven't figured out how to (or if it's even possible) to have the computer read it like it did on my Kindle Keyboard.  Doesn't come up often, but I've kind of wished I had it available a couple of times.  That's the only drawback I see.It is very easy to navigate, and easy to put items on or take item off your device.  Actually, it's easier than with my old Kindle!  Easy to download your books from the cloud.  Easy, easy, easy!Love it!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've had the Kindle app on my EVO phone since last November, about ten minutes after I got the phone. The app works smoothly, and I've had no problems with it at all. I enjoy having some books with me on my phone; it's surprising how often I read something using the Kindle app on my phone when I'm waiting for an appointment somewhere. I still carry and use my Kindle 3, but this app has turned my phone into a very handy supplement to the Kindle. Syncing to the \"furthest location read\" between and among my Kindle-equipped devices has always been easy and accurate."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have this on my Arnova tablet and it works well.  Very easy to use and understand.  Amazon is one of my fav sites and has made my life so much easier.  My only complaint is that on my tablet I cannot read the first or second sentence on the top of each page b/c there is a status bar there.. At one point last week it went away and i had the book on my entire screen but i have no idea how i got it that way and it hasn't happened since then.  If anyone knows how to fix this i would greatly appreciate the help!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I loved this app and until recently it was amazing.  Now there are two issues currently affecting it.1.  Books which were recently read will come up as no longer being recognized.  It will then either require me to attempt to open it several times, or delete and redownload the book.2.  The time left grows significantly during the reading of each chapter.  I will go from 15 mins left on the first page of a chapter to 36 minutes left on the last page of the chapter.  I know my reading speed hasn't changed, but about every 2-3 pages, it likes to add a minute to the remaining time.I am currently using the Note 3, however the 2nd problem also existed on the Evo 4G I was using for a bit.Once these two items are taken care of, I will be more than happy to change it back to a 5-star rating, as this truly is one of the better reading apps."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Why??? Runs horribly now even on a dual core and is literally 10 times larger than a year ago and for what? Please, please stop this and optimize this app!!!! I hate giving it one star but there is no excuse for this. And WHY do you store the book data in the app/system space instead of of user/sdcard storage space? AND when one deletes (archives) a book, why doesn't the app remove it from local storage? Why are these very basic housekeeping functions and storage decisions so poorly implemented? :("}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I must admit to HIGH frustration when I first download it and couldn't get it to transfer playlists -- only the songs -- which would have made it useless because you can transfer songs for free without an app with just a USB.  Even restored Kindle to new condition and tried again. Customer service was prompt in responding and suggested I download their (free) music player and use that one instead of Amazon's.  Worked like a charm and now this is JUST what I needed.  Maybe I missed it, but never saw that piece of advice in my installation instructions, so I would recommend they add that so people like me don't get confused (I'm pretty tech savvy too, so if I didn't get it, I'm sure others would benefit from that bit of info!).  Still I'm happy enough to go from 1 star to FIVE stars.  They got it right!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app wouldn't download my songs to my 16gig SD card reliably, and when it did, it was epic fail. It &lt;&lt;NEVER>> imported all my music even though I checked carefully to ensure I hadn't gone over the level. It may have been something I am doing wrong, but I doubt it. The app asks you where you want the stuff loaded to, then arbitrarily decides where to load the stuff to. Save your time and money. I'm looking for a better solution, and in the meantime, I'm doing this the old-fashioned way. Hey! CDs!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love the game Mancala but can't find good apps for the game.  This one would be great if there were template options and it would stop freezing.  I play as a single player and if the game wants the computer to go first it freezes.  I have to close the game out and restart it several times so that the player goes first, when the player goes first the game doesn't freeze.03/05/13A recent app update by developer has RESOLVED the freezing issue, so I have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "For what it's worth, this is a pretty awesome radio app. There are over 50,000 radio stations of multiple genres to surf through, and I think that number will only grow. I actually hope it does, for likeTuneIn Radio Prothere are a lot of local stations that I do not have access to, so for the momentiHeartRadiois the only one that I can listen to all local, and even some elsewhere that is ineligible for me onXiiaLive Proor TuneIn.The interface is a breeze to get through and to get used to. You can search songs, you can favorite songs; you can even tag songs, which is something that I haven't seen before. Overall, the app alone is pretty good. I just hope it gets improved by making more stations readily available."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "UI is very refined and easily usable.  There are so many channels that it's going to take a long time to listen to them all.  Plenty of choices for everyone.The audio queues for connection and disconnection are nice when you don't have the screen on and wonder why your music stopped playing.  Doesn't seem related to the application at all because some of the channels were flawless and others disconnected quite a bit.  (Mostly those from across the world like Ukraine).Good app, thanks for picking a good one this time Amazon."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Best radio app! Was wonderful on my phone, works beautifully on my tablet as well.Very large selection of Christian stations, which is sooo hard to find on most apps (sadly). Feature PACKED! Has customizable sleep timer, alarms to wake to any station, favorites, backup, bluetooth, search...and on and on. Can't find any flaws, nothing missing here! Got as a FAOTD, but one of the select few really worth paying for. Nice UI as well. If  you're looking for an all-around radio app, this is it!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm still very new to the whole e-anything. This popped up on the free app of the day, so I grabbed it. Right off the bat I played with it for a few minutes till I got a handle on how to maneuver. I made the kids laugh when I put the ear buds in my ears and danced to Celtic music around the house with my Kindle Fire stuck in my back waste-band.  Huge choice of streaming music from every genre from around the world. Since it was one of my new experiences in the e-music or streaming music, I'm hooked. Get this app, YES, recommended. ."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Quality sound, easy to find music can be sorted by artist, genre, or song title.  Each genre seems to have a good variety of stations to choose from.  It is also easy to switch from station!  It is easy to use and you can leave it turned on while you switch to reading a book or a magazine.  This offers every type of music from classical to country.  There is nothing about this app that I did not like.This is one of my favorite apps."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this for the free app of the day since it had Shoutcast capabillities. It's smooth, awesome and works well. I recommend it. There are free radio apps that are good, too, but this one seems to run more smoothly and you actually get Shoutcast stations, which are hard to find free like this on Android. Not that this is free now.I like how the search feature searches songs that the stations are playing instead of the station name, but it would be nice if I could search the station name, too."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I liked it right after I downloaded it. I liked it when I was playing around with it. Easy to use and maneuver. Had problems connecting to a lot of stations. Had problems triong to figure out how to stop it and exit out of the app completely. I just ended up pausing it ans leaving it paused, until the middle of the night. It unpaused and scared me half to death, beings it was close to my head. I paused again and set it down. It unpaused once more. I, then, decided to uninstall  it. Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "App and reviews sounded great, esp. for free, but it never worked for me.  I downloaded it twice, uninstalling in between and rebooting phone, and still kept getting the weird 'ball bouncing on hard floor' sound and 'Android Media console died' message no matter what radio station I tried.  I got one to stream for a few seconds but it kept losing the connection and going on and off.  I'm on Verizon 4G with a very strong signal. so it's just an app that won't work for me."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Thanks Amazon for making this app free today, but it's not worth it. I was intrigued by the equalizer, but you really can't tell THAT much of a difference on the Samsung Epic. The streaming is choppy (cuts out every 5-10 sec), and the app slows down other apps, e.g. words lag when typing on Tweetcaster.I also am confused and perhaps somewhat overwhelmed by what station to choose. The stations listed are the actual station names but don't really have a good description. You just have to assume the stations will play within the genre. I definitely prefer Pandora, which plays the next song based on songs you like and stays within the genre (or you can create your own station). The streaming on Pandora also isn't choppy. Maybe others have had better luck with this app, but I've already uninstalled it from my phone."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm a huge music and radio streamer. I have 4 apps I already use for varying proposes being Pandora, Grooveshark, TuneIn and 8 Tracks. This app is particularly well built and functions rather well. It's got a great UI and it's easy to understand. There's plenty of stations to listen to. Found local and international stations I'm already a fan of. All that said this app simply doesn't bring anything to the table that I don't already have the ability to do and doesn't pack enough to replace any of the apps I have. I'd recommend any of the 4 aforementioned apps before recommending this one but this is one solid app in it's own right. 4 stars!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Very enjoyable app.  Have listened to it for a few months before giving it a review.  As the days have progressed, it has gradually replaced my shortwave and hd radios with more stations to choose from and no need to play the antenna dance.Works great on the k-fire original.  Can run all day if the battery is fully charged.  I find new, enjoyable, unexpected stations almost every day.  Good sound.The only problem occurs when I fastforward too quickly through my list of saved stations.  The programme freezes.  Just restart your device and remember to wait until the station is fully buffered before moving to another channel and you'll be back to business as usual.Well worth the purchase price.  Give it a try."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I played all the levels and didn't find that there was any bias to the computer rolling more doubles than myself....also, I only consider myself to be a slightly above average player and find it rather easy to beat the computer at level 5.  So either I'm a better player than I think I am or the game's AI  could stand a little improvement. That said, the game is an enjoyable time killer and seems to work flawlessly without any bugs or glitches.  The operation and animation is smooth and the controls are quite easy to use on even the smallest screened smartphone.  I'll be keeping this one in my game apps....at least until I find something better."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I miss playing backgammon and this is a nice way to be able to play when I can't find a partner.  I enjoy playing and winning, so I just use the easier levels.  Occasionally the CPU will get some strange runs of doubles but looking at the stats shows that it is not that bad.  For people really wanting a challenge, I would suggest using a high difficultly level.  It makes some pretty stupid moves, like moving pieces in the home area to a better take off position while there are still pieces outside of the home area.  But maybe the harder difficultly level corrects that."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a great little app - can be very addictive and has definitely helped my \"real time\" backgammon skills, I don't think there is a day that goes by that I don't play a few quick games, usually before going to sleep.  Much better than watching the late night news!  Highly recommend this for experienced backgammon players to sharpen their skills, or for beginners to learn the moves that you should automatically think of when you throw the dice and your numbers come up.Friends have commented that my skill level is approaching deadly :)  of course, I haven't told them why.  LOVE THIS APP. almost as much as I love my Kindle Fire!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really enjoy backgammon.  I remember playing it frequently with my dad, learning strategy....I have many reviews concerning this app and the &quot;AI cheats&quot;, especially at higher levels, is very common.Here are my stats after 61 matches played at level 4:Me  CPUMatches won -  56.  5Rounds won.  -  385  226Total Pts Scored -  669  488 (I ran up the doubling cube to 64 one game &amp; lost by 300+)Opponent Pcs Hit -  1297  1225Doubles Rolled -  2067  2009I have learned how the AI 'thinks' and have USED STRATEGY to defeat it.  Now, with that said, I don't play level 5 since I cannot seem to 'crack' the AI's [cheating]."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Unlike many games, the ads on this one do not bother me and I do not find them intrusive. This free version of backgammon is easy to play, but still challenging. It seems as if the computer \"learns\" from my moves; at least this is how I see it and it makes the game more challenging.  I have it on my phone and Kindle Fire. Many games look too small on a cell phone, making them difficult to play, but this one is not so it makes a good diversion while waiting in line or when I am sitting around, waiting at places such as an auto repair shop or doctor's office."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is an excellent version of backgammon.  Very easy to play or undo your moves.  Although, sometimes it really looks like the CPU is cheating, I do not believe it does.  I have beat this game so many more times than I have lost and I have played at level 4, a lot.  Plus, I have played many other backgammon computer games &amp; none compare to this one.  The higher the level the more the CPU uses classic strategy moves and it also hits your piece more, but that goes with any good board game.  All things considered this is a worth while game to down load and purchase."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I just loaded the checkers app by this developer and loved it so went looking for more apps by them and found backgammon.  Years ago I used to play daily and entered public tournaments (we were not elite players - just players who were obsessed with backgammon).  However I have not played a lot recently and am not familiar with all the online games or other apps.  I played the app at the most difficult setting and found it worked well and was fun to play.  The app works like a full tablet sized app on my ASUS Transformer tablet.  This app looks good (not as richly colored as checkers but still nice), the pieces move smoothly (no lagging), and the board lights potential moves.  Nice app in my opinion!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love playing backgammon but I have a hard time finding people in my house that like to play it as well. I love having this app on my Kindle Fire. It plays smoothly, offers five levels of difficulty and and can be a challenge.I tend to play risky and most of the time it pays off. But the programming gets the best of me sometimes and I have to yell at my Kindle and tell the game is it not playing nicely. Even though I often play mean. Maybe that's why others don't want to play with me? Hmmmm.A fun app that lets you chose whether your black or white (if you chose white you have to play upside down) and offers a doubling dice."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire and I love it. The graphics are great plus you have options for difficulty, number of rounds in a match and it keeps track of your stats as well.  It also can show you possible moves if you are a beginner.  The game pieces are large enough that it's easy to see and use. Nicely done! As usual with free aps, there is advertisement but it is totally off to one corner and does not interfere with game play. Once in a while there is an offer to download one of their other games, but it is rare and again not a problem."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I found only two backgammon games in the Amazon app search, and the reason why is that the folks  @ AI Factory have written a solid game for those of us that remember the reason for these once popular games before FPS and D&amp;D. Real staticical stradederies. (as Geo. Bush would say). The game lets you concentrate on why certain moves are better than others and undo when you go astray and the algorithm smacks you down.On the next update I would and a line that says &quot;Not resigning&quot; when the game score is tied and the next game decides the match, even though its looking bad!  ie, a continue play button for fun's sake.  Compact app, plays great on my Kindle Fire.  MLawson di Ransom Canyon Rock Solid Consulting."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Like any other Backgammon app, this one increases the difficulty by tweaking the rolls to favor the computer. But it has some nice features for beginners.  You can take your move back even if the computer has already moved. It shows you which pieces are available to move, and where they can move, if you want it to. You can choose single games or matches with or without doubling.You can play against other people if you want to. For advanced players, this would be a convenient way to do that, but advanced players will not be challenged by the solo play. I'm advanced-beginner level and win most games at the highest level."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The game itself is a little to easy.It's a quick easy time killer for when you don't have alot of time to kill, but you don't want to stare at the walls for 5 or 10 minutes.

{"label": 1, "raw": "If you enjoy playing Backgammon, I recommend downloading this one, it can keep you entertained for hours on end.  I particularly like being able to choose the difficulty levels.  I don't really understand the &#34;doubling&#34; option that pops up from time to time, but you can turn that part off and not be bothered with it.  The computer is a good opponent even though some of its' moves don't always seem logical, it does give you a run for your money so to speak, and it plays fair.  The only improvement I would make on this game is to also offer the option of playing Acey-Duecy, but for the time-being I'm content with Backgammon."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This review is for the free version.  Very nicely done implementation of backgammon, with fast and elegant interface, nice user controls, and good documentation.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the computer opponent seems to follow a flawed strategy with its end game in that it doesn't try to get its pieces off the board as soon as possible.  Also it seems slow to double when the game is winning and quick to accept doubles when I'm winning.  All in all, it's just challenging enough for me to make it interesting at level 5.As for the random dice generator, I don't agree that the computer cheats, but it doesn't seem to have a true uniform distribution (where each of the six sides of each die is equally likely).  In one of my first dozen games it gave me the same roll three turns in a row, and it does seem to roll an awful lot of doubles."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The AI has some serious strategy problems.  In the last game I played, it had all its remaining pieced on 1 and 2, and rolled double ones.  It should have removed 4 from the board, but instead moved 4 from the 2 position, to the 1 position.  Stupid.  Making up for this deficiency, the computer gets better rolls.  It doesn't get more doubles, but it gets higher totals, and usually gets exactly what it needs.  Still fun, but still flawed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Backgammon is all about doubling and probable rolls of the dice...This is fast and great play.  A well designed app on my KFire.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm thrilled to have a backgammon game to play that requires no human partner. Aside from the fact that I don't even know anyone who wants to play the game, the invisible computer is way faster than a human. And, the AI opponent doesn't get its circuits in a bunch if you put them on the bar repeatedly. The moves available light up, and that sure makes things easy on the eyes. Since I haven't played in a while, this is a great way to get reacquainted with the game and start working my way up the difficulty levels. Lots of fun to play for 5 minutes or an hour!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is the world's all time leading cheater.  I have been playing backgammon for over 60yrs,  more than 1,000,000 games at least.  Statistics show that if you leave a spire open this app will hit you 90 / percent of the time. If you play this game as much as I do you know the statistical average is around  35 percent.  And wait until you get to a roll off,  count on the machine getting 3-4 doubles. They even have a disclaimer telling you why they are not cheating. This game is no fun.Grampyz"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like the Backgammon app, but there are a few things that are quite annoying.  For example, when you roll doubles, you have no option to move two pieces at a time.  You have to make 4 separate moves, with each move involving at least 2 clicks.  that's 8 clicks for one move, which is too many.  Also, I started playing against the computer, with the difficulty set at 2.  Even though it's not the lowest setting, the computer played like a complete novice, passing up obvious moves in favor of idiotic ones.  Of course, this can be solved by simply setting the game at a higher difficulty, but it was still annoying.  I'll be looking for fixes in updates, so I haven't given up hope that this could become an outstanding app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I played Colossal Cave (a.k.a. \"Adventure\") when it was first developed, back in the 1970s.  At the time, it was one of the most fascinating computer games available.  And its long life -- and the fact that I'm playing it again almost 40 years later -- support the fact that this is the greatest adventure game of all time.  There is a fascination with something that at first appears so simple, yet without \"awesome graphics\" or \"3-D whiz bangs\" or any other \"modern gaming devices\", and is still challenging and enjoyable.The game is implemented well, and I highly recommend it -- especially to younger players (by which I include anyone under about 35!) -- as a wonderful break from the fast and furious trigger-finger mindless destruction games that are so prevalent today."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Don't get me wrong. This is a good game for those that completely love text based games. My problem is that the plot is so vague, it gets aggravating at time. Collect Treasure. That would be nice and all if I didn't get lost in the forest all the time. I know that it adds to the challenge but if and when I do want to leave, I get even more lost. Your &quot;guide&quot; needs a larger vocabulary because the words I am forced time and time again to use are so simple, I literally drop my Kindle Fire and stomp away in anger."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As far as text adventures go - this is pretty frustrating. If it's complicated puzzles don't get you, the random holes that seem to appear in dark areas will. Or better yet, try getting out of the labyrinth while keeping your sanity. Maybe you should take the game's advice - or wait, don't because usually it doesn't work. What's worse is that it actually retorts when you finally tell it to **** off. Strange, difficult, and taunts the player. Decide for yourself if its your thing or not."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is for those who are old enough to remember playing Colossal Cave Adventure (ADVENT) way back in the old days.  These days, graphics in games are the norm.  If you want an experience that's different than all the third-person shooters, then try this out.  It's very basic with its vocabulary, but if you can manage to get into it, it's a very enjoyable and very vivid adventure because the graphics are all in your head.  It's one of the best relics of interactive fiction.  Infocom games started out soon after this and are very similar.  It's a lot like Zork I, but a little different."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "If this app were free, I'd probably give it 3, maybe 4 stars if it supported Android 3.0.  For $3?  It's lucky to get even 1.They seem to have left out a number of places, like IHOP (they have Denny's, though), Taco Johns, Papa Murphy's and Golden Corral (though they have Old Country Buffet).It also just displays nutritional info, but it lacks the ability to put together a whole meal and get a total of all those numbers.There are free apps that do a much better job of calorie counting than this one."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This dev can do much better - check the features for the iPhone version. I concur with the critical reviews this has been getting.  This has a decent # of restaurants and the ability to sort by various fields (calories, etc.), but definitely needs way more. It doesn't actually count anything; you can't change menu items to subtract items like mayo(which many websites do); there's no real size selection; it is missing key details like saturated fat, sodium, & sugar; other reviews have noted inaccuracies & that it is out of date on some items; needs app 2 sd card; it should also have a \"favorites\" option for restaurants & menu items for quick look-up. Clearly an app like this is much-needed, but this doesn't fill the void. Other reviewers suggested My Fitness Pal, Calorie Counter & MyNetDiary apps; I'm going to check them out."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was hoping for more to come of this app as the idea of an app that can help you add up the caloric intake is a great idea, but this app could use some extra work.  I'm glad I picked this up for free and didn't pay the $2 for it.  I'll still keep it, and probably refer to it, but the interface is not all that great to work around and I really wish it would allow you to look at several food items at once so you can see everything.I do appreciate that it is more than calories, knowing how much fat, protein, carbs, and fiber is also useful.I hope they update this app, I would like to see it become more than it is."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I expected a lot more. Not sure if thats because other calorie counting apps have set the bar so high, or because this one is just that bad. The list of restaurants is extremely short. The app doesn't look like anything special, considering the dev's want money for it. It lacks so many features, features that every other app of this category have. There should be some sense of customizing meals. Even if they didn't go above and beyond, selecting 1 standard size for each item is ridiculous. Some of these fast food sites even let you build your meal and see the totals. Honestly, this is a poor excuse for a calorie counting app. Don't waste your time.Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Everyone else is right - this app is pretty bad. Almost every single one of these restaurants already has this information on their web sites, and most of those allow you to build a meal so that you can actually COUNT calories.This app is also sorely lacking in food and restaurants. The Arby's Angus Three Cheese and Bacon is missing, and I've been seeing commercials for that for several weeks now. Plus the restaurant Zaxby's isn't listed at all.Honestly this would be tolerable were this a free app, it really wouldn't be worth. 99, but frankly for the dev to charge 3 bucks for this is just downright insulting."}

(KFire)  I also dislike that extra 5 of a kind cannot be counted as a score for a full house.iI give it 2 stars because the actual gameplay is pretty quick.Going to uninstall to see if I can't find one I like better,  or at least one that doesn't have gameplay functions literally on top of ad links.

I like the features of being able to move an item places in case you tap the wrong field.  The color change in the options is nice but it will sometime revert back to the original color then change to the color scheme you selected.Overall it's a fun app if you like playing Yahtzee."}

I love the musical tones when you \"hold\" a die and I love the sound when you \"roll\" the dice. The ability to change the colors of the game just adds to its appeal for me. I'm rocking my own little pink game of yahtzee AS I TYPE THIS. Then I'm going to head over and buy the paid version."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "first I would like to thank all my friends at amazon for the well wishes on a speedy recovery. I couldn't do it without you. today I left the hospital and on my way home I downloaded the faotd because it looked interesting. well im glad I did. when I got to the garage at me apartment I realized that about 1000 people must have moved im and all their cars were everywhere. so I grabbed my phone and started practicing after about level 14 I realized what I needed to do to get my car in a spot. thanks amazon I just wish everybody in my apartment building had this to so we could keep the garage organized."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I know the description says \"not compatible with Droid\", but one reviewer said it ran fine on his Droid Bionic, so I figured I'd try.  Big mistake - the app ran really slow, then even slower, then hung the phone completely. The only recourse at that point was too pull the battery and restart.  Some may think one star is unfair, given that the app is merely (not) performing as advertised, but there's really no excuse for this kind of behavior on one of the most popular Android platforms."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a very fun way to waist (spend) time. As far as all the worry about datamining? If your playing on a Kindle Fire, as I am what data can they get? Also if your worried just disable Internet access before starting the game.  Believe me, it is well worth any small effort just to play this game.  To all you yelling about this being a copy of other games like Blockme,,, almost every game is a copy of the one that came before it.  It's called innovation or improvement.  Paranoia is sometimes a good thing but this is just a game and an easy workaround for any phone users.  I would readily put this as one of the most brain teasing and fun games on Amazon.  jmho"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Reading some of the lame negative reviews on \"free app\" day, I almost didn't d'load it. I'm glad I gave it a try anyway. Can't figure out why anyone would rank this low, unless it just didn't work on their tablet or phone. Works great on Kindle Fire. Sort of difficult to put down, once I start playing the puzzles. Both in our family have enjoyed it already. I think this game is better on a tablet than paying 20 bucks for the plastic pieces and game cards for the board game."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Well, I played 40+ puzzles, I guess it can't be bad. You might almost call it addicting. :-) It is a decent puzzle game, but somehow it feels a bit overdone. Can a game be too flashy or frilly?Regardless, this game will keep you occupied. I haven't played any of the other traffic puzzle games to give an accurate comparison. But, if you like puzzles or puzzle games you won't be disappointed getting this one as Free App of the Day. Whether it's worth paying for compared to the free alternatives, I can't say."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This program consists of about six single-screen puzzles, each with a few variations.  After about 10 minutes of play they begin to repeat.  As you move through the games there is no escalation in difficulty or any apparent attempt to select the \"next\" puzzle based on previous puzzles or the child's success at solving them.In our case my 4-year old daughter got bored even before the first sequence was completed.  A little ways after the puzzles began to repeat she closed the app and wanted to watch a movie.On the plus side, this app is \"solid\" (no bugs and with a finished appearance).  It also does *not* need any kind of Internet connection to run.  (Some reviewers said it did and I expect they may have been using an earlier version.)  Finally, it runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.In summary, it is good for at least one fairly short sitting."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Good: My 3 year old loves it.  It was fun, interactive, and she got the concept quickly.  Graphics are cool, as are the sticker rewards.Bad: It does get repetitive at times, so a few more challenges or variety would be nice.  Also, it turns off your screen saver as well as your ability to exit the app, so the only way to stop it is to turn off the phone, turn the phone back on, and then kill it, so it's murder on your battery life."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this app when it was free, but it is definitely worth the $2 asking price. Interface is pretty solid, colors are bright, voices are annoying; all the things that hold a child's attention. I feel this does a good job of teaching simple shapes, colors, and counting.Basically this is a collection of mini games for your little one. Every few mini games, it rewards you with a sticker, which you paste on a wall and immediately go back to mini games. Shape puzzles are smooth and easy for my three year old, counting is maybe a little automated as it doesn't encourage you to follow along as it counts when you tap the fruits. It is educational until your little angel can count to 20 on his or her own, but even then it's entertaining and anything that buys me an extra ten minutes of peace at the grocery store check-out is worth two bucks!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Out of all the things I have put on my Kindle this is by far the best.  A fellow teacher had her son and mother-in-law with her at school one day.  My grandson is the same age as her son.  We were talking about apps and games for our three-year-olds.  Her mother-in-law recommended this game.  I got it for my grandsons (both age 3) to play when visiting. After my son saw it he purchased it for his son.  It is educational, fun and they learn to play it as they go.  This should be a must on every tablet, computer or other device if you have preschoolers."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "One of my grandkids is a big Curious George fan so I had to give this game a try and cannot help but compare to theJumpstart Preschool 1 Free - Preschool Educational Appgames.  What I like about these games are that they help with counting skills and matching games that the Jumpstart games do not provide.  In addition, the puzzle game in Monkey Preschool is much easier to pick up; in the Jumpstart puzzle game you are allowed to pile puzzle pieces on top of each other and on top of the pattern so that key clues are covered.  With the Monkey Preschool, the pieces snap back to the pickup pile and do not become piled up so all the pieces are out in the open and easy to compare with the pattern.  Although the Jumpstart games are a lot of fun, the Monkey Preschool games have an overall edge in ease of learning the concepts and in the breadth of skills."}

It is real too, I was sitting in my bean bag chair and I had it on, my little sister had spilled chips on the floor, the ghost radar said robot, which freaked me out because we have an electronic robot that cleans, and it was on. It also said stepped, and as I was going to tell my mom, I stepped in the chips! Another experience I had, I was on the couch, and my mom said to my baby sister, oh I need to change you!

I continued down the stairs to get my ferret. her name is snickers.

I had just gotten out of the shower, talking to my husband, naked I might add, and the word \"Beautiful\" came up. Now I could flatter myself and think it was talking about me but I just brushed it off then I had to give my husband Insulin, 2 shots which he doesn't like very well and was grumbly about it, when I was through I looked at my Kindle and another word popped up, \"Necessary\" Coincidence?

And sometimes it'll say random things like 'kite' and 'child' when neither of those things are around. so I'm skeptical as to whether or not this is real or for just entertainment purposes...nonetheless, it's creepy when it's accurate."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "Whether or not you believe, this app will DEFINITELY make you question the possibilities! Eerily relevant responses from &quot;the unseen realm&quot;! Seriously, though, I bought this as a lark, expecting very little. However, within minutes of starting the radar, I was quite unnerved by some of the words coming through.Also, I know plenty of Kindle Fire users are complaining about not having a microphone to pick up voices, but I find that to be a benefit, as the app can't confuse random surrounding sounds as possible voices. O simply explain out loud that any entity that wishes to communicate can simply use the Kindle to speak to me. I have had very impressive sessions with different people, and different locations, each situation having different interactions, and outcomes.Just give it a fair try, and I promise you shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "While I have yet to get an answer to a question it does give you responses and some of them are the oddest words. The word bank must be huge.

I have had both on together but not picked up the same thing in the same place or gotten the same word on both in fact I have not heard the same word twice on one device or any of the three together (wife's android). So i feel that a random generator/selector is not part of the program since most of those things &#34;pick&#34;  the same word from time to time. just try it what can it hurt?!?"}

It had red, green, yellow, and strange blue dots all over the screen. It was awesome. I really recommend this app. It is lots of fun and I am glad I got it :)Note: Review is from my daughter.  Thus far it seems to do really well, saying \"Father\" when I am in the room, and saying, \"metal\" when her Mom is in the room.  Her Mom had a metal rod in her leg when she was younger and it still messes up antennae TV signals when she is near them.  Thus this is a more interesting version then older ones I have been exposed to &lt;--This last part is me."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this app for 2 reasons: it was free, and it looked cool. But it got annoying. All it was, really, was a green radar that showed little dots every so often. I quickly got bored with it and deleted it. Afterwards, I was persuaded to actually BUYING the other version of Ghost Radar, which was supposedly &quot;better.&quot; Sure, it was a little cooler. You could go back and forth from the classic radar and an activity waves line graph. It also &quot;translated the ghosts messages to you,&quot; which I actually believed for a while. But don't believe a word of it, people. The radar does not &quot;sense&quot; anything. If you want an app that you can just use for fun, go ahead. But it does NOT sense ghosts.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I have used this app for over a year.  It has entertained me, my kids, my friends, my wife, my co-workers and so on.  I am a believer in ghosts, but a severe skeptic of this app.  Every now and then it'll creep you out by spouting relevant words and dots in relevant locations, but at least 75% of it appears to be random or void of energy spikes.  Anyone who takes this app too seriously is gullible and anyone who dismisses it completely is joyless.  It delivers fun and entertainment to believers and skeptics alike and should be used solely for entertainment."}

Here's what it did to me one time: I was on my kindle fire on the couch, and it said &quot;wind&quot;. I thought it meant something, so I went to the weather channel. Believe it or not, but there was a big tornado watch in the south, thank goodness I don't live down there. I'm never trying in my bedroom, though. I'm afraid. I admit it. But this app is real.

{"label": 1, "raw": "You know why you can't get it on Kindle Fire? It doesn't have a camera, and all devices you can download on do. It utilizes the camera without you knowing, and it identifies the object and says the word. This explains why it needs so much information- it wires to the camera. I didn't realize this until I read you couldn't get it on the fire and it uses a lot of info. If you don't beleive me, you don't, but an app can't utilize 1,000-5,000 dollar equipment."}

I allowed him to try and speak with her,  a red dot appeared and the word Giant and My was said.  too many on point coincidences for me.  I say it is worth the download if you are curious.

{"label": 1, "raw": "At first I was skeptical of this app, but right when I started it the app said \"chair\"...I was laying in bed with my desk chair facing me and the phone. So i kinda thought it somehow used the phone's camera, I was at the store and it said shelf and then I got shivers and it said breeze. But the big selling point was when I was in my room changing and the app said change...the phone was on my bed with the camera facing the sheets so it wasn't the camera.I don't know if its 100% accurate or real but its probably 75% entertaining and 25% real. Kinda like a ouija board thats sold as a game but then theres creepy stories about it.But its fun when it talks, usually a lot of silence."}

I wound up in a number of pieces. It can be quite challenging to keep track of all of them. This application does an adequate job of finding the big pieces like my legs but isn't sensitive enough for my fingers and nose. Since the little pieces are the ones that usually get lost, this is a serious drawback."}

I thought about ice cream just to mess with the train of thoughts, and it gave back DAIRY,  followed by COLD afterwards.Then it hit me. I am a ghost.It took some remembering, but i died years back in a car accident, and i had been in denial this whole time.Thanks to this app, i was able to realize that i had passed on, and finally cross over. well. not yet. i am writing this before i finally rest. :)"}

No, I didn't think so."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Sometimes the words it gives you are creepier than playing on a ouija board. For instance: it said my dad's name. I haven't had contact with him in about 5 years. That night I see that he found me on Facebook and sent me a (20 days late) birthday message. I can't decide if I believe in the astronomical odds against that coincidence, or if there was something supernatural about it.If you don't believe in the ghost thing at all, I still say download it. You will probably have fun with it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Okay, this is a perfect app for Halloween! My little nieces and nephew will get a kick out of it. Wanna know why? Because anyone thinking that a 99 cent app with actually detect real ghosts is insane. This is a funny little app that I rank right up there with the Magic 8 Ball. A cool bit of fun for the holiday.Those of you who are whining that it doesn't work for &quot;real ghosts&quot;? Stop it. Either call those ghost dudes on tv, or better yet use that money for therapy. You're welcome."}

My uncle is a professional ghost hunter who removes ghosts. He normally uses seventy thousand dollar worth of equipment, including a quantum flux integrator which he designed himself, he says this app is better than all of his equipment, and makes his fancy stuff obsolete. My uncle says if you have ghosts, you should call him, he will remove the ghosts for a small fee. Mom says he's a charlatan. I don't know what that word means but I'm sure it's something nice."}

Just seemed to get some things right with the words it spoke.1st incident:  Was in the bathroom stinking up the place (#2) and then the app said, &quot;sell, memory, row&quot;.  I laughed at it and kept going.  When flushing, the toilet clogged up and I had a minor flood in the bathroom.  Its nothing large enough to &quot;row&quot; in, but I thought I would &quot;sell&quot; yall my &quot;memory&quot;....hahahaha.2nd incident:  Was in my room when it said &quot;useful, cutting&quot;.  So, I decided to investigate the house to see whats up.  Weird thing I found, my mother was clipping coupons.

{"label": 1, "raw": "The title says it all. The reason I didn't give it a better score was not because of what it is or what is was supposed to be or do. It was just for fun.  It was because of the way it worked. It used way to much system resources and was nearly impossible to turn off. On more than one occasion I had thought I had turned it off only to find it still running in the background. I couldn't find any setting to shut it off on exit. I had to use the app killer installed in order to close it. Quite annoying."}

If you use it where there's nothing there, you get random words, but if you use it in the right place it's great ! Just give it about a 1/2 hour to adjust to the envirorment before you take it seriously. I also like the radar so you can see any energy that is around. We assume these are equal to the orbs we get on video. It also keeps a history of \"words spoken\" so you don't even have to be with it. You can review them later. It will run 3 to 4 hrs. which is plenty of time for an investigation. LOVE IT !!!"}

I haven't figured out the advanced options yet but the \"Info\" and \"FAQ\" are better than most. It's straightforward and tells you that it \"does NOT detect EMF nor gravity\".Just in time for Halloween... I think the kids will enjoy this the most.

I walked out into the hallway where one of my cats was sitting and suddenly the radar said \"feed\". Yes indeed the cat was waiting for me to feed him.Most of the time it says things that don't make much sense but I get a kick out of it just the same. Yes, I am easily amused. :)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is a fraud. It was unable to detect a known ghost living in my home for several decades.Back in the early 60s, a middle aged man was murdered in my home by a home intruder. This man's spirit has yet to leave the physical world for the spiritual as his murder has never been solved. He REFUSES to leave. This has been validated by several ghost hunting experts and I often hear him moaning about being hungry or tired.I tried using this app to detect his location but it wouldn't work. In fact, I knew he was in the bathroom at one point playing with the cat, but the app told me there was a \"reading\" in the kitchen.So, to sum it up, for those looking for something cheap to help them detect the ghosts living around us, look elsewhere.This app makes a mockery of the dead and the developers should be ashamed."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this as the free app of the day from Amazon today.  I am glad I didn't pay any real money for this as this is like a \"Rick Roll\" type app which doesn't really do anything productive.  It was obviously meant to promote Sean Austin's music career.This app would be useful to people who want ideas to start their own music careers by picking a strange catchy name for your developer name and disguising it as something else such as a party gag type app.I agree with the many other reviewers that the reviews for this app are rather funny and entertaining.  Therefore, I am giving it 2 stars just because it gets people wanting to discuss their app purchases on Amazon."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app gives you a string of letters and about 30 seconds to make as many words as you can.  Then it moves on to another string of letters.  I find some sets easy, and others challenging, but I have always been able to think of at least one word for any set.  Even with the easy sets, I have to think fast to get a three-letter word, four-letter word, and so on, before it changes sets.It's great for when I'm not sure how much time I'll have to play because I can quit a game any time.  This is a must-have app for Wordies.  No problems loading on mySamsung Galaxy Tab, it doesn't hang up, and there are no intrusive ads."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "While the name suggests a simple application, the dev did (is doing?)  a good job. Very configurable, with different lines and coin requirements, and multiple near complete themes. I say near complete because there is only one set of sounds. The dev may be intending to add more as there is a custom theme option which allows you mix and match machines, symbols, and sounds.The graphics are done pretty old for the machine, symbols done much better. The game runs very stable and smoothly."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Gave it a high rating as it's free and does more than i thought it would for free. Alot of free app's are just that free, you open and u can't use most of the features cause thay want a fee to do so. This one is simple to use and move around in. Streaming live TV, news vid's, news articles, my stocks watch list, and alot more. Sometimes with a weaker connection u can't load vids or watch live TV. but everything else loads well on weak signals. I recommend this app to all."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a great app and it's FREE. Not only did it make finding a good wi-fi  connection for my Fire easy, but it also helped me improve my wireless signal for my pc. Easy to use and - Thanks to the developers for not shoving any BUY THIS - DO THAT at me. I understand the need to make some income from your work, that's only fair,. So if you need the cash so badly, please don't offer it for free.Easy to use and does just what it says."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "What can I say other than it works like a charm! Open it up and, if you have the graph selected, you can see all the wireless signals in the area, centered on its channel, and the height of the peak corresponds to signal strength. Walk around the house to see how the signal strength changes. Surprisingly, there were several more signals - about 3X as many than shown on my phone or laptop - picked up by this app.  I installed a wireless extender and was able to optimize its location using Wireless Analyzer. There's a lot more it can do, but this alone has me sold!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I read the issues of freezing and people downloading it, and then having to remove it for different reasons. I give an app of this type time to see what it can do for finding those access points known as hot spots. I can follow the readings ok, but I too wish it had a free adds version available. Maybe that was going to be for this offering of an WiFi analyzer from this company. Test and use over time will tell, if this app is worth keeping on the Kindle Fire HD Tablet. I will give it a try, and I will keep searching for others to have a possible back up of the same type app available for my Kindle Fire HD. I think the multitude of resources like the guide books and manuals help one know what is true or works true to use."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this app onto my Kindle Fire, started it up and it immediately displayed the closest wireless networks to me and I was able to identify the most congested channels around. I logged into my wireless router and switched to an unused channel and my Kindle Fire connectivity improved tremendously. My Roku connection which was listed as \"poor\" also shot up immediately to \"excellent\". Now my connections just fly and my wireless router no longer drops every few days the way it had been. I also walked through the house and discovered even more networks near to me that had been impacting my bandwidth. This is an excellent application and I wholeheartedly recommend it. You don't have to be a geek to use the app, btw. It's simple to use as it offers multiple graphical views which in turn makes it easy to understand the information displayed."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Great for looking around at Wifi networks, their security levels, channels, strength.Great for walking around your home and determining who's nearby home is interfering with your network, and on what channel you can best set your router.Great for finding dead zones at work, or anywhere.With the optional Connector Library, you can click on a net and connect.There are many tools like this, surely, but this one's simplicity and ease of use (we call that \"usability\" in the biz) put it ahead of the rest."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is reason enough to get an Android device.  The information it provides regarding channel usage on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands is essential if you want to set up devices and wifi routers for the best possible performance.  Sure, you can get fancier products from Fluke and others, but if you go that route you'll pay hundreds of dollars and have more junk to tote around.For most Android apps there are several functional alternatives.  Wifi Analyzer stands alone.The associated Wifi Connector Library is useful if you want one-click sign-ons to different networks."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Another (Must have) for Kindle Fire users. This one has like 5 setting to check out  just about all you need on your wi-fi.. One has a meter thats great to see where are all the Hot Spots at around the house.. You can even add a beep to it do drive everyone nuts!, beep!!!  beep!, lol. Fallow my \"review list\" here on amazine to find out whats the Best that other Kindle Fire users are useing. Thats all I put on my list.. Nothing but the best for you.. Enjoy all."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've long hunted for an app that gives me the kind of WiFi signal strength and access point info for my home networks in a format that is easily understood, and WiFi Analyzer takes the cake. Using this app I was able to configure the twelve networks we have here in our college housing apartment complex so they don't conflict with each other, so they have the best signal strength possible, and much more. Everyone here who uses our WiFi saw a huge improvement, and it was thanks to this app. And it's free. You really can't beat that. Five stars."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this app to troubleshoot problems I was having in my wi-fi network with some people being unable to see my access point's SSID advertisements. Within a few minutes this app gave me enough information to solve my problems!The two most useful parts of the display were the channel spread per access point, and the signal strength. The channel spread showed me that I'd picked the same channel for my wireless network (11) as my neighbors, which was causing conflicts. I moved to channel 3 and there was no longer spectrum overlap. Also, another display showed the DB strength of my wireless signal, which made me realize that the placement of my router is less than optional. Not bad for 10 minutes with an app I used with a wireless deployment I've had for months.If you're experienced with wi-fi, this is a useful diagnostic tool. If you're NOT experienced with wi-fi, this might still show you some interesting info. I recommend it!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I give it 3 rather than 5 stars because it does work very well, however the installation process is not straight forward if you need to set it up using a web browser rather than pushing a WPS button on your router. In Method 2 &#62;&#62; Setup via Web Browser in Step 3 you are directed to a web site to complete the process. That web site is for sale. The Tech Support number takes you to China and while they were helpful in getting me set up, they are more demanding and fast paced than I prefer.If your router has a WPS button to connect devices to your network this is a good device at a good price."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "When you move, your Wi-Fi modem just might be having problems because everyone in your neighborhood is on the same channel.  WiFi Modems use channels like Walkie Talkies, and when there are too many on the same channel, your WiFi Devices have a hard time reaching your modem.  This little gem will tell you who is on what channel, and what channels are not being used so that you or your internet provider can change the channel to one that is not being used, and you can enjoy delay free streaming!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is the best wifi detector i have seen.  It gives you a very good picture of the signals around you.  You can place your wifi on the channel that is used the least to avoid interference.  Just walking around the room with this thing is pretty interesting.  Driving down the road with it is even more fun.  I'm not sure how the other functions are used but the spectrum display is all anyone would need.  The screen gets really crowded in town.  The only improvement I could see would be to have the option to highlight the open systems so that you can pick them out of the crowd."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Works like a charm on Kindle Fire!. It was very helpful in positioning the Router. I was amazed how much difference it made with the Wi-Fi signal after re-positioning the router just few feet higher of it's original place. I love the different visual options and audio beeps from the app that makes your work easy to read the signal strength and also different recommendations as to which channel is less crowded in your area.I can see it very useful for anyone who roams a lot with their kindles and want to find the best Wi-Fi in the locality.Super useful. Now ... I wish it could also detect leaking pipes around the house :-)Five Stars! Kudos to the Developer and making this app FREE!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Great free app.This one is a must for any Kindle Fire user.Helps you know which wifi network signals are around, how strong/weak your signal is and what is the cleanest/less busy wifi channel available in your home area so you can get better connection and less interference from your crazy neighbors.Note: You have to change the wifi channel in your wifi routers settings not on the app. You do this by accessing the settings UI with your web browser (usually 192.168.1.1 or something like that). Once you find the best channel (during peak hours in the evening, set your channel to the one least used and you will be happy)Helps when out on the town as well trying to decide which public wifi signal to tap into.Enjoy and be sure to tell others of this great app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a handy little utility for detecting Wi Fi sources in your vicinity. Within moments, you can see what other users are online in your area and what channels they are using, for both 2.4 and 5 GB. If you live or work in a crowded environment with lots of sources, you can more readily select a channel that will minimize interference. The information is available in a number of formats.Obviously, a utility like this doesn't do much, but it uses very little memory and is easy to use, so it' good to keep it on your device until you need it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a good app to analyze the wi-fi signals around you...and if you live in a suburb there will be many.  Just about everyone now has a wi-fi router in their home.  This app identifies every signal within range and can graph their strength.  This is good as you can walk around your house/ airport/ coffee shop/ whatever and find the areas with strong signals/weak signals.  The best part is the real-time graph which clocks signal strength over time.  You can even do a screen shot and send it via e-mail."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is the first wi-fi analyzer I downloaded, but being curious, I downloaded a few more, but this is the best of the bunch. It has the most features and the easiest to understand features. I even paid for one of the other ones that I downloaded because it had pretty pictures, and it was the most worthless. This wi-fi analyzer is now my most useful app. It continues to amaze me how wildly a signal will vary, especially if it is a so-so signal to begin with."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is perfect for those times when you're totally stumped on a crossword.  You enter the letters you have and question marks for the blanks, and it will give you a list of possible words.  Clicking on a word will show the definition.  Doesn't work for proper names, unfortunately, nor does it work if the answer is multiple words (e.g. \"peanutbutter\").  May return a huge list of words if you have too many blanks.No ads!  Huzzah!Works great on both the Evo and the Xoom."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a nice little game - and excellent value for free paid app of the day. Works very well on the Kindle Free.You need to operate switches to get blobs of differently-colored fire to a color-matched home. The speed control is a very nice feature. You can take it on the slow side and it can be quite relaxing. I can only guess at how hectic it would be a full speed! You can adjust the volume for the music and the sound effects. Incidentally, the music and sound effects are fine and not annoying.This is a very solid 4-star plus game; however, I went up to 5 stars to counter some of the earlier negative reviews, which I felt were not justified."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really enjoyed this game. It was nice to be able to slow down the fireballs for certain levels so I could keep track. Even on the slowest setting some of the levels could still be pretty challenging at first. I played this on Kindle Fire. Probably would be harder on a small phone.Only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is that there aren't enough levels. I finished the whole thing in a couple of hours. I also wish there was some bonus for finishing every level with a perfect score."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've used SplashId for several years on Palm, Windows Mobile and Windows desktop. It has been easy to use. Synchronizing between platforms has been good but not perfect. Version 6 wireless synchronous works very well, better than previous versions.The interface in this version takes some time to learn but is pretty good. After using version 4 for a few years, I've had difficulty finding some functions and features but no serious issues.The big problem with this version is that the App locks every time I switch to another App. I open SplashID Safe,  enter the password, get a password for a web site, switch to the browser and then return to SplashID only to find I must enter the password again even if only a few seconds passed since I entered it.SplashData tech support says the lockout delay was removed for security reasons. They are working on a solution to add the lockout delay back into the App. The Aneroid App is practically useless to me if this defect is not corrected."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is an interesting calendar tool and astronomical guide to lunar activity.  On the main screen it shows you what the moon will be like today.  You have to enter in your location to get accurate information.  What I like is that by touching the calendar symbol at the top you get a monthly calendar and it shows the lunar status for every day of the upcoming month.  You can even look months ahead.  If you touch a day the lower  of the screen provides a larger view of the moon on the day you selected.By touching the data button you can review all of the lunar activity for that day with all of the scientific data provided to you.  The place button wants you to enter you location to provide you accurate lunar data.  You also have a clock function in order to advance the data or time to see the changes in the view of the moon.I gave this app 5 stars for the quality of the data provided and its uniqueness. It is interesting!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This Is just something I downloaded for entertainment. However, I seem to have a curiosity on the phase of the moon. This program does that. It even has some other features such as a calendar to show what phase of Moon will be in on a particular day of the month.There are a few things that were a little rough around the edges. This program can be moved to the SD card. This is a very important feature, since most of my tablets are of the older variety and is good to make room on the main flash drive. The first time I ran this program on the card, it really didn't want to work. But that was the only time that it complained. It has fired up correctly since then. It does not show correctly what part of the moon is lit up, though the amount that seem to be correct.So, it is something to play around with, and doesn't take any space on the main memory."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "To address the one oft mentioned issue. The developer is now aware that it shows waning gibbous for today (1/8/12) and it only seems to affect today. He is working on a fix for it. If you're guess that means you get a quick reply from the Dev, you'd be absolutely correct.The app works beautifully on my Droid 2 Global and I had no issues with it freezing. However, I did use the back button to exit out and not the home button. Overall, between quick developer response and the very slick, nicely done app, can't help but give this little darling a 5 star. If you like having the phases of the moon at your fingertips, this is the app for you and with it being FAOTD? You can't lose. ;)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app is awesome. The graphics are so amazing, it's like you are at space camp looking at the moon through a telescope. You can see it with several different graphics settings too. It's so cool to turn the moon with my stylus or fingers, on my Kindle Fire HD, to view all sides of the moon. It even adjusts the date and time, when you spin it to accurately display the time your hemisphere will or did see the moon from that angle. There is also a calendar button so you can view the different moon phases for each day of the previous, current, and future month(s). Love it! And it's really only 70&cent; with the 30&cent; credit Amazon gives. Totally worth 70&cent; if you are into the moon or it's phases/cycles."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "l became interested in the moon as a child when my parents bought me a 60x Tasco telescope 50 years ago.  l still have that scope and now use it with my grandchildren.  This app brings back fond memories of the times l had with that old scope.  As nice as it looks on my Galaxy 3, the way it looks and runs on my new Kindle Fire HD is even better.  Be sure and switch to the dynamic imaging to get better pictures of the lunar surface.  The \"Cheese\" mode is kinda cute (albeit useless)as well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm not sure about all the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this game. The graphics are fine, but I've definitely been more impressed with visuals in other games (like Osmos HD or even Hex Defense). The backgrounds seem quite similar to the live wallpaper on my phone. Cool, but not &quot;wow&quot;!The game's instructions are vague in some respects, and the mumbling spirit could use a grammar proofreader (&quot;be awared!&quot;). After completing the first area, and some of the second, I honestly can't see the 5 stars people are giving this app. I mainly downloaded it because I was suspicious of the reviews."}

There is some &#34;background story&#34; -- though it does not affect the gameplay at all, and frankly is pretty mundane for the most part.  But anyone who likes a logic challenge should enjoy this game."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've read that because this is a HD version it cannot be played on the first or second generation kindle fires. It actually can. I own more than one HD game and its just as clear as any other game. Now as far as the game goes: it's alright nothing great but not horrible. It's basically a matching game that gets harder as you move along. Kills time but I've played better. And the totem that &quot;talks&quot; to you is neither creepy or cute is straight annoying."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Yeah it sure is simple in the very first few levels but it does get interesting after you complete some levels. The graphics are very good and cute. The Totem keeps mumbling something or the other in each level as you get acquainted with the rules of the game. You can skip the mumbling if you like. It installed fine on the original 'Kindle Fire' even-though it says \"HD\" and I am keeping this on my Kindle Fire and play few more levels and update the review later if needed. But for FAOTD I think it is a worth a try. If you are into puzzles and matching games you will like it.Have fun!"}

The brilliance in this is not in endlessly matching 2, 3 or more rows of identical items, it's the pattern in which you unlock them that is the key to wiping out the entire level.  The little floating guide persona is cute at first but gets kinda boring after a while.  There may be too much backstory wedged into what is in essence an easy to learn but harder to master puzzle.Besides being a thoughtful time waster, the graphics and animations are all buttery smooth and game play is perfectly responsive.  A great effort!"}

Being able to sync the day's goings on with the baby is so helpful, especially if you have one working parent and one stay at home parent or care giver or a child on medication daily that needs to be tracked. I would love to see this app used in a childcare facility. Being able to instantly see what's logged is great to keep everyone feeling like they're involved in baby's day even when they're at work. Granted I haven't used it in months, but the Dev was responsive and even considers user recommendations! Must have for new parents!"}

It keeps saying 'authentication failed' whenever we try to add a Twitter account.I've kept the app hanging around on this tablet hoping that they would correct the problem in an update, but apparently that won't be happening -- perhaps because Seesmic is now owned by HootSuite, which has its own app it develops. That's unfortunate because Seesmic is the only Twitter client I know of that has a 'combined view' feature that merges our multiple accounts."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Tweetcaster has more features, but Seesmic was enough. I liked that Seesmic didn't ask for access to low level system log files (like Tweetcaster does) but disliked that it wanted my GPS data. Seesmic has a nice refresh button. It is hard to tell when something has been retweeted, and by whom. FB integration did not work for this Kindle Fire user, either. I would also have liked the ability to use a darker theme. I am keeping Seesmic and not Tweetcaster mostly for the data access issue."}

Secondly, allow user to move a card from the Aces area back to the tableau -- currently, I think once you stack a card onto one of the aces stacks, it won't let you move it back to the tableau.  These two features are absolutely critical when you need to backtrack in order to find the solution.  When these two issues are resolved, combined with the killer graphics, this will be the app of choice for playing FreeCell."}

The graphics, background music, and sound effects all blend well together into a spooky feel.  Controls are easy to work with and respond well.

Its a bit quirky and the storyline is a bit obtuse which leaves one with a very loose idea of where to look next in some areas.  In games like this the fun is all in the delivery, the story unfolding.  Unfortunately thats where this one falls short... and speaking of short.. if the delivery were better and the clues/solutions a bit more logical this game would take all of about 10 minutes to play though.  I wish I could give this a 5 star rating but even though it is entertaining and has a good atmosphere it just leaves you wishing for more. But the creators have my sincere appreciation and applause. I wish more gaming companies would work to supply the fans of this genre with hours and hours of entertaining deduction."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I purchased this for my Kindle Fire because I really enjoyed playing The Lost City, but this was a disappointment.  Although graphics quality is excellent, this is really, REALLY too short.  It took me maybe an hour to complete it. Also the last puzzle was really finicky (blue circles on basement door) and the lightest touch will cause it to reset so that even if you've solved it once, you're forced to do so again (and again). Also, the ending was lame - a real anticlimax.It was also pretty easy, but I don't mind this if there are a lot of visually interesting scenes or landscapes.  In this game the graphics were nice but again there were only around ten different settings."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded The lost city when it was free, and I loved it. (It wasn't too short, but I wouldn't of been dissapointed if it had been longer.) I read the reviews for The secret of Grisly manor, and seeing it was made by the same people as The lost city, I bought it for $0.99. I had read reviews, and some people said it was very short, and I figured it would be as long as the other one (Which took me about a week). I was very wrong..I could've finished it in half an hour.So I gave The secret of Grisly Manor 4 stars, because I was dissapointed in the length. (In my opinion. it should be free - it wasn't long enough to be worth even a dollar.)If you're going to purchase one, purchase The lost city - you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "'The Secret of Grisly Manor' is one of those room-escape style games where instead of breaking out, you're breaking in and exploring. The puzzles and item usage is pretty standard for a game like this.I wouldn't say that the game is too short like some of the other reviews here, but I would say that once you've beaten it the first time, there's no point in replaying it because there aren't any puzzles that will take you long to beat again or any game mechanics you'll forget and have fun relearning."}

They're challenging enough that you'll scratch your head for a bit, but won't be too difficult for the sake of being difficult.My main problem with this is that its too expensive. Almost 2 dollars for a game that you can beat in less than an hour? I've spent 4 dollars on other apps that have a gameplay of 20+ hours and its still going. Wish it was longer, or at least that they would make a free version with advertisement throughout the game."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game, at first seems interesting but quickly you realize that its too short and has no replay value. once you solve the game there is nothing else to do, so max 20 minutes of playing. don't waste your money. spend that dollar somewhere else. got it for free and even that sounds like too much for this game, waste of space on my phone. if any new levels are created they're probably going to charge for them.

{"label": 1, "raw": "First, have to mention that if any of you have played the Nancy Drew games they will understand how much easier this is to play.Based a bit on those mysteries, but not with the complex moving around rooms to investigate, the action and finding of clues is entertaining enough and for the price, quite good.  The fact that it was short, played in less than two hours with a granddaughter, by candlelight and flashlight (power outage)  and the ending was a 'cop-out&#34;, caused me to be disappointed.However, I am sure that children and preteens will enjoy it, so based on age I think it will work fine for some.  Being a 79 year oldGreat Granny (who has played mysteries with grandchildren) might not make me the right person to review this adequately, for those of younger ages.  I guess what I am saying, is the challenge is there for the much younger generations, though not necessarily for teenagers."}

If you get stuck, you're on your own OR you have to resort to the internet walkthrough. Not fun for me. Even with the help online, I quickly realized that I would never have figured some of the puzzles, clues and their use or finished this game. For me, maybe it's more like a 1-star, but I know this game has a cult following of obviously clever folks who are able to solve the clues and I want to encourage all game makers to give us Kindle people MORE!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I bought this after playing The Lost City, and perhaps I should have reversed that choice.  Unlike The Lost City, this game does not have the hint and map features, so it's up to you to figure out the clues and locate the puzzle pieces.  That being said, I finished the game in a few hours and wished there was more to it.  I agree that it could have been longer with more screens. Again, the graphics were nicely done, the puzzles fairly easy to solve, and it worked well on my Kindle Fire.This had a nice balance between clever and challenging clues.I probably would have been less disappointed if I had played this game first and followed it with The Lost City."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "The Secret of Grisly Manor is a nice little puzzle game in line with the other two FMG games I have, Adventures of Mosaika and The Lost City.  However, Grisly Manor seems more like a prototype rather than a fully formed game and features present in the subsequent games are sorely missed here.  The Journal is particular, which saves a great deal of time retracing the path back to previously-explored rooms to review clues to puzzles.  On the other hand, perhaps that was deliberate in order to artificially inflate the amount of time it takes to solve the game.  Because as short as Mosaika and Lost City are, Grisly is practically a blip.  The puzzle solutions in Grisly weren't as involved either, which is troubling as the other games are not exactly complex.  The Secret of Grisly Manor has atmosphere in its graphics and sound, but as a puzzle game, while acceptable, it doesn't compare to the rest of Fire Maple Games' offerings, even at 99 cents."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "A great point and click game. You have to go through a house and find clues and apply them. No annoying hidden objects. All the clues are reasonable and discoverable, and you have hints available too. I only wish the game were a bit longer.

I wish Fire Maple would make more games like this!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "So the game play is fun and amazing, but my issue is the fact that you only need to solve about 5 'puzzles' to finish the entire game... For $1 it's a pretty decent investment for those looking for a way to kill 30 to 60 minutes - or more if you want to drag it out.

{"label": 1, "raw": "This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone. The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?"}

My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception.

I finally discovered that pushing the back &#34;button&#34; twice quickly on my device  I could get to my music.

{"label": 1, "raw": "It's not all that sophisticated of an App, but it serves the purpose.  But it works great for me because I use several phones (one for each region I frequently travel to) and it's nice to have my music with me whenever I want to play them.  Best part of it is I don't have to load down the already limited memory of my phones with the entire library.  I can just stream the playlist (or artist, album, etc.) that I want to listen to."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I use my Kindle Fire at home to listen to music. Now I just grab my phone and get in the car and hook up with the blue tooth and have all my music with me. It's the same simple format as the Kindle and I can play right out of the cloud without having any music on my phone and all. I read all the reviews complaining about the app size. And I'm surprised that people so tech savvy have not figured out why they can't get the music to their SD cards. It's a business process, not a personal issue, or a technical aspect.I suggest they should put down their phones and live life a bit. Maybe even put a soundtrack to it."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "This Holloween Pumpkin Live Wallpaper is a fun interactive wallpaper that livens up your phone's background. This was one of Amazon's \"Free App of the Day\" so it was an easy choice to try. This wallpaper is a fairly simple game that allows you to explode regenerating pumpkins and knock vampire bats out of the air by tapping them in quick succession. This can cause the inadvertent launching of apps if you play this on a cluttered screen, so I only play it on a fairly empty screen.This is a seasonal app (at least for me) and I will likely change my wallpaper back to a picture of my family after Halloween.Recommended! This installed and ran perfectly on my HTC EVO 4G (Android v2.3.3).CFH"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Pretty much what it says on the box. An array of pumpkins &amp; bats appear on your home screens to be tapped and destroyed. If this sort of thing takes your fancy, by all means, download it free while you you have the chance. Otherwise, it isn't worth the normal asking price.It can be used either as a mini-game or live wallpaper. There are plenty of options for visual customization, but not a whole lot of gameplay, unless you create your own challenges like trying to keep the screen completely clear of targets or seeing how long it takes to get 1,000 points.To summarize, check it out if it looks good, play with it for 10 minutes, then uninstall &amp; go enjoy your Hallowe'en."}

Its sad though the author has moved on and made this app free and has never made any more cases...The one thing I would love is if the author made one last change to allow user imported images for cases... if i could get 2 more requests then make a user selectable color scheme for the flame colors as well...

How do I know what to edit if I don't know what it looks like?Other problems include a clunky interface and an inability to schedule posts.Some good points: I can easily jump between my blogs.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I have used this app for a month or 2 now.  I love it. It makes it very easy to post - update - edit- to your blog. You can upload videos or images. It has a drop down for category so you can see which ones you are using. There isn't one for tags though. Something I wish I had known prior to using more tagging then categories on my site. Everything works pretty flawlessly.  You can browse to your gallery and then click share and share to your wordpress blog. My only problem is that if you post pictures through here and you have a lightbox plugin on your site it doesn't seam to allow the images to lightbox out . I have to repost them."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Okay there was just an update, so some of this may have been addressed. I love the app when looking for a movie, and I am kind of an IMDb junkie so in general like the tool.The thing that was bugging me was the news feeds. They would get stale, and couldn't figure out how to refresh (and I am talking by weeks not hours).So that may have been addressed in the last release.Also would be nice to attach to Amazon more(since it is owned by them) so I could watch directly or see pricing easier but I may just not know how to work that.The trailer stream great even at 3G which is good when you got to entertain a 4 yo for a few minutes."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As has already been stated, this is really just another version of the mobile website, however I think that it has slightly better performance.  I prefer the app layout to the mobile theme because it just looks a little cleaner.That being said, IMDb is one of those websites that I can't live without.  Before I discovered IMDb, something or someone would come up in conversation and we would rack our brains trying to remember an actor's name or the name of the TV show that was being discussed.  Usually we wouldn't remember it and then sometime, days later even, in the middle of something completely unrelated, the name would pop into my head...  Alan Tudyk!  THAT'S IT!.  With IMDB, I can easily find what I'm looking for an get the answer immediately, rather than days (or weeks) later."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "It's true that this app doesn't have any additives and is really just a link to the IMDb website.  But, for me, it proved very useful today at a presentation where a former film critic for a major newspaper was discussing various films.  I was able to quickly access the IMDb website on my Kindle Fire, which proved quite useful in following the discussion.  I had previously used the website to look up movie times and to see where a movie was playing locally but I would not have used it in an audience setting if not for the app, which made it very easy to access the IMDb website.  For me, it's a valuable tool to have."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this game!!! I got it as a FAOTD last week and it is the only game I have been playing since then. It is a hybrid of a Boggle type word game and an RPG. The game begins in dungeon 1. You are given a random set of letter tiles to create words. The words you make are given point scores. The points are considered spells to defeat monsters that vary from 3 point rats to 98 point dragons. The point power of your words slay the monsters. This game is very engaging. The letters available for each dungeon even vary slightly because the more letters you use, the more bonus tiles, that can only used once, show up. I wish I didn't like this game quite so much. My house would be clean again!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I haven't seen any reviews that include this, so I'll edit if I figure out a way to avoid this. When you die in the game, you start over. Not the level, no... the entire game. Back to the first dungeon. Also, apparently I have to be very careful about hitting quit, otherwise your progress won't be saved. Other than those two issues I have, the game is fun. I feel a little helpless when I can't find a new word though."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have to agree with many other reviewers that it is frustrating to not be able to have your progress saved.  It is also a bit Monty Hall when looked at as a quest game instead of purely as a timed word game.It is a challenging word game, especially when you are attempting to make a word from rapidly shifting letter tiles.  I also find the objects found after defeating the various foes pretty amusing.All in all, a cute little word game with an interesting slant, good for a waiting-room game.  With a little more complexity (ie collecting found items for a bonus,  or perhaps an honest-to-goodness quest), and the option to save your progress,  this has the potential to be a 5-star game."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As a fan of dungeon crawlers AND word games, I couldn't pass this on up, especially as the FAOTD today.  I hadn't seen it before and probably would have paid for it as it sounded so intriguing.  I usually don't like timed word games as I'm not all that fast, but this one providers a reason to hurry besides a clock ticking - create quickly or die!  I like that!  It gives you the choice of three levels , kids, normal, or wizard which is great though I haven't checked out kids or wizard yet.  So I'm enjoying it so far and if I find it gets harder where I'm dying all the time, I can (shamefully) move to the kids level."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I enjoy playing it, but the first time I played it I got 9 dungeons in and the game quit responding and when I went back into it I had to start over from the 1st dungeon.I believe the game should save progress after every completed dungeon so if something happens or you just have to stop the game before dying or completing the dungeon you can reopen the game later on and continue from where you left off.Also instead of completely starting over each time maybe you should incorporate different lands or something that consists of a group of 5 or so dungeons that you can restart from if you die."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Really, this one is about a 3.5 for me.  However, I can't rate it that, so I rounded it down.  It's not good enough to round up to 4.The gameplay is simple enough, make words to defeat monsters.  However, it can get tricky because you get the same letters throughout an entire dungeon.  So, if you fight a bunch of bad guys, you can run out of ideas.  If that happens, you'll probably die.To be honest, I probably wouldn't have paid money for this game.  But, it was free today and it looked decent, so I got it.  Maybe I'll like it better over time."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Interesting game. I could care less for the story line but the game with its levels and bonus letters is fun and challenging. The dictionary that you play with has words that even people with a good vocabulary will never find them all. I like that it reminds you if you have already used a word. and that it allows plurals and other varients of the same word. Makes the game fun even for the children. It has three levels of play and that is good too. Over all its a little above average. Not my favorite game but certainly not one to uninstall the first day you have it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The game is fun until you get halfway through it and get a set of letters with no vowels so that you can't even make a word. When this happens, you can only sit there helplessly and watch yourself lose. I'd rather lose based on my own abilities not because the randomness of the game left me without any ability to continue. Fix this and you'll get your fifth star. May I suggest some sort of scramble option, even if it cost you points or abilities or something? May I also suggest code that makes absolutely sure there are 1 or 2 vowels in the letters at all times? Thank you!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The free Audible for Android app is a great option for me, as using this on my clunky, obsolete Entourage Pocket eDge tablet frees up so much space on my Kindle and ipod. The device is no longer upgradable, and is stuck at 2.1 or something. Few of the newer apps work on this device but I just got it last Sept from Woot at a deep discount and want to keep it as my tablet for now. I get such a charge when something works well, and the sound quality from the eDge is great to my tin ears. The Amazon apps are very hit or miss for this discontinued brick so I will be happy when I can get a K-Fire (II?) down the line."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I like this app a lot and have listened to several books.  You get one free audible book and after the first month, there is a monthly fee.  If you are pinching pennies this might not be for you.  You get a free credit each month for one free book.  To me, that more than pays for the fee.  There are also offers for books that can be purchased at low rates. I bought a book for $7.95 this month.  It's a very good deal, for me. It's easy to order books...I go to audible.com on my desktop computer, browse through the books, and place my order. I wait a few minutes, go to my Kindle and bring up the Audible book App...click on download. Some books take several minutes to download...Easy Peasy! I love it, you can control the volume and the speed of the reader."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I did have this app and have since deleted it AS MUCH AS I CAN.It seems it will not delete fully and I am . frankly, sick of trying all ways to GET RID OF IT!I deleted from apps.I deleted from cloud.I deleted it from manage your kindle.I deleted it from the apps in my kindle fire hd 7 inch (the settings sections) and it still shows as taking up over 8 MB of my kindle space.I wish to remove it please.It seems then that this app is invasive in some way and my extra app uninstaller and my virus/malware protection devices do not help either.I really would like to award this no stars at all with all the trouble it has caused AND CONTINUES TO BE WITH ME despite my best efforts."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this App after signing up with Audible for a monthly subscription for my Kindle Fire HDX. I purchased 2 Audible versions of books I own so wanted to be able to also listen using my cell phone (Android) when I don't have my Kindle. I downloaded this APP, signed in to my account and got an error message &#34;Password Error&#34; over and over again - 4 separate times, removing the App, then reinstalling it, retyping email address and password, repeatedly.... Ugh! So, I  decided to use the Online Technical Support Chat option to find out what was going on. I then get somebody who's even more ignorant than myself so, in my opinion, this App has been a huge waste of time. Sure hope Audible's products are okay with my Kindle because I sure can't use it for my cell. If this is how Audible performs, I will be quickly cancelling my account."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "When this app became available for Android I gave away my iPod nano. It is unbelievably convenient to download books directly whenever you want them! No mucking with awful iTunes.  I've been with Audible for nearly ten years now and this app is far and away the best listening experience I've ever used with the service.Audible itself is wonderful. You can read in so many places it's impossible to take a book. A good book makes your workout or commute fly by! It's a little weird at first--having books read to you--but if you stick with it, you'll quickly come to love Audible too."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "So the only time I ever use this app is if a friend is talking about an item they can't find. I always pull out my phone and see if Amazon has it and then tell them to get it on Amazon. I have made a couple of one click purchases on it in an emergency but otherwise I never use this.I pull Amazon up on my browser because this app really only has 2 functions: search for items, one-click. I can't view my orders, my account, track packages, or anything like that.I would just like to have more options that what is provided. Also, the layout is very difficult to navigate. I mean, if you are a loyal Amazon fan like me I'd download it just to have it but don't expect to use it much.99% of the time I just pull Amazon up on my phones browser since the app is so useless."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a must have app if you frequently shop on Amazon. It runs really smooth on my evo, makes shopping on amazon a breeze. Much easier to use than a mobile web browser to view the web page on your phone. I use it frequently when I am out shopping and want to check prices and reviews. Amazon is almost always cheaper than local stores, so its an easy way to save money.Ordering items through the app is very easy. I have completed the process several times and had no errors or order problems.The one problem I have with this app is the bar code scanner. I can almost never get bar code scanners to work and this app is no different. I often feel like an idiot standing in a store trying to get this app to read a bar code. On the flip side, the app almost always finds the item I am looking for when I search via keyword search or texting a picture."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Since this application became available last year I have been using it regularly to make educated decisions about what I buy in the local stores and what I buy on-line. It also provides me with the invaluable knowledge of the Amazon rating system that we all feed with our comments.I'm not going to add a bunch of pro's and con's here about the current version. We should reserve those for the feedback tool that the Amazon developers have.I will just add that the barcode scan and the photo recognition tools work phenomenal and the query is very quick. So, whether you grabbed something at The-X-store and want to see how good it is because it caught your eye, or if you are sure you want it, but you are concerned abut the price, this application will very likely help you decide what to do about it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "often i am looking for used art books and if i want to do a quick comparison shop i simply use this app to look up the item at amazon and quickly check the reseller prices.  then i switch to the ebay app and check the same item.  it is a toss up on which has the lower price.  it can go either way.  i simply swipe back and forth on my ipad to go from one app to the other.  the whole process takes at most five minutes and i can place a one click order on amazon if it has the better price.  this is much, much faster and easier than using the web browser.is this as fully featured as the web browser?  no it is not.  the ebay app is a lot more robust.  however, this is a really good start."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've had this app since 2011 and have been very happy with it.  However, last week I was prompted to update it so I did.  What a mistake!  Now it doesn't work.  It says it does not support digital purchases.  Then in physical merchandise, there is no Buy button.  So it doesn't work!  I've got it installed on a Samsung Galaxy 3S phone, the same device I've had it on for over a year.  So it was that last update that rendered it unusable for Samsung products.  If you have it already and it is working, DON'T UPDATE it!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Unlike most other apps that only want a few hundred dollars to keep the game up-to-date, this app is like staring down into the main intake of the money shredder of the US Mint.  Very habit forming, much worse than heavy drugs, it's SO easy to tap away all your money, creating a deluge of really nice Amazon &#34;stuff&#34; you don't really need as much as food or toilet paper./SARCASM OFF/Darn, look!

{"label": 1, "raw": "It does a decent job with just searching, so props for that..I guess. It's ok for price comparing, but there are apps that do just that better. Lacks a lot of the convenience amazon is known for. Can't really just browse, which for an app, thats exactly what i'd actually want to do. As other guy mentioned, the permissions this app asks for, a little strange. With that and the overall experience this app feels more like bloatware, something that verizon would stick on a phone, than a clean app that makes my life easier. Lot of potential in a good amazon app, so I hope they put more time into this."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this for my Nexus 7 tablet. It works as expected, allowing me to search for and order items, and also to access my previous orders, wishlist, etc.  The user interface is considerably simplified compared to the full browser page version. That's appropriate because most Android devices, smartphones and tablets, have much less screen area to display info.  It's a free app, so there's no downside to trying it out. You may like it. If not, you can always user your browser app to connect to Amazon.com"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I find it hard to give Amazon my money when the shopping experience is so frustrating. The app can't filter by price, by free shipping, by ratings.. I can see my order history and tracking, which is good, but there's no link to the items so I can reorder or write a review. Clicking on the &quot;full site&quot; link sorta works, except as soon as you click on a link, it reverts to mobile. I usually give up and don't end up buying what I was looking for, so I'm calling this app a failure."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "It's a very good scanner program and is very easy to use and understand and works great on my Kindle Fire HD. I only have one disappointment about it. I live out in the country and about 40 miles or so from our County Sheriffs Office and the county I live in is not listed. So, I have to set it for the large city that's about 30 miles away and not in the County in which I live. We have no local Police Department and our local volenteer volunteer fire department is not listed in it either."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app does exactly as advertised. Cant believe how much information ive learned since I began listening to the scanner radio channels in my area. What Ive discovered that's really cool is:  You know those  times when you see CURRENT breaking news on CNN, or your local TV news station? Well, often times, you can pick up the police or fire radio channel in that particular area if the state, town or city is announced. You can then, possibly hear any new information way before anyone else or if, at all!If I could only have just10 apps, I would have to include Scanner Radio Pro!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This to date is the best mobile checkers app I have come around, game play is great and the UI interference is well designed, the android computer opponent can be set to challenge your level of experience, this app also includes 2 player mode so you can play against your folks. Overall I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking or a good time and a sturdy checkers app on the go. There is also a free version of this app called checkers free which is basically the same, but if you enjoy this game frequently remember to support its creators who brought you the opportunity to enjoy it, you will also want the paid version if you detest advertisement which can get annoying and in the way of your game play. This publisher also offers an outstanding chess app if you like to play chess, it's called chess premium or chess free."}

I am always looking for thinking games to play and Checkers is a great beginner for a little one to test their skills.

Try it I am sure you will enjoy playing it. And of course it's free!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "As many have said, this follows a very similar premise to the classic. Pac-Man. The controls are very simple and easy to use, and I like that it's not a joystick like other games. I move off joysticks and lose control, having a control point to touch around is very nice.The 'calibration' (moving the control point) is supposed to be long-pressing the control point for 3 seconds, but for me it seemed more like 5-6 seconds.The messages do pop-up quite frequently, so turning them off is a must (haven't done it yet, but noticed a review said you could). A better option would be text popping up along the top, not a box pausing the game every 5 seconds.Great game, love it, love the new control point control scheme, far easier to use than virtual joysticks."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game presents a clean aesthetic where you control a square that must escape the other &#34;evil&#34; squares trying to catch you.  You get some neat powerups that let you destroy them (like the power pellets in Pac-Man) and there are some other puzzle-type elements.  However, after just a few levels you feel as if the game has run out of ideas and you're stuck just playing more difficult versions of the previous levels.  It also tries to present a &#34;story&#34; with quotes from certain other block characters but it all falls a little flat."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Anyone who doesn't give this game a proper chance and passes it off as a pac-man ripoff is sorely missing out.  It has action, puzzle-solving, stealth, and humor.  It requires quick thinking and reflexes, tests your wits under pressure, and is a whole heck of a lot of fun to play.  The simplistic graphics are crisp and vibrant.  The controls, while not perfect, get the job done.  I did have a bit of trouble during the last couple of levels where pinpoint accuracy is required to successfully evade the onslaught of red blocks, but this was far from detracting enough to keep me from loving it.  I never expected to like this game so much, but it turned out to be a real treat."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was a big fan of their other game, Radiant HD, so I was expecting another great one here. Although this isn't my typical genre of game, the premise is promising. Unfortunately, the game is ruined by a tiny control pad in order to navigate around. Yes, you can move the joystick location by holding down it down, but my issue is with the size of it. It is simply just too small, so you're constantly pressing on the wrong direction or area. Fix this minor problem and this game would get five stars from me!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "this game is way better than pac-man because it has more things you can do then pac-man. I wont give any of the secrets away, but u can move stuff and trigger things and even get shockers that make the red squares(bad guys) freeze for a bit...( kind of like pac-man). There is only one thing I would change and that would be the controls. idk how I would improve them,but now they are abut hard and ive died a few times because of them. but besides that, this game is awesome!! #waybetterthanpac-man(;"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is top notch. This is like Pacman, but better I think. There are elements of this game that surpasses expectation. The controls are fine, and I was able to play with effective accuracy on my first tries.The game looks and feels great. Worth a good score. This game had been out for quite a while on the google play store. People there seem to navigate the controls just fine and downloaded by the THOUSANDS!! -(4 1/2 stars on google)-EVAC is a tried and true game, minimal permissions IMO and top 10 FAOTD for the year. Hexage is a top developer with good support. Not sure why Amazon users are hyper critical on FA'sOTD!With no IAP, reasonable permissions, decent controls and gorgeous retro style graphics. This game is worth is price! Ignore the cheepos that can't use there touch screens.Support this developer, they make great games with good support and is a mature company that innovates its products well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really enjoyed this at first, but eventually the non-intuitive and clunky controls made it impossible to move blocks or escape the red guys at a fast enough  pace.Another annoying thing was the messages from the evil guy would interrupt the game and put a modal dialog box on top of the screen which obscured the maze. You'd have to click to dismiss it and meanwhile you were interrupted in the middle of escaping from the red guys, and when the box went away you'd have to quickly figure out where you are and what you were doing. I lost a lot of life points because of this. They should have the boss's taunts appear in an area separate from the maze so it doesn't interrupt the game.Otherwise the game was fun, and the power-ups were a nice addition to Pac-man."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Pros:1) Is fairly feature-rich2) Has an associated thesaurus2) Not much elseCons:1) Larger than advertised - installs at 6.18MB, NOT 3.12.2) Requires an internet connection (to support the ad bars along the bottom - why else not have the word list and definitions on the device instead on lookup).3) Fairly large memory footprint. Not a problem for more modern devices or those with memory to spare but smaller or slower units will suffer.Overall, not that terrible if you don't mind the ads and the forced internet connection (both of which I despise), but might require that you watch the memory usage."}

Most (but not all!) programs have Vegas scoring, but very few have visually appealing cards.  They are invariably, crude, fuzzy, or just plain unpleasant to look at.  Solitaire (Free) is one of two apps of the nearly dozen I've looked at that satisfy both of my criteria.  The other is Klondike Solitaire by Softick Ltd.  Unfortunately, Amazon system won't let me insert a link to the Amazon page for the other app, but you can find it by using Amazon's search feature."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "If you've played one version of this type of game, you've pretty much played them all. There's nothing uniquely special about this version (other than the price - I was able to pick it up when it was the free app of the day). It's your standard block moving game... rearrange the blocks to clear the puzzle and move onto the next. A great little game to pick up and tinker with for short periods of time while waiting for the train, bus, at the doctor's office, etc. This one is exactly what I expected it to be."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "When I first played this game, I thought, &#34;Not too bad of a game.&#34;  Now that I've played it a few times, I'm not as excited as I was when I played it the first time.  It was a good game, I think I lost interest mainly because it was the same ole thing over and over again, just a little more challenging than the previous round...  It can keep me busy while I wait in line or at the doctors office though. :)"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really like the app. This slide puzzle modifies to play in both angels on your fire it also has soothing music that you can turn off however if it annoys you. There are no penelties for going over the given moves to solve which allows you to try more puzzles.  It doesn't hold you back do my 6 yr old is happy after move 100 when he finally solves the harder ones but to be honest this only held his attention for three plays. I don't see myself playing it often but it is a nice game for those who enjoy these and to me was calming.Florida Mom"}

{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a good game. It is nice to be able to play the game against the computer, because then you don't have to admit to anyone else that you like to play hangman. ;)However, I HATE the font. It's hard to read some of the letters. For example, the \"O\" looks like a diamond that has been hollowed out, and it has four sides. I suppose it is supposed to look like someone chiseled the words out of a rock tablet, but it doesn't, and it's just annoying. When you're using letters to guess a missing word, and you have to keep remembering what the letter you're looking at represents, that's a drawback. With a better font, this game would have rated five stars."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is hard.And its always acting up.If y'all like like this y'all crazy! Like this one time I put in the right answer and it put in a really bad word so I called the people that owened the game and they said they ment to do that so I said this is a bad game they said don't talk to me like that they said a cusing. word thetheman said I know where you live I said I'm going to call the police ok he said. a bad word THAT'S. MY REVIEW YALL!!!!!!!!! DON'T FALL FOR IT YALL!!!!!!$$$$$$ LOVE NUMBER 7"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is really good. I love it but the only downside is that when you play single player your playing with the computer and the computer gives you words that you don't even know. Like krill like seriously 5 years old play this there not going to know what that is. And the computer  is hard to beat it like wins every time. I highly recommend this game to people who love hangman and want their kids to enjoy. But if you let your child use this game don't let them play single it's t ok hard. Play with them and go easy on them their little. Really get thus game it's so fun!!!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I can't vouch for its completeness or its accuracy, or how up-to-date it is, but I have used it to review real estate prices in several areas around the country, and it came up with a lot of data very quickly.  It settled a kind of argument between me and my wife; turns out I was right that a house down the block has been on the market for over a year.  You can probably find this same kind of data more quickly and easily on a computer, but if you just have a phone, this is a great little tool."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have used this product on my computer for many years, but are the values the true value or deflated values.  It seems with the real estate downfall, no one knows the true value of their home these days.  And if you are trying to buy or sell, people go to Zillow to see what they value the property.  I think we should go back to what appraisers think the property is worth, because realtors do not know any more.  They and the banks are the ones who got us into this trouble, only my opinion."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire.  It is loaded with useful information and pretty easy to use.  It does not come with any detail instructions or help menu on how to use, but most of it is self-apparent.. Much detail information about the house being looked at can be seen by scrolling down the pop-up window that opens when a home in the map is clicked-on.  I did find-out by hapenstance that when a home for sale has associated pictures in this pop-up, they can be viewed full-screen by clicking (just once) on one of them.Unfortunately, when I checked my neighborhood for housing activity I was surprised to find that one home that sold recently, and another that has been on the market for a few weeks now were not identified as such (and yes I preset the Zillow filter to include homes for sale and those recently sold)."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I love this app.  I use it on my home computer all the time.  Every real estate agent says NO NO NO  don't use this let me get your info, but in my experience this gives me comps, five years worth of taxes and graphs to show what the house and surroundings are doing, past and present sales.  Also what the list prices on the houses and what Zillow thinks they are should be selling for.  Most times the houses sell closer to Zillow estimates that what they agents listed the houses for. Great App"}

I even prayed that this here would open. nothing nothing NOTHING!!!!!FIX THIS CRAP AND I WILL GIVE BETTER RATING.

{"label": 1, "raw": "I've used Zillow on an iPad and loved it, and I was very happy to see it in the Amazon Android app store. It installed and runs fine on my Kindle Fire. I'm not planning to move anytime soon, so I don't really NEED Zillow, but it's one of the most interesting apps I've seen, so I WANT it. Let's face it, it's fun to look up friends' and relatives' homes and see what they're worth. Call it anonymous snooping!Zillow keeps getting better and better, with its filters, graphs of value over the years, and actual photos of many houses. The Kindle Fire has a big enough screen size that it's easy to view properties from a Google Earth view on one side and a Charts and Data view on the other side.A very useful app and one that could be extremely valuable for anyone planning to buy or sell a property."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a really cool app that is map based. If you have your GPS signal on your device on it quickly shows what's available around you. Don't worry you can look up any area just by searching for it. I like this app because you can customize your search to only show the places you want to see. For an example you can set it to have a house built in the 2000s that is at least 1,500 sq ft that's less than $500,000. You can look at pictures of the place if they are any posted. You can make the pictures full screen or simply keep it small to quickly look through them. You can sign up to actually have an account or connect with Facebook as well to save favorites or to share with family and friends. I haven't had any problems with this app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Other websites about real estate only list properties currently on the market. This one give the value of all properties. I looked up my own home and found an underestimated quote but I was able to add details to the description that changed the value. Now when you look up my home you can see a more accurate value. If you live in a tract development this may be helpful but where my home is each house is different,custom built, so all are different. This site also give past selling values of homes and that can be a real eye opener especially in this changing market."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This app runs smoothly and allows me to find properies via a map then click on each for more details. The down side is not all properties for sale in the area are on the app. I have found others by going to the different reealtor's websites that did not show up on the app. However - most are there and so I think it is well worth it. I am currently looking at another state, but I think when I get to the point of actually driving around to the properties it will be more usueful. I'd say - if you are looking to buy - this app is for you!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "After entering my FL Zip Code, the data that appeared is in Hamilton, IN.  And, there seems to be no way/nobody to contact at Zillow when you see a &#34;problem&#34;.  Other issues include incorrect values of properties and listing of sale of my residence since I have been living here???  No way was my property sold to anyone but me!  Also, recent sale $ of property in my neighborhood is incorrect!?  Can't use this app since it's not reliable."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have been a subscriber to Zillow's web site for almost 2 years. This application does much more than what I was ever able to do on my phone. I have had great success in saving my searches for specific properties as well as searching for specific locations. This is a tool that I would rate as a must have for someone wanting to relocate, research, or invest in property. I would strongly recommend this application! I have not once been disappointed in my research using the Zillow app on my Kindle Fire."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I don't know what some of the people are complaining about.  This app on my Kindle Fire shows all the holidays that I can think of and I can't find any missing.  It is a great little app for calculating the number of days between two dates and has enough other features to help with other date related information (find a week number of a date or vice versa, learn about a specific date, add or subtract from a specific date, show events for a date, or show upcoming Friday the 13th dates for the superstitious crowd.At 345K on the Kinddle Fire it is not a space hog in the least.  Overall, I would have given this a 4 out of 5 just because it is so specific an app, but I disagree with many of the low ratings for this app so I've given it a 5 to offset some of the undeserved bad press."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm appalled at the level of ignorance and vitriol in these reviews. How can this app steal contact data when it doesn't have network permission? Access to contact data is required to add birthdays, anniversaries, or appointments. It's a shame that ignorance and anger is leading to fewer developers submitting good apps for FAotD. Amazon app reviews are rife with ignorant trolls who have inflated egos, an unwarranted sense of entitlement, and who aren't half as smart as their smart-phones.This app works great for its intended purpose. It's a handy adjunct to my Google Calendar."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is OK for when you are trapped in a queue and you are sick of people-watching, but the game is a bit of a bore.  It works well and I understand why it is full of ads (stuff has to be paid for somehow) and it is a free app. but I became tired of this almost on day one.  Something about the colours is a bit icky in my opinion.  But it was free so I appreciate having the chance to try it out."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Okay, well I suppose this app would be okay (actually it would probably be my favorite password manager) if it weren't for the fact that it let's the leeboard remember EVERYTHING you type in. For example, I decided to try it & the first thing I did was put in a login/password combo. Well, when I entered my password, it didn't show a blank suggestion bar on my keyboard. It showed my whole password right there for my phone to remember! (Yikes!!) So I haven't used itsince, because I don't trust it to keep my passwords safe."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Yesterday, I upgraded my Evo to Gingerbread. After the update, the password manager that I was using wouldn't even open. I was perturbed. This morning I checked the Amazon free app of the day, and saw this. I downloaded it, and am in the process of retreiving all of my passwords one by one to enter in to this app.This app has many customizable categories, many of which I will never use. So, I just delete the entire category. This app is EXTREMELY customizable.I really don't see what there is to dislike about this very useful app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The password generator is nice, especially with the options it gives.It really needs a bit better up-front documentation on the way it works as far as locking and such.My biggest concern is the permissions. I am fairly sure it's safe, and I understand why it is asking for them, but I cannot condone using any app which holds sensitive data to request any permission allowing network access and things which 'could' be used maliciously.Cool features, but not going to use anything but the generator."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I purchased this for my computer and have used it much more than I expected.  I was thrilled when Amazon offered it as a FAOTD!  I was able to easily synch with my existing account using DropBox, so no I have access to this information no matter where I am!  I prefer the computer version (keyboard is easier to use than the little one on the phone) for data entry, but it is nice to have access when I need it.  The program is essentially a database with many different configurations for storing the information.  I now use it as my address book, keep track of accounts and most importantly the various passwords required for all the different sites.  All this stuff is heavily encrypted and password protected, so I feel safe using it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "i have mSecure on my PC desktop, iPod and Kindle Fire HD. I use this app everyday on my PC - I like the security of having a backup on my tablet devices. At best I can say that it's a very stable app and the sync works perfectly. At worst the Android app is way overpriced for what little value it offers. However, it's GUI is underwhelming and setting up a new type requires each and every field to be set up manually - not even a default 10 field setup or ability to copy from another form. Changing the type can result in lost fields. The copy/paste to feature is a bit wonky - but it's probably the fault of Windows or the FireFox browser."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I'm not a huge fan of the labyrinth type of game, and this is one of the less well polished versions I've tried. The graphics are quite mediocre. The ball seemed to want to catch and get hung up on everything. Many of the mazes have openings that are just a wee bit too small to get the ball through, so you have to figure out the proper path in addition to avoiding the pitfalls. Most annoying however are the moving sections, which can make the difference between finishing in a few seconds and taking a minute or more to finish.The app also has OpenFeint, for those of you who don't like being spied on.I think $4 is far too much for this game. $2 would be a more reasonable price, if it were a bit more polished. In its current state, 99 cents would be appropriate.Works on the Evo 3D and the Xoom."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Was looking for a game my 3 year old could play.  It's a little complex at times on very easy due to narrow gaps, but I think he had fun with it as did I.  No excessive permissions, opted out of the social plugin.  Graphics are fun as the walls give a shift in perspective making a 3d feel as you look done.  Recommend for something to pick up and play quick without feeling like you have to play longer unless you want to.  Check it out while it's free!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was glad to see this game offered for free on Amazon. I had the free version, ad supported, and ended up uninstalling it. The ads were just way to annoying trying to play, other than that I loved this game. It's very challenging, and forcing you to focus on eye-hand control. It does get frustrating as you move up through the levels, but not enough that it isn't addicting. If you like puzzle games this is a fun game! Also works great on my HTC Evo 3g."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "A very useful app that allows you to track all of your accounts, set a budget, remind you when bills are due, even do transfers between accounts. It makes you keep actively aware of your finances.It is not connected to any accounts so you do have to keep your records as frequently as you do you check book. The app makes you accountable for your money giving you all the tools to keep an accurate accounting but it will not do it for you. If you forget or don't keep up with your spending it will fail you and frustrate you, but if you keep up with your accounts it will keep you balanced and disciplined. It has made me more accountable for my follies and more disciplined in understanding where my money is going, bad or good."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "*some* people (not naming names) have posted reviews when they don't even have the app.. very sad! I have only played with a few of the functions, but so far it seems to be a pretty good financial app!  It *is* free.. if you bother to actually hit the \"purchase\" button, instead of coming on the review site and griping about something that has *nothing* to do with the performance of the app, your conformation e-mail will tell you it was free. It must be a glitch in the way Amazon posted it.. it has nothing to do with the developer, or the app!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "it seems odd that a free app like mint.com will populate all of your data for you but easy money requires a tremendous amount of data input.I agree with bacchus' review below so I won't repeat it, but this app appears well suited for people who don't know how to manage their money and don't realize that 9 dollars for an app is ridiculous when a better, free app is available.the app does do exactly what it says so I will give it 3 stars but I would be very disappointed if I paid for this.thank you amazon for the free app of the day."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've been using this app for 2 months on droidX with an occasional FC I could live with in reboot its that good. but I just upgraded to Droid RAZR and it stores photos on external SD storage, this app us nit picking up the receipt photos. also I bought from Amazon market but when I am prompted to review the app it opens Play where I cannot leave a review for it.  don't let these 3 stars stop you from buying this excellent app.  if dev fixes the RAZR photo issue I will be updating this review. the photos are important to me as they are proof of taxes paid"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I snapped this up for the FAOTD, hoping to finally get a grip on my budget.But if you get bi-weekly payments, you are SOL. There isn't an option for bi-weekly pay. Which is quite a glaring omission. Just doubling up doesn't work, since with bi-week you can get more than two payments every so often.Please fix! I don't mind this since I got this for free, but if I had paid almost ten bucks for a budget app that doesn't contain one of the most common types of pay periods? I'd be ticked."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This is a very good app, and they asked me to rate it five stars if I enjoyed it, so, yea. But, I got this app for free, part of amazon's &quot;Paid free app everyday&quot; thing, ( which I find awesome.) Though, it may feel very good for the kindle fire, (because I know that there are some apps that just do not even seem remotely good), have a nice sound of a cash register whenever you put a transaction in, and come ready to go, there are some free apps that can do the exact same thing as this app, maybe even better. $10.00 to be able to track your money? You will be using the app and wondering where the $10.00 went."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I am not sure what the people who are complaining about this app are taking about. I have been using this app for a while, and have had no problems with it. As far as having to manually enter transactions I don't have a problem with it. There are many times when I go and buy a number of different items that are in different categories. If these transactions were automatically entered it wouldn't show that. In fact if the transactions were all entered automatically it would not show any categories. The bank certainly wouldn't know what category to put a transaction in. I have found that the app is very easy to use, and works very well despite having to take 15 or 20 seconds to enter a transaction."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "EasyMoney is pretty easy and intuitive and more importantly, it's reliable.  No big bugs to report.  I used to use Splashmoney on my old PalmPilot.  It was great.  I was going to buy the version for the Kindle Fire, but saw more than one really bad review.  So, I looked around and saw that EasyMoney had some pretty good reviews.  Once I finish putting in my budgets, and set up my regular transfers and payments, I think I will find EasyMoney very useful."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this free today, so I figured that I would check it out. In my opinion, it's not worth $10. The layout is beautiful but that's just about all it has. The biggest feature that I would like is to have this sync with my accounts. It's not here. You literally have to enter any/every transaction manually. I think this app would be helpful if I had tons of different accounts and wanted to have everything available quickly in one place, but I don't. Even if I did, I can't see why I would want to manually enter every single transaction into my phone when online banking or viewing statements online is free everywhere. It's easier for me to use Pageonce for my needs. I don't see why anyone would prefer this over any of the free money apps out there. If this app actually synced with my bank accounts automatically, I'd have made a completely different review."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I've been using this app since the first of the year. Most of the time it works well but I have found some errors in the Bill Reminder feature. If you pay a bill prior to the date in the Bill Reminder, you can mark it paid but then on the actual date it will post again, deducting it a second time. Luckily I check my entries every day so I can monitor this flaw.The second thing I would like to see is a way to export my entries so they can be printed out. With no way to back up this program, I worry about what happens if my Kindle Fire crashes.The reports: mostly useless."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have a few accounts in a few currencies. This app doesn't have any conversion, doesn't support conversion rates, doesn't support transfer between accounts in different currencies, etc. so if I'm now in Eurozone country and use my American card to withdraw cash in euro, I can't manage this with this app. Since I have more euro cash and less dollars but it's a transfer actually. You can't also get a summary of your accounts or any reports that include add all your accounts, just currency by currency. This makes the app totally useless. AndroMoney handles it and is free. Uninstalled."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I have been doing this kind of cash flow monitoring in excel for many years and have finally found a good replacement with this app.  I like the future recurring transactions capability the best so I can forecast my cash flow multiple months at a time.  I would give this app the full 5 stars but the backup and export features cause the app to force close.  this is very unfortunate as I purposefully bought the app with these features in mind.  oh well.  it still rates high for me anyway.  htc incredible."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Worked on other Kindles, just not on Kindle HDX. The app's UI functions for me, but the streams are choppy and go in and out. Pandora and Digitally Imported do not do this. I have tested on home network and at work and I get the same thing. This was my favorite radio app. Hopefully they will fix soon.I used Tune In for Years. Thankfully there was IHeartRadio which give me the local radio I need with my Kindle HDX. I installed and it works as advertised on my Kindle HDX. The one CON against IHeart;  Tune In still has maximum flexibility to find all the terrestrial and online stations. Something that IHeartRadio cannot do. I wish they'd fix TUNE in for Kindle HDX. Based other reviews TUNE In is in no hurry to do so. Too Bad.Update 11/06/2013:They fixed it and all seems to be OK again. I guess I can uninstall IHeartRadio now."}

Also my tablet uses FROYO kinda old now but still is able to play and use thousands of apps.."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I really like this app a lot but of course you can't use it if you are away from your wi-fi signal. And we can only use up so much data allowance per day. An app like this will quickly go through all your allowance. We are on satellite and don't have the most expensive plan so we do have to be careful of how much we use. But it will be really nice if we are staying in a motel where we can listen to the music all night. Which by the way, you can choose any state, then any station and then any type of music. Even talk radio. Anything you could possibly want to listen to. Probably one of the nicest apps around."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was very pleased with this app. I have an Internet radio and it occurred to me that there should be an app for Internet radio and I found this one and gave it a shot. I was especially pleased to find the police and fire radios on it. That's a nice bonus if you hear sirens and wonder what's going on. In a matter of seconds I can have the local emergency radio channels on and be listening to what's going on. It's been a very good little app for me. I like it a lot."}

Add songs and artists to ur favorite tad and either buy the song or see if its anywhere on the radio.PLZ do me a huge favor and get!!!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was looking for an app that would let me listen to live streaming radio stations.  I have other apps for when I want to listen to &#34;genres&#34; of music pulled from a music library -- apps like Pandora, and even iHeartRadio.  But many of the other apps don't do live streaming -- or don't do it well.I often base my initial satisfaction with an app on how quickly I can open the app for the first time and get to what I want to do.  When I installed TuneIn Radio, it was because I wanted my favorite local FM station -- WDAV, a 24/7 Classical music station -- available when I was not at/near an FM radio.  I was up and running, listening to the station in just a minute or two.  That's &#34;ease of use&#34;."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "was tipped to this app by an Apple employee. Thanks! I needed a radio streaming app to get away from massive commercials and wimpy programming. TuneIn finds worldwide radio stations. Sometimes there are buffering issues. You can search by genre, etc. I had major buffering issues with an Itunes radio station - Venice Classical radio.  ( my favourite - just fine music, no commercials or rude interruptions like &#34;subscribe now!&#34; )Tunein has replaced Itunes Radio for this purpose. Very user friendly, many choices and a good alternative to Pandora as well."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I don't write many app reviews ... because most range from useless to \"eh\". TuneIn Radio, however, is incredibly useful and amazingly fun! I can listen to local radio stations, public access radio (scanners, health services), and a huge number of world-wide stations of all sorts; both over the air and internet, including my favorite melodic pop station, Alan Haber's Pure Pop Radio!! My Kindle is now my radio, as well as my book and my gameboy! Happy am I!!!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I was looking for a stream to listen to the Pats playoff game.I realized I needed an app.Google App Store came up with TuneIn,great reviews so I got the free version just to hear the game......YA Right.I realized very fast that this app lets me listen to radio stations from all over the World!!It lists in real time what songs are being played on 100's of stations.If you search a band it shows what stations are playing that band.I found a 128kbs station in Hondorus that plays only Pink Floyd(some VERY deep rare songs)!! I am going to get the pro,right now,for 99c(On Amazon).With it you can record content to your memory card!! I thought Pandora was good,TuneIn blows it away.I was missing a real person talking on the other end of my \"radio\".Missing it no more.Technology is great....sometimes!! This time!!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "TuneIn radio is an excellent app. For some esoteric reason, our local AM and FM stations are practically unintelligible - this application has given us a clear and reliable alternative to constantly looking for the right configuration of dial position, antenna placement, and mojo.TuneIn has a variety of useful features including a timer, alarm, presets, and a surprisingly good search function. I especially like how the search will group talk shows by how much time is remaining. It's nice to be able to catch that talk radio program at the beginning!"}

It works amazingly well on my HTC Inspire 4G, and it is not complicated to learn to maneuver through it and find what you want to hear. There are so many good choices for listening. I was a little disappointed to find out that my two local hometown stations aren't there, but then a message in the app told me that they have not been made available for streaming."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Easy to work within, good selection of stations. makes it easy to find music you are in the mood to listen to. I like being able to have favorite stations and also recent station for reference. You can also listen to news,  events, just search and you will find something to enjoy. I have this on my phone to listen with earplugs outdoors while gardening as a change from my iPod. I used to live on the other coast so it is fun for me to listen to stations from that area but there are also stations around the world as well better than a previous app and much better than iHeart radio app."}

The selection of music is fantastic and I love the fact that I can just relax and listen to the radio or do other things on my tablet while I listen to my favorite music. I like the fact that you can preset your favorite stations so there is no searching around trying to find them again. The variety of radio stations is really good ... there is something for everyone! If you like to listen to the radio, this is the app for you!"}

{"label": 1, "raw": "Easily the best radio app I've seen. I replaced Slacker Radio and Scanner Radio with TuneIn as it does everything that both apps do better, and without any of the artificial limitations placed on most free apps. It certainly encouraged me to purchase the paid version. There is also no intrusive / annoying advertising.Pros:-- Wide selection of Radio stations, emergency bands, online streams, etc.-- No annoying advertising.-- No features advocating the paid version (features not available in the free version are taken out, and don't get in your way or pop up asking you to upgrade).-- UI is well done, and always keeps the currently playing station handy at the bottom so you can stop and start it quickly.Cons:-- None that I can honestly list as cons. It would be nice to be able to record radio, however, as this is in the paid version I can't honestly list it as a con."}

{"label": 1, "raw": "Who needs satellite radio with this application? Well maybe you do because the interface for TuneIn Radio is clunky.The people who designed the user interface must be mass transit commuters because I'm convinced they've never used this in a car before.You have to pull over to use make simple changes in your car. You can't do simple stuff quick enough during a red light. I get about 80% of the way there when the light turns green, then at the next red light you have to start over again. But the radio selection is excellent and the quality is great. I play it through the Blue Tooth on my car radio.I wish it had a BIG Radio Button Feature so that I could change stations easily and a Re-Connect button when I lose a connection.It's close, real close, to being a great application."}

It goes into details about each sign. Each element. Each phase. Astro tools. And of course, don't forget the love and romance section all to itself. It's informative. It's interesting and goes way into depths of star and planet alignments...EVERYTHING.. Nope. This is not just one of those fortune cookie type things...I use it everyday. It's the first thing I look at. Even before e mails or news. Great great app. I would suggest this one above all others. And believe me, I've tried a few!"}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The planes are shooting each other, and you have a classical music in the background. Funny to me. I enjoyed playing it. It's very touch responsive on Kindle Fire, and Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I played only a few level and enjoyed the game play so far. It's simple, and cute. Not too many buttons to press. The planes that has higher speed, makes me dizzy. It spins so fast, and moves so fast. I prefer the slower planes.  My 2 years old son love to crash the plane. Definitely worth 2.99 but I got it as free app of the day."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This game is playing great so far. What I appreciate are that the controls are nice, and you get that 3D aspect where it feels like you are flying. That is one of the best parts for me, as it is amazingly fun, and I can see a lot of people gravitating towards this game for that particular reason. The music used in the game is beautiful and very soothing as you try to blast other planes out of the sky. The game itself is very easy to play, but going for all planes can be quite frustrating at times. It is worth the price and a fun time killer."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "I got this as the FAOTD a few days ago, and have been addicted ever since.  I still havent beaten the game, but I think I want to unlock all the planes and this is just anperfect time waster.  I can assure you that this is more than worth the purchase price.Good:*Gameplay is simple enough to jump right in, but deep enough that you don't get bored.*Loads of planes to unlock, and each one plays differently combining one of 7 different weapons with varrying levels of turn, speed, and health.*The mix of enemies on each wave is often challenging, sometimes sending you back to previous levels to unlock a better plane.*Multiplayer (haven't personally tried)Bad:*doesm't look like it would work well on a phone*occasionally the controls lock up, but that might just be my tablet."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "The concept and gameplay is pretty excellent.  However, there are a very limited amount of levels and the unlockable planes aren't unique enough to waste time grinding to unlock them.  It would have been better if you were given a base plane and then play to unlock the speed, armor, design, and weapon upgrades to customize your plane.  Adding achievements, as is the current trend for casual mobile games, would also add a bit more longevity to this title.But for what it is, its a good, cheap time-waster for the week or so it takes you to beat it."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "This version is completely non-functional.  It's old, and from before Twidroyd had their API key suspended from the market.  It was out of date even on Amazon's launch day.  If you want to use this app, go to the market.  Hopefully they'll update this here and this review won't apply, but right now it's an old out of date app that doesn't work.  Honestly, this concerns me about the whole Amazon market concept.  If a developer isn't going to update apps here, and if it were a paid app, you'd be out of luck."}

For ex, it has a barcode scanner--very easy to use and you don't need any extra app to use it--that automatically adds the scanned food into your tracker. If you are used to counting calories and factoring in exercise (for ex, on a points plan that incorporates both, such as WW) you'll find this app (and the online site) intuitive and simple. Also, the app, unlike the site, gives you a running total of the day's nutrition information all on one page so you can quickly see, for ex, if you haven't had enough protein for the day. Nothing but good things to say about this app."}
{"label": 1, "raw": "Easy to use.  The database of bar codes is very complete, almost every grocery item I scan is found.  The syncing between devices and the web site is quick and reliable.  Works great on my phone and my Kindle Fire.  Custom food, recipes, and exercise activities are simple to add and incorporate.  Not too complicated, so it's easy to get in the habit of using it and seeing calories consumed vs burned at a glance.  Finally, because the database of foods is so complete, the macro and micro nutrition report is useful and trustworthy wothout having to manually enter these details."}

They have been used a few times already and do what they are supposed to - no complaints there.What I will say is that 12 feet really isn't an ideal length.  Sure, if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long, but a lot of times you will be beside another car or can't get really close.  Because of this, I would recommend something a little longer than 12'.Great brand - get 16' version though."}

All of them seem to dump tons of dust on my poor car. This model comes with the wood handle. Others out there have a cheap plastic one. Read the directions on the cover. You're suppose to let it air out after shipping. It has something to do with the wax on the brush. It also will tell you not to worry about it getting dirty. In fact its suppose to work better as it gets dirtier. The duster will work even better if you put a sealant and/or wax on your car. You'll find that you can pull a lot more material off your car. The duster will easily remove pollen, dust, and any other light coating of material. It will remove the dust from hard water and rain deposits, but you'll still see the marks if you look carefully. Buy this product. You're call will thank you!"}

It is true what they say about the more you use it the better it cleans.  If you use it a lot it will start to turn black but it will start cleaning better than ever.  It is great to wipe light dirt and dust off your car and makes it look like you just waxed your car.  If you take care of it then it should last for many years."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Like most car detail enthusiasts, I never liked to see 3 hours of detailing work destroyed in a couple of days of driving and parking. With this brush, my detail jobs last longer. The brush is gentle on the clear coat but it does sweep the dust away, leaving water and and bird droppings behind.For best results, I recommend that you clay clean the car with a good car clay and wax it with S100 car wax every few months. Then using this brush, you can maintain your car in show room condition for a long time without having to wash it."}

Once I found out, I knew it was the cracked hose.  Cleared the message using this unit, and it never came back.  Had I taken it to a mechanic or dealer, they'd probably have told me it was some other problem and I wouldn't have know if they were telling me the truth or not."}

The 2 pieces fit together by grooves.  Slide and you can adjust by pulling/pushing to get it to fit on vent.3.  Magnets to hold this on vent.  The magnets aren't strong but - barely strong enough to hold on the ceiling.There's nothing good to look at with this deflector.  It kind of disappears since it's transparent plastic.If this will fit your vent, just get one.  See how you like it and you can order more later."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The Wrangler spare is held on by three lug nuts, the other holes are covered from the inside by the mount so you can't get this cable thru any of them.  The only way is to drill a hole thru one of the other two holes and thru the mount.  This takes the simplicity out of using this cable lock, obviously.  But if you're willing to do this, it just takes a few extra minutes and then the lock works great on it.  I'll probably also add a locking lug nut to mine for added theft deterrence.  A cable lock isn't foolproof but it gives you another level and at this price why not?"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "man it's hard to come up with a title for this. and it's a mixed reviewIt works.  It's metal, strong, rust-resistance (it's not a grade of rust-proof stainless as there are already spots from road-salt), but given the narrow space where it fits, it's difficult to get the locking end on and off.  It's hard to get a good grip on it,  even with the knurling on the ends.  But the ends ARE small enough so there's no interference with other hardware.  The hitch on my truck is just wide enough outside that there's almost to end-play on the lock shaft which makes getting the end on even more difficult.  Takes some getting used to.  I don't think there's a better product out there though, which makes this worth the price."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I really appreciate the Rain X in a light drizzle or mist, when the water seems to disperse by itself with minimal windshield wiper use. When you apply before the cold weather, though, it helps prevent ice from sticking to your windshield, which is just great. I also like to use the product on the back window, which doesn't have a wiper, because it keeps the window clearer. Follow the directions--let it dry to a light haze and wipe it off with a microfiber or paper towel until the windshield is clear. I'm sure you'll like it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is the original product.  Really great stuff.  Works so well; when rain hits, you'll be so happy you applied it.  Rain just sheets off; you don't even need wipers on.This package includes a LOT of product.  A huge improvement from the small, single-use packages they used to make (or maybe they still do); this is a much better value.The only downside to this product is the seal; there's a little spout on the bottle top that goes up and down; you flip it up to dispense the product.  It seems pretty flimsy, and doesn't seem to seal very well when closed.  I have a feeling some of it is going to evaporate out of the bottle, and at some point some will spill out if the bottle is ever turned on its side.  Other than that, great product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product takes time to put on right but it is worth the effort.  When you are done you will not believe the results when you get into a rain storm.  Your windshield glass is so slick that the heaviest rain just slides right off without using your wipers.  Your visibility is improved dramatically and you can see what is going on around you.I use it often but especially when I am going on a long vacation drive.  It improves your driving safety in inclement weather and helps to keep your family and you safer. I use it on the outside of all of my windows of my vehicles.  It is good for rain, sleet and snow and even reduces the amount of bugs that will stick to your windows.  The treatment lasts for about 3 months.  It is only recommended for glass.The further you can see the better your response time to stop in case of an emergency.  I strongly recommend this product as doing a great job!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This thing is smaller and skinnier than I thought, although it is very long.  It is awkward for filling my car engine oil because its so long that the bottom of the funnel hits the valve heads before anything else, so its unstable to just sit in there.  I have to hold it to support it with one hand while i fill the oil with the other.It does have some good uses though, as it is just the right size to fill my motorcycle transmission oil.All in all, the funnel is solid, no complaints on the product quality, but I think next time I will purchase in person so I can really gauge the size I need."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "What's to say?  It's not very large.  It works perfect in my 2003 Chevy truck to add a Fuel Additive into the fuel tank!!!  It should work for Power steering and transmission also, at least on Car/trucks that's not hard to get to or down load were access is bad.  The design helps keep you from spilling when your poring a fluid into it!  For under $5, not a bad deal.  Hang it up out of the way when done with it.  It's able to fit into your Transmission Dip Stick tube, so it has to be small enough, so you can just dump a bunch a fluid into it at once!!!  It's small and doesn't hold all that much.  For what it is, I like it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I love this funnel, it has so many uses. For example I can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease. I can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until I need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again. Let's see a hammer do either of those things. My hammer never stays put. You can reason with this funnel, it has an open mind so to speak. Others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I got sick of using my &#34;Common&#34; funnel for different uses, trying to clean up an oily funnel so you can use it for Sea Foam is just dumb when you can get these for a little more than $1.  The size/length is perfect for gas-tank additives.  I purchased 3, I keep one in the garage to pour Sea Foam into my cara/motorcycle/snow-blower/lawnmower.  And the other 2 I keep in whatever vehicle I'm currently using, in my &#34;just in case&#34; pack.Great product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Bought this along with a No Spill 5 gallon can to use for track days. THe length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car. It also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. Two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1) It should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2) The diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size - would allow faster filling."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product works extremely well and is extremely reliable. Anyone complaining about the short cord didn't do their homework. The pictures clearly illustrate a short cord. A 12 foot cord would be ridiculous on a car mountable charger. I like to use those 9 inch lighted extension cords sold atwalmart and Amazon.com, These give you a lighted indication of power when plugged in. My charger is under hood mounted and has seen over 110 degreeswhile running highway speeds and charging in summer heat. Frankly I'm amazed it still works 5 years later. I will buy another if it quits working."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Auto battery life can be significantly lengthened with the use of a trickle charger. Significantly. I put this one into my 4X4 to keep my Interstate battery at maximum readiness. This is a solid heavy duty device and is no toy. I mounted it securely under the hood next to the battery itself and have a heavy duty plug hanging down -- just behind the front bumper -- to connect up while out in the driveway. The lights/indicators on this model are very nice and it keeps my battery at full strength. If you have two vehicles (or more) and you don't drive one of them that often -- definitely get one of these. You will never have another \"oh no\" moment -- when turning that key in the morning. Highly recommended."}

The cap will not stay on to protect the key entry slot. Any little bump in the road, and off it comes !  Dirt and water gets into the lock mechanism, the key will not go in and you will not get it off with out a cutting torch."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I was looking for a new chamois to replace the old worn out one I had.  I ran across the Absorber, and the reviews wore great on this product.  So, I decided to give it a try.  I'm SO glad I bought it!! It really is the best chamois/absorbent drying towel I've ever seen!! After drying your car (or whatever you are trying to dry off), just toss it in your washing machine. It comes out looking brand new again!!  You really can go wrong---buy this product!!!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I find it a bit humorous that reviewers keep saying &#34;it doesn't absorb water&#34;.. then they state later on that they have to ring all of the water out all of the time. Are they ringing out &#34;air&#34; ? Of course is absorbs the water. It is just not good at drying the car for the final wipe. I use a towel after using this. That's worked well for many years. I tried a &#34;waffle towel&#34; and it was worse than the absorber. I tried a special auto towel, but that did not work as well either. I think that the absorber used with a towel is probably the best combo to use. I suppose you can turn on the leaf blower, but if you get any dirt in there you may do a number on your paint."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Pros:- works better than chamois in absorbing water.- does not produce streaks when drying cars  - Spot free!- I cut it to half and quarter sizes - makes it great for the kitchen tops, sink and bathroom- works great for kitchen spills- available almost everywhere- cheaper than chamoisCons:-You have to store it moist in the canister or it will dry stiff as a cardboard. (Dip it on water and it is good to go again).-Storing it moist promotes growth of bacteria and micro-organism. Forget about using it on your body as a towel or drying your plates, pots and utensils."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I find it much easier to use this chamois over a towel while drying a car.  The absorber works well with soaking up water then with a quick squeeze your back at drying.  The chamois does not leave cloth and lint on your car like towels and old shirts.  I also use a damp chamois to wipe down the interior dash and seats of my vehicle, which works very well.  I would also recommend a soft water blade to use first after rinsing your vehicle to do the large areas and windows...then go back over it with the chamois.  It will cut your car drying time in half and work x2 as good. You are supposed to keep the chamois damp so when I am done I just put it back in the case and it will stay damp until my cars next wash.  It is supposed to extend the life of the chamois."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this cloth with the intent of drying my car after I have washed it. I have very hard water and when I want my car to look nice I have to dry it or I get little hard water spots all over the place.Drying my car with \"The Absorber\" does solve that problem and it does absorb quite a lot of water. It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in. I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water. But it dries to the point where the residual water evaporates in a minute or so. I consider that pretty good and my goal of not having water spots is met so I'm a happy camper. I would buy another one if I needed it :)"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this for a while. Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did. One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that wont give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have to admit that there is a small  improvement in performance. The throttle response is better but not to the point to say that there is a increase in horse power. The truck seems to run a little better and I hope it's just not the change in summer fuels. I wasn't looking for fuel improvement. All I was looking for was better drivability and I think that's what I got. I only have one concern and that is that it doesn't affect the mass air flow sensor ( MAF ) because of the oil that is use on the filter could possibly damage it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "First, this filter will NOT give you huge horsepower gains, it might give you minimal MPG gains just by replacing the filter from a dirty, clogged one, but that will come with any filter. I bought this filter because it does save money, money you would be spending buying paper filters over and over again, with this and a 10-15 dollar service kit, this filter will last your vehicles lifetime. There is a trade off though, this filter does not screen out dirt as well as say a \"paper\" or foam type filter, that is why \"off roading\" voids the damage warranty. however i never off road, and for highway and street use, this filter is King in terms of economy and durability (it is made of 4-5 layers of cotton encased with a aluminum wire mesh surrounded by hand poured urethane), they mean it when they say it will last a Million miles. This filter earns my recommendation."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "so i used this to basically pressure wash my muddy ATV. it worked surprisingly well. nothing like a pressure washer but just turn on water and use this and i got 90% of it off. i had hoped for a little more power on the high pressure setting but cant really expect much i guess.i dont know how often ill use it, maybe for playing with my son, but i like the &#34;gentle soak&#34; spray. its much wider and useful than just the hose without a nozzlei would say the best 2 features are 1. the ability to shut it off going either direction and 2. even if its not much more powerful than your typical nozzle there is no holding a handle, or holding your finger over the hose to get pressure. feels like it should last a long time"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I didn't like this hose nozzle as much as other reviewers.  For the price, I was expecting an amazing nozzle.  It is heavy, sturdy, and looks like it will be very durable, but I do not like the selection of the spray patterns compared to the $5 hose nozzles at home improvement stores.  The rubber areas are comfortable to hang on to.This would be great for washing a car or big jobs like hosing down a pool or screens, but for watering potted plants and trees, this nozzle puts too much water down and creates splashing."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have owned no less than 15 different nozzles over the years. One has been worse than the next. The ones you drop after you use which are made of plastic simply break. Then there are the ones with the several settings and trigger which constrict the flow so much that you would think it needed a dose of flomax! I have used many types in between. This unit is simply the best. I never realized the pressure I had restricted by using the other ones. When I turned the spigot on all the way, I could get a good steady stream over 20 feet no problem at all. I drop it after use without worrying about cracking it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I liked the concept of this, and bought two at the same time. We have small ranch, and varying watering/hosing needs. We typically buy the 7 way adjustable nozzles, but I thought these would allow more versatility.These nozzles perform well, but not as good as a conventional nozzle. For a start, there is no quick way to get the desired spray pattern, you have to slowly rotate the head and stop when you think it is what you need, often messing around 'finely tuning' it to try and get the best result. Secondly, none of the 'jet' part of the adjustments creates a clean jet, there is always a fine mist or errant second or third jet spraying in a different direction at the same time.These cannot create all the spray patterns found on a 7 way nozzle, and create poor patterns on the ones they can create.This is a good idea, but in reality you are better off with a 7 way nozzle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "You are better off going to your local department store and buying the Craftsman brand nozzle instead. It is identical to this one except the green part is silver. And it comes with a lifetime replacement guarantee unlike this Bon-Aire one. It's also about the same price.That said, I prefer a trigger type nozzle because to turn this off, you have to rotate it several revolutions and then it doesn't remember the spray setting you were at. This type of nozzle may be good if you're holding it for a long period of time watering your garden or something like that, but for washing your car when you only turn the water on periodically, it doesn't work as well as a trigger type hose nozzle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This has a lot of uses beyond car applications. I used a sheet of it on the drywall behind in-wall speakers to cut the amount of sound radiating through the back wall and tighten the sound. I used a sheet of it inside a computer case, to eliminate a tinny rattle that came from the case vibration while it was on. You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter.It does have one drawback, and that's the fact that once you stick it on something, you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess. It is essentially tar with a foil outer cover, and trying to get it off just leaves a bunch of sticky tar behind. So, choose the place you want it carefully before sticking it down!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have used Dynamat to combat noise in automobiles, dishwashers and even under a stainless steel kitchen sink.  The dishwasher and the sink were the most dramatic demonstrations of the value of this product.  The dishwasher was on the noisy side, until I had to replace a small switch in the door.  While I had it all apart, I decided to coat the inside of the door panel with Dynamat.  Now the dishwasher makes a soft hum as it running.  The sink was insulated, but it made that cheap rain on a metal roof sound when you turned on the water.  It was difficult to have a conversation and do the dishes at the same time.  Now it is dead quiet!  What a change!  I love this stuff.  I know that I will be on the look out for more Dynamat applications in my life!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I don't even know another sound deadner solution besides dynamat and theres proably a reason for that. I have been using this stuff on many car audio projects for years and its been great. Excellent from stopping trunk paneling from rattling down and solidifying speaker enclosures down to keeping wires bundled neatly and secure to the chassis. Always buy a bulk pack at least because the project always starts small like two speakers enclosures and next your doing the whole door outside panel and inside panel. Plus it never hurts to have extra."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've used Dynamat for many years now. In my car I didn't manage to eliminate rattles from the trunk (2x jl audio 13w6's), but greatly reduced them. It used to be embarrassing (and sounded bad too) driving with volume up and car rattling being the only audible thing. It's better now because the rattling can only be heard by the trunk on the outside. I used it in the doors, floors, and trunk of my 04' elantra and it dramatically reduced road noise. It also made the stereo sound 10x better in my car. I also used it in the doors and trunk of an 01 Grand Prix, and also reduced road noise and improved stereo quality, but not as dramatically as my car since the grand prix comes with more sound deadening."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "As for quality, sure it isn't top notch. But this thing isn't going to fall apart on you, these are tough and will hold. Scared for you life? Than go to a shop. The welding isn't perfect, but you have to realize this is mass produced. The welds aren't going to separate. I would definitely suggest using these in pairs, as in don't leave one alone to hold part of your vehicle. For those with cars, don't worry b/c cars weigh nothing. These are rated for as much as a cars avg weight. The double locking is a nice feature but not necessary on small jobs. My truck weighs over 6k so if these can hold one end, it will hold your average cars then too. If your doing small jobs, get these b/c theres no beating the price."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I would not hesitate to recommend these jack stands, as I have had very good results and they seem to be very well made.  The double lock is an absolutely mandatory feature in my estimation.  You should always use the jack stands with the double lock in place, as it adds additional security.  I am pleased with the height of the stands as well, as it is possible to raise the vehicle up a considerable amount, making it easy to get in and work.  I replaced the front suspension on my vehicle in an afternoon using these stands and they never wavered.  I went out and replaced the rear shocks, springs, and fuel filter the next day.  Once again, the stands were steady and solid while I pushed, shoved, wedged, etc. the rear springs into place.I am very pleased with these stands and definitely recommend them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this to provide extra heat prevention/protection for my short ram intake heat shield. My brand intake is a Neuspeed on my 2012 MKVI Jetta 2.5L SEL.It is easy to shape/trace to the shape of the item being wrapped and easy to cut/place. So far, the heat wrap has lasted and I see no peeling, especially after having lasted through two heavy days of raining. I did a temp-check with remote thermostats and found an additional 67F difference with the heat shield being wrapped versus not. A definite difference and benefit from before -- after! I will post a picture this evening to go along with my review."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Originally, I purchased this for a vehicle engine air intake -- cooler air = more mpg/power.  However, I found that it works well for high temperature halogen lighting fixtures.  In the winter, CFL take too long warm up in a garage door opener.  So, I employ 150 watt halogen lamps.  Even with the translucent fixtures removed, the lamps still melt the dark plastic housing on the garage door opener.  With this heat barrier covering all of the nearby surfaces, not only is the plastic housing protected but better light out is realized."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "it stays stuck, on fiberglass at least.  easily cut to shape.  seems to protect.  i'm using it on the bellypan of my motorcycle track fairing, which is fiberglass.  i'm told fiberglass won't bubble like stock type fairings will, so i may not have needed it.  but i put it on just in case, and whether it's because i didn't need it or the stuff is working, but my paint isn't bubbling.  which is all i care about."}

After getting a new SUV i decided to shop immediately on amazon for a new blind spot mirror and i found this.I decided to try this product based on user review and did the right thing.  These mirrors are perfect for my Outlander 2011 side mirrors.  I like the shape and very clear mirrors.  Although i should have gotten the 3x3 but still this 2x2 works.  Just make sure you purchase 2.  Since this is not sold in pair...  I had this mistake thinking it was sold in pair.. good think i got Amazon prime :"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I started out with the \"kit\" (cleaner & oil) for my K&N.  It just seems that the oil lasted longer than the cleaner, especially if your filters get really dirty and you have to clean a second time.  The 32 oz. may cost as much as the kit, but it also has 4x the amount of cleaner in the spay bottle.  The larger spray bottle has a larger dispersal sprayer than the one in the kit, so it takes less time to spray down your filter."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Washed the filter on a Friday evening and the filter was dry Saturday evening.  Sprayed on the oil on Sunday afternoon.  Very easy to do on a 2008 GMC Sierra 3500 HD Diesel.  My main concern with the dealer doing it was that they might not have let the filter dry completely before re-oiling it.  How would I have ever known if it were done correctly?  They said it would take about an hour.  I don't know how the filter could have ever dried &#34;naturally&#34; as is required by K&N, in only one hour.  I'm glad I did it myself and I bet you will be too.  This kit will probably last for at least three recharges."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have a K&N; filter on my G35's cold air intake as well as on my truck, and have always use this to clean and re-oil it.It really works well. The cleaning solution really breaks down the oil allowing it to be rinsed off fairly easily and t he aerosol can makes re-oiling a breeze.The only issue I have is I ALWAYS run out of cleaning solution before I run out of the air filter oil. Granted, this may be a good thing as it prevents you from finishing cleaning off your filter then realizing you have no oil to re-oil it, which would leave you in a tight spot if you need your car to work and you can't get more filter oil quickly.So, even though I complain about that, it's really being picky."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Some of the other reviewers here prefer the aerosol, but I think the squeeze bottle is just fine for re-oiling a cleaned filter.  I don't know what everyone is complaining about.  This is something that's good to do while you have some yardwork or some reason to be outside since the filter needs to sit for about 15-20 minutes during the cleaning/oiling process.In the long run, if you keep your car long enough, one K&N; filter is cheaper than all of those disposables."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "K&N; Filter Care Service Kit - Squeeze BottleI bought the squeeze bottle version of the kit because I had heard the aerosol spray was difficult to meter accurately. I'm here to say that the squeeze bottle isn't a perfect solution either. I had to oil the Ducati Performance air filter for my 696, which is just a basic cylindrical filter except the \"dirty\" air comes in from the inside out. A typical conical filter on a car has the dirt collecting on the outside. The airbox on the 696 is set up so the dirt comes from the inside of the filter. This made it extremely difficult to oil properly.On a car filter, oiling the pleats evenly takes a lot of time and excess oil still tends to seep out. It takes some practice, time, and patience - probably a second filter doesn't hurt either.Overall: 4/5 stars, still difficult to oil the filter uniformly but easier to control versus the aerosol spray"}

I installed this to have a lower, and hopefully louder tone in my horn. The factory horn was lower though. I realize this is probably more for motorcycles now, so on an Isuzu Trooper, it is a little pathetic. I blame this on myself though, and I realize the product is good for its intended audience. Just don't buy this if you havea  truck! The look of this horn, if you have it visible, is a plus, and the shipping and installation were a breeze."}

Then I saw a CJ with the old style ( there were aged ) the KC was smaller and the guards were holding up well after the years of use it was obvious they had."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Woo-hoo!  I love these things.  I put two on my 2004 trailer, and am really glad I did!  Really makes coming down stairs a whole lot more secure.  These are super simple to install, with just four screws total.  And, they fold in either direction when towing, meaning that if you've got an awning assembly near your door, you can fold these closed over the door(s)! And, they make your rig look like a movie star trailer (no fooling, someone said that to me)!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this based on the reviews. Though it seems to condition the leather, it didn't really seem to buff up the finish and restore my leather to its' original, or near new condition. After cleaning all the floors in my home, and all of my car's leather interior, I followed the directions on the package for conditioning and protecting the leather seats in my car.  While it does make the leather more supple and soft, it doesn't buff up to a shine, or even satin finish, Instead, it seems to leave a dull, chalky finish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this with the leather cleaner. I found it to be very good, but you have to wait for it to dry, which takes about a day. It does not stay as tacky as the leather honey conditioner which I also have bought. I feel the honey conditioner will be better in the long run, but if the leather is delicate the honey could potentially make it worse because it is very sticky and can wear the material as you rub it in. So in the long run, this is a great option."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you have leather seats in your car, this is the stuff you want to use on them. It gives them a silky smooth feel and a nice luster. Easy to apply too. No overwhelming odor like some leather products either. To me it makes my seats smell the way they did when they were new, so I guess the best description would be &#34;new car smell&#34;. As far as using it on any other leather items, I'm sure it would work great, but you'd have to take into account the car smell. Not sure you'd want your leather coat smelling like a car. :)My only negative quibble is the size of the bottle. It's huge. It will last for years. It would be nice if they offered it in a smaller size. (They might have one, but I couldn't find it.)"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Yes. It smells kinda funny. Yeah, if you leave it sitting long enough, you'll have these fatty looking clumps in the liquid. No, they don't disappear after shaking. And still, after all those years, that bottle of Lexol conditioner still worked great on my MDX's leather. Between the Lexol cleaner and this conditioner, the 10 year old car's leather already looked newer. It can't save the glazing the driver's seat acquired from use, but all the other seats did manage to look like that brand new leather look; slightly matte, firm, but supple.For the price, I think Lexol conditioner's great. Leatherique's conditioner is quite a bit more expensive."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I mainly got this product for my leather jacket that I haven&#8217;t used in a few years and looked faded and felt stiff. It was so stiff it started to warp and bend that I got worried it would stay that way or get ruined.When applying I used a terry sponge bonnet and as I applied the conditioner to the black jacket inside lining (testing) it first came on really wet. I got a little worried but let it sit for two minutes and eventually the leather absorbed it. Before I had applied the conditioner my jacket had a faded almost ashy black and after applying the product it brought out a nice deep rich color and think it looks better than when I first bought it. Plan on using this product on all my leather items."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this conditioner last year for my leather furniture and have been very happy with the results.  It does need to be applied every few months, but I've used it on a variety of leather surfaces (worn leather sofa, dining room chairs with leather padding, office chair) with excellent results.  As long as you don't apply it too thick, it won't leave an oily residue, and it blends into the leather very nicely.  I've gone through the original bottle and a refill, and am about to order another refill.For application, the Lexol sponges work great.  They can be rinsed and reused and last a long time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I read with interest many of the other reviews.  It seems everyone but myself has heard of this brand.  I have been using car leather conditioner bought at the parts store on my truck seats, a couch, and two recliners.The car conditioner worked ok but was expensive and harder to apply.This just floats on with a small cloth.........I put in on rather heavy since my leather had not been treated for over 6 months.The difference was amazing.  My leather returned to it's new look and after a week I see no evidence of the smooth leather glow going away."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "We tried Lexol in a vehicle leather seating application favoring its price over the more expensive URAD product. The Lexol didn't seem to have as much lanolin as the URAD, and we don't know if there is any carnauba wax in the Lexol product but we noted there was less post-application sheen with the Lexol product.If you can stand the higher price, try the URAD product at least once. If you're a long-time hard-core Lexol user, stay with it - it seems to work OK. You really can't get too worked abut leather conditioners/polishes can you?!?!  (But we prefer URAD having tried both)"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I got this Lexol Leather pH Cleaner Spray offline at a local auto parts store...and I am glad I did.I start cleaning my car and the first thing I notice is the citrus smell.

At this point the white cleaning rag I was using was still white and given I had not cleaned the seats in months I just returned it.So I went online and after much research orderedGriot's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kit.  Well, the Griot cleaner cleaned old grime of the leather seats I had cleaned with the Lexol cleaner a week earlier.I have used a variety of leather cleaners over the years and in my experience this one does absolutely nothing."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "A relatively thick, viscous liquid that cleans leather like crazy.  You only need just a bit on a wet rag, then it's off to the races cleaning your leather.  I use this on a leather couch, auto upholstery, shoes, boots and a leather jacket.It only cleans, but it does that well.  For protection you'll need something like Lexol Leather Conditioner (furniture, auto, jacket) or Nikwax (shoes and boots).A little goes a LONG way, doesn't take much to get the cleaning done.  One bottle has lasted me several years."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you are underneath your car doing some work, or just doing some routine maintenance, you need a solid pair of stands and a good jack to safely lift your car.  I cannot believe how many people I have seen working on their car with a scissor jack that came as part of their vehicle maintenance pack.  If you value your life, you want to get yourself a nice sturdy pair of stands like these.  It takes no more than a minute to successfully jack up your car, align these jackstands up, and then lower the car back down onto them.  They are built VERY nicely and the capacity is more than enough for standard vehicles (I use them on my RX8).  The only thing I wish that it had was some sort of safety on the release.  Granted that when the weight of the car is on the stands it is near impossible to release the height, it would still be a nice bit of insurance."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have had no problems using these and they work as described.  I do not like, though, that you have to hammer in the retaining tab to prevent the platform arms from coming out.  I also do not see how these are really double locking.  I wish they came with a adapter for the saddle since the saddle area is pretty big, but I knew that these weren't completely flat saddles (I made an adapter).  I would recommend them, but know what you are getting before you pull the trigger on getting them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have used a LOT of this type of equipment over the past 30+ years and this is one of the best for the price deals I have found.  I sure wish they were tad bit longer, but what can one expect?  They have a good strong cast wire and plug assembly (as pictured) and they used a very good quality wire of what looks to be at least an 18 ga wire, with good flexibility.  The alligator clips use a high quality end and should give a good long service life if not abused.  With a 3 foot lead length I assume they are designed mostly for use as a bench test lead set, but these will service any use where a 3 foot length will do the job.  Buy with confidence.... so far, I have never had a bad experience with anything from Elenco!  Not to mention that Amazon's policies will cover you if you are not satisfied..... highly likely you will NOT be disappointed.  Enjoy!"}

If you sit it on the shelf after opening it and using it most likely by the time you need it again it'll be hard. I only needed for a couple spots on the car, one where a tree length fell on it, and this product is perfect. Goes on easily, dries hard and is easy to sand. Saves you money from having to buy a large tub.Highly recommended."}

Better then the dealership's 700 dollar application of Xylon on my wife's' 2014 Honda Odyssey. Make sure you clean your vehicle with the pre cleaner and do a hand check to feel for &#34;bumps&#34; of dirt or other road grim before application.

If neurotic about replacement or don't knowdate of last replacement, replace right away or after somelesser interval like 20,000 miles.

Even my girlfriend felt the car running better (without knowing that I had done anything to the car). I would recommend to any body who feels there car isn`t as peppy as before its really worth trying, just use as recommended. Even do I only used it via brake booster and gas tank didn`t use it in the crankcase. Still great!!!"}

Not only did I take good care of it, constantly clean it, and always use premium fuel, but I would use Sea Foam from time to time. A lot of engine cleaners are similar, but Sea Foam has been around for a long time and seems to be one the strongest and most reliable brands. And at around 8-12 dollars a can (depending on where you buy from), its totally worth it for me to use every now and then.Also, don't just pour it into the fuel and oil tanks. Thats great for regular maintenance every 1k miles or so, but either find out, have a friend, or figure out (youtube) where the brake booster vacuum line is that runs to your engine. Running Sea Foam through that is what its known for and will reeeallllllly clean out your engine."}

I placed the treatment in the oil crankcase and in the gas tank as well.  An added feature is that it comes with a spill free spout but I still recommend a long funnel.Cons: a bit pricey when compared to it's competitors but we're only talking a few dollars."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been using this product for years, and it's the best out there. It is low gloss, and a little goes a LONG way. I use this on more than just my car. Basically anything made of plastic that I need to condition and protect, I apply this product to. In my opinion, the other major competitor that \"armors everything\" doesn't live up to the hype, and in fact can in some cases cause you more headaches than save you. Plus, it's gone up in price quite a bit. Pay a little more and buy a better product. The Lexol leather conditioner is also an excellent product, made by the same company. I will add that I prefer the spray bottles to the wipes for both."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this for years on my car dash and other vinyl areas of the interior. I always thought it worked and protected pretty well although it does evaporate on to the inside of the windshield, which is annoying. It also doesn't seem to last very long and as it starts wearing off, the dash looks very dry.I've since found303 Aerospace Protectant 32oz, and that works much better. It doesn't seem to exhibit any of the aforementioned issues, ie., it doesn't seem to go on to the inside of the windshield, and the shine lasts longer.  It also protects from UV just as well, if not better.  Note that Vinylex contains silicone, which actually damages the vinyl/plastic over time.I'm definitely sold on 303 Protectant over Vinylex now although I really like the Lexol pH leather cleaner and Lexol leather conditioner for my leather."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This made my brake flush just as easy as an oil change. Fill it up, tighten everything up (really tight, more on that later) pressurize and open caliper bleed nipples one by one.Couple nit-picks:1: Tough to tell when you are running out of fluid in the resivoir. The pressure bottle is a thick plastic that's barely translucent. Nearly pumped air through the entire brake system at the end because I couldn't tell the pressurizer was dry of fresh fluid.2: They really need to ship with a roll of teflon plumbers tape. The connection between the hose and the adapter leaked for me, and I had it tight as could be.Overall a must have for DIY brake jobs. Couple things hold it back from being a 5-star product."}

What's great is just rub on and buff off in 15 min., and you use only a capful per 3 sq/ft.  Water beads up and rolls off, or gets blown off while driving(water flies off the windshield). Between waxing, add a capful to bucket of clean water and wash your car. MUST dry car immediately with microfiber cloths so no spots will form.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Great shipping by AMAZON and VENDOR."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I gave this 4 stars because it is a great, gentle, all in one protectant.  It performs as promised.  Would not hesitate to get it.  One thing for sure.....  If you want a 5 STAR product, get the KLASSE Sealant/Protectant in the Silver jug.  It is fantastic, and if I was only going to get ONE KLASSE product, it would be the Sealant just mentioned.  The silver bottle!  Red bottle comes in at one step behind.  But both are good."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I mounted these behind the front grill whereas the original single horn was in the engine compartment.  It is an improvement on the sound level but not as much as I expected.  I did use the provided relay and ran 12 gauge wiring (original was somewhere between 14-16 gauge) that did not rely on the original horn wiring.The horns are well made and I expect them to last the life of the vehicle.  I only gave them 3 stars though because the sound is not the ear splitting &#34;wake up and pay attention to what you are doing&#34; volume that I was expecting.  So even though I will keep them I will probably be looking for something that is even louder."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The relay setup is a breeze, if you want to make things easy just connect the aux plug directly to the power plug & horn will work at all times, rather than just when the car is on. You CANNOT take the bolt off on the back, dont try to, the covers can be removed and painted with ease by removing the black screws around the bezel. Also, we cut & drilled a new hole on the bracket to place them where we wanted them & that bracket is made of reinforced Steele & took forever to drill through. Excellent product"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this to replace a replacement cover. The old replacement cover was old, ripped and still smelled like the strong vinyl scent. This one is very nice. It is nice and smooth and feels good in your hands. It takes some muscle to install but once it is one there it looks good. It could be a tad cheaper but it looks well made. The stitching is solid and doesn't seem like it will come apart. It doesn't move at all once you place it on your steering wheel so you don't have to worry about that."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred. These covers fit well. They don't slide and they are made of real leather. You can smell the leather scent. One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather, they do make the driving experience slightly different. They do make the steering wheel thicker. No regrets, the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition. The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I'm always hesitant to use tire-shine for personal reasons.  They always wear-off and sometimes they are just too shiny.This spray really does the job.  Its non-greasy and shiny.  It makes tires to look BLACK (the fluid is white/cloudy) and as i was applying it to the tires, i could see a difference.  It rained right after i left the carwash and after driving in the rain for 15mins the shine/cleanliness was still there.  So over all i'm super happy with this."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I was at our Good-Guys car show (with my show car) a few years ago and a (NAPA) dealer had this product for sale. They said try it and if you don't like it bring it right back and I'll give your money back. Well...I didn't and I have continued to use this for years since. This stuff is great and like others have stated really brings the new tire look without being too shiny. I used it on all the plastic and rubber parts to bring new life look back and also the colored plastic panels can bring the color back. None of it is permanent and tires need to be re done every other wash or so. I use the 'Eagle One Tire Swipe' applicator to apply the product or wipe it around for an even appearance. I have even used it sparingly on my Azek deck and keeps it looking sharp (but if too much can get slippery). Great product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My preference was to purchase a grease gun made in the USA. Nowhere could I find one so I was resigned to buy one which I was sure would be made in China. To my surprise the gun was made in India and is a high quality item. The hose was made in Germany which was another surprise. I needed to lubricate the spindles on my mower so I obtained a grease cartridge and tried to load it into the gun by following the manual provided by Lincoln. I appreciate the fact that Lincoln furnished a manual but I would have been pleased if it had been written clearly enough to be understood. I simply could not load the cartridge using the Lincoln manual and decided to look for other instructions. Luckily I found a YouTube clip titled Lincoln Grease Gun Tutorial which solved my loading problem and offered other helpful hints. All went well after viewing that clip.This is a fine grease gun and works as expected. Other than a confusing user guide I have no complaints."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless. The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Can't say anything bad about the gun -- well constructed and built to last a lifetime. However, I see what people are talking about with the instructions. They're not really instructions. No parts labeled, nothing but a drawing of the unit itself, and another small diagram showing the spring release pulled back and locked. Other than that, the instructions literally consist of one 107-word run-on sentence that leaves you scratching your head. So just don't even read it, just throw it in the trash unless you want to laugh."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "There are many types of clay out there but this works great on a newer vehicle or one that only needs to be dressed up a bit. Easy to work with and requires little effort. I use a spray lube and have found Mequiars Final Inspection does the job.Make sure the surface is washed before starting.Unless you drop some or have other issues, one bar will be enough for most vehicles. I've been able to do 3 small cars with one of these bars.You could shop all over and play hit or miss for a couple bucks or just do it right the first time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Maybe its just me, but I didn't see much difference.  I have a 2010 370Z that I baby, and decided after three years it might be time to detail the finish.  As I said, I baby the darn thing so its garage kept and pretty clean to start with.  I followed the long, involved instructions written by one of the experienced reviewers to the letter. I decided to just do the hood, and then clean/wax the rest of the car for comparison. .  I could see some different in the hood.  It was definitely a higher gloss.  But not a difference that any one else would notice.  Maybe it would be more noticeable in an older car with faded paint.  But I wouldn't waste time doing this again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "First of all, THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A MOUNTING BRACKET! For the first time ever, I didn't read reviews here before purchasing and bought a separate mounting bracket which Amazon lists as \"frequently purchased together\". On the flip side though, I doubled up the brackets to make them a bit more sturdy. The bracket will bend backwards from the force of pushing the 7 pin plug in otherwise.The adapter itself is made of a thick plastic so corrosion shouldn't be an issue. Both covers work well and should keep out the elements though dielectric grease should be used as well. The wires are heavy (enough) gauge and have good jackets to them and the included crimp connectors are a nice bonus, though I always recommend soldering them.My only complaint is the cheap screws that come with it. Everything needed to mount it is included but it's very soft steel and strips with little effort. Do yourself a favor and pick up some nice stainless screws at least for where it mounts to the vehicle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "what I needed was rewireable or pigtail 2-pin connectors but those don't seem easy to find. maybe if there was an RV store near me, but...but honestly finding this was even better. and the price is unbelievable.(what I really needed these for, is to cut in half and reverse the polarity. yeah, I know, danger will robinson. but it turns out that chaining up certain other connectors on my solar system results in wrong polarity in the first place, so to fix that... yeah, it scares me too.)"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I needed to extend the length of the reach of the charge controller in my solar panel system setting, and after checking the prices of the extensions for sale, I decided to make my own.I bought these to cut in half and use at the end of the wires. These work so good that soon I'll be ordering more, because I'm planning to build a battery bank, and using these will lower the cost for sure.Also, they are easy and secure to disconnect and reconnect to the different component within the solar panel system setting."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Works well as a way to adapt our car's 7 blade trailer hookup to also work on our 4 wire bicycle trailer. The LEDs are particularly appreciated, as a way of ensuring proper functioning of trailer lighting to at least that point. The rubber cover for the 4 contacts is also much appreciated.Our lawn mower once ran over this, damaging it enough that we bought another, though the original does still work - despite no longer being quite all there.My only other suggetion is that it's not always obvious in the dark which side goes up, though it does eventually only fit one way.Recommended!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out, and so does this Adapter. But I really wouldn't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well, with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector, aligning all the pins correctly. It's a tight fit so that it won't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I don't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested.  Frankly, I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway, with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works.  I presume the LEDs will tell me if there's an issue some day."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I try to avoid doing rear brake jobs with drums as best a possible....LOLSo to that end, i have only used this tool a few times.It's effectiveness really depends on the design of the brake job you're doing.  But it's been really good so far for me.Doing rear brakes is like going to battle.  Every fight is going to be different so you have to find the right &#34;Weapon&#34; to do battle with.  Not Like doing caliper brakes.  What do you use???  Sockets and wrenches and DONE!!!!  With rear brakes it feels like you will use anything you can find that will help you win the battle.  LOL!!!!you just have to becareful not to bend the springs when using this tool cause it can happen really easily.It's very handy to have in your arsenal of tools."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Sure you can use a C clamp or a adjustable wrench but this isn't very expensive and looks to be of reasonable construction. My only issue is I have everything to install brakes but I've been waiting for almost 3 weeks for a floor jack to ship and I'll be damned if I'm breaking out the jack out of my trunk when quality floor jack is on order. Ok finally used this tool and all I can say is Perfect! Works just as it should, I tightened in small slow increments and let the piston settle all the way back. Made adding the pads a dream, now if there was a way to keep the freak'n pads in place till you slide the caliper back in place ! lol"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I own my own detailing business and use this product exclusively for three purposes.  1. As a clay lubricant for paint contamination removal and 2. Putting the finishing touch on vehicles that are freshly painted and/or have had recent body work.  I love the fact that it's body shop safe, and 3. Prepping my polishing pads.  Otherwise, for anything else I use Meguiars synthetic spray detailer that wipes off even easier and has the added benefit of putting a protective \"film\" over the vehicle.  Another great product by Meguiars."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Had my 13 yr old car painted and the  body shop said no waxing for 90 days to let the paint out gas. I live in FL with bug season and water spots from washing and general dirt abound. Called Meguries and this stuff is body shop safe. Which means it will let the new paint out gas. I have been using it with excellent results between washes. Once the 90- days are up I will use a permeate wax.For really tough bug stains I use DP Detailers road kill bug remover and then the final inspection to bring the shine back. On very light bug splats the Final inspection works fine."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff works pretty well at removing light swirls and scratches.  They take seconds to get in your clearcoat and hours to remove if done properly.There were some deep defects that were diminished but I didnt want to burn through the clear as I have not done paint repair before.  This is the Pro version of Swirlx and I tried them side by side and this works better than Swirlx.  Maybe its the placebo effect but most of the swirls are gone without any damage to the paint using a cheap Harbor freight DA polisher and their orange compounding pad.  I did follow this up with Ultimate polish then Mirror glaze for a really good black finish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I ordered this stethoscope over the other brands on Amazon because of its higher reviews.  I had also read that other scopes were painful in people's ears.  The quality of this scope is as expected, but the earpieces are painful to wear for more than a few seconds.  That made it difficult for me when I was hunting for a noise in the front end of my car and had to test multiple places.  For quality, I like the scope.  For comfort, I do not.  Ultimately, I'd seek an alternate scope (for comfort reasons) if I were in the market for this product again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I am working on my own truck and am not a mechanic.  I have not used the pump on the truck, yet, but just tested the pump for functions and leaks.This pump has 2 functions: vacuum and pressure, which are selected with a knob on the side.  The pressure release valve has a large handle, but this makes it easy to accidentally release the pressure.  The gauge swivels, so the gauge must be fitted with an o ring.  It comes with a nice case and all the little parts has their own places.For both vacuum and pressure, nothing leaked for at least 20 minutes.For about $72.00, Mityvac beats the Lisle vacuum pump (single function and came with broken pressure release valve) handily.Even though it will be extra expense, I plan to look for a bigger container for draining brake fluid.  I bought a rubber cork stopper to see if I can make my own air tight container."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Great all around product with strong uv protection especially important here in Florida. Used another product that really screwed up my dash  board. This fixed it right up and does not leave a shinny surface that is going to reflect in your windshield. I would describe the finish it leaves as satin. I would suggest spraying it on a cloth when doing your dash board so as not to get it on the inside of the windshield. If you just want to use one product for all your rubber and vinyl this is it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This works on everything!!! But its awesome!! haha i personally do alot of oil changes for the family and alot of my friends have borrowed and used this too, and we love it! Some oil filters are a bit small for this wrench, but it works really well on medium sized oil filters. Before the ownership of this oil filter wrench, i had so many cases where the oil filter literally just melted shut onto the thread. When i was young, i knew no better, so i would take a screw driver and stab it through one side then to the other and use the screwdriver for increase of torque! hahaha It was tough... a bit funny, and really really messy. but now i never have to deal with that again. Until this breaks of course. So far so good though!!!Great buy!!!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "When I first got it, the wrench did work, however, it was never that easy to use due to needing to be flared out first to fit over the filter.  At some point, I lost the spring (not sure why it could even detatch) and then it was rendered completely useless.  Ended up buying a couple of the large socket looking ones that come in three sizes to fit common filters.  They're a bit cheaper, but I had to buy multiple so they end up costing more.  But, they also work, easily, every time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This tool surprised me.  It is made extremely well, I can't over-state this.  This will fit 99.9% of all oil filters, and there is no struggling with other types of tools/wrenches.  It has a spring mechanism where you simply put a ratchet on this and it self fits to any size filter.. and you twist.  Great grip,.. best wrench I've ever used and being universal mean you never need to swap out for another for any other vehicles/tractors, etc.  This replaces a dozen other tools."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This item is primarily used for REMOVAL, not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand. The half-circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn. The tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer. Each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes.  I used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle. I probably won't have to use it ever again. In 40 years of DIY oil changes across a couple dozen different cars, I've never had a leak by simply hand-tightening the canister to the mount."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This fluid evacuator leaks around the top cover, both under vacuum and pressure. After taking the cover off it is apparent that the o-ring seal is too small to make up the gaps in the wavy top surface of the cylinder. I will keep it and make it work, most likely with silicone, but that sort of defeats the fluid dispensing function, as I will not be able to thoroughly clean the container without sealing it up with new silicone each time.The fact that it can be used for pressure or vacuum is good. The pump and associated plumbing works great, just a poor design for the cover seal."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If it works, it works pretty good.  Chances are you will get one with a missing O ring though.  Several people on car forums I am a member of receive defective items including myself.  I called customer service after multiple emails went unanswered.  I told them I think it was missing an o ring because it would not hold a vaccum.  They said \"yep it might be\" and that was it, no \"we will get one right out to you\" or ship it back for an exchange.  They were very rude.  I just sealed it with some gasket maker and it works now but looks terrible.  I would go with a different unit with beter quality control."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After I replaced the old faded headlights on my 2000 Ford CVPI, I noticed that they needed to be adjusted. I called a \"local and official\" state lamp adjusment shop and they quoted me $80 to adjust the two new headlamp assemblies I bought on E-Bay for $50. Right. So I tried to adjust them myself but it was very difficult and time consuming. I bought this tool from a local Napa Auto Parts store. The tool worked OK but unfortunately because the head is so big, it would only turn to a certain extent before being stopped by the other metal piece to the rear of the headlamp assembly unit. Another reviewer below mentioned the same problem. So in the end, the tool was really useless because I could not use it to completely turn the small screws all the way back towards the rear. Ford made such a poor design of their frame that I cannot believe how hard it was to change out my bulbs and headlamp assembly much less adjust them properly."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "And you're probably wondering what happened to the first one... very simple-- someone &#34;acquired it&#34; one fateful day. With that I was in need of getting another pair and after looking at the designs that are out there, I went with the same one that I had. What is nice is that it has a flat that when you crimp down on the ears it helps flatten it out so it is not a big bump. This definitely helps in preventing the clamp from coming apart or becoming misaligned too much while you are squeezing it. There is not much to say except that this one is exactly like my last one and I like the way it works."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "You can't beat these tools in ease of replacing tie rod ends.  I haven't tried the pitman arm puller or the ball joint tool yet, but if they're anything like the tie rod tools, they'll make your life way easier.  Don't mess around with those pickle stabbers, get a real set of tools and make your life easier.  They're beefy enough to work on everything the &#34;home mechanic&#34; can throw at them, and it's really refreshing when you can take a tie rod end off with barely a twist of a wrench.  They come in a nice case too!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this kit to give me the parts to do tie rods and center link on an old MB diesel.  The kit was perfect and the tools were decent.  My main issue and reason for not given five stars is that this is not US-made.  Global economy or whatever, when I'm looking for quality tools, I'm not looking for products from overseas sold at top prices.  Sure, these are better than Harbor Freight, but I doubt the third world labor to make this was much higher than the HF part.But that is a rant to have another day, and I can point you towards a better kit for now.  So this is a great tool set for the DIY mechanic.. But I do hope that OTC brings manufacture to the USA."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this to simply pop the lower ball joint on my 2006 Land Rover LR3 with 70K miles. I couldn't use the venerable pickle fork, so I had to breakdown and buy a front end set. This kit paid for itself in this one job alone. The dealer wanted over $700 for this job; It cost me $200 for parts and $94 for this kit. I used the longest puller for my job and it easily popped off the ball joint with just a couple of cranks with a normal length 1/2 drive breaker bar. The puller didn't even flinch. No warps or bends in the claws.I suspect this kit will serve me for life since I won't be abusing it with a commercial rate of use. I do work on cars more than the average backyard mechanic and I am confident you don't need to drop $400 more on a commercial grade name brand set."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It is apparently well made.  Works as you would expect.  Mine reads between 1 and 2lbs higher than the pressure compared with my racing gauge in the 29lb - 44lb range.  It is marked in 2lb increments but seems to bounce around a bit.  wouldn't count on getting closer than within 2 of your desired pressure with this unit.  It is good for filling past your point, knowing you are there,  then use a more accurate gauge and let air down to the exact pressure you seek.  For lots of uses it will be fine just to go with this tool and accept the +/- 2 lbs or so of error."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is perhaps one of the best air chucks you can buy. True, it isn't cheap and you get what you pay for.Unfortunately though, it does not work 100% on the dualies on my motorhome, which is why I bought it. Turns out, I need the chuck version that has a straight inner tire chuck and angled outer tire chuck. This item has both angled inner and outer chucks.But I can buy a replacement chuck (which Amazon does not sell), or a combination chuck with 12&#34; hose (which Amazon does sell), so I can retrofit the chuck for my type dualie setup.I am giving it 5 stars because I simply ordered the wrong item, so I am not going to gig the product because of that. Amazon though could describe the products a bit better rather than making me go to the vendor's website and looking up the product number to see which one is what I need."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Measured my front and rear tires.  Front 6/32, rear 8/32.  Time to rotate.Accuracy is cleaverly done by putting the numbers around the barrel so accuracy is increased because numbers are spread apart.  Mechanically simple and small to fit in glove commpartment.Can't imagine any advantage to paying more for such a simple tool when this one works so well.  Quality is medium but more than sufficient for this purpose.  Only a few measurements needed for tires.  This tools is the one to buy."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Got this to try to extend the life on my motorcycle tires by adjusting the air to keep the tread depth similar on the middle of the tire and on the sides. It appears I was running too much air and the middle tread was wearing faster than the sides. The gauge is simple and straight forward, however, the scale goes around the cylinder that goes in and out, so if you measure tread depth at one point on the tire, you have to turn the gauge around to read tread depth at another point on the tire if it is more, or less, than the first reading. Also, while you can &#34;guestimate&#34; the depth (good enough for personal use) by reading the lines on the gauge, I would just go for one of the digital depth gauges if I had to buy one again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just want to say thank you to milton for making a METAL tread depth gauge. I hate those little plastic ones. The best part about it is the numbers on the gauge are recessed, stamped, into the metal. So even if the black ink were to come off (hasnt come off ater a few years) you can still read the numbers. A little bit of lubrication with some silicone or rust penetrant helps keep it sliding smooth, and if you dont, it rusts up and makes it really rough and may even give some strange tread depth readings. The pintle is quite strong (used it as a screwdriver on a desperate situation once) and the ink is long lasting."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This tool was just what I needed for a difficult to access connector. Lots of under hood connectors get very brittle and fragile with age but this worked great in my application and I was able to lift the retaining snap just enough to remove it without breakage. Will it work every time...probably not but it always helps to have the right tool for the job to minimize frustration. The tool I received had a grey handle not red like the picture. Not a big deal for me but thought it was worth mentioning for people who care about that..."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had always used a different brand for all my interior car detailing.  I was out of product and came across this.  After reading some of the reviews I thought I would give it a try. Was I ever happy I did. This is the best detailing product for all interior car surfaces that I have ever used.  My car is 12 years old and I have always kept it clean and looking good.  After using Mother's Protectant on the dash and interior surfaces everything looked new again!  Even the faux wood trim.  I then applied the product to every seal around the window and doors, they then looked deep black and new.  In spots that were to small to get into I used an old toothbrush.  I have now made Mother's Protectant my go to interior detailing product as well as the product I use on all weather stripping and rubber seals."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I detailed two of my cars this week and used a paste wax on the Corvette while going through the identical process on my Jeep except using this liquid wax as the last step. The wax was very easy to put on and easy to use. In-fact I think it was easier to use than the paste wax. However, when I put both vehicles side by side the shines look identical. I think that is a plus for the liquid wax as it is easier to put on and remove than the paste waxes. I have never gotten a bad Mother's product. This is highly recommended. It may cost a  fraction more than some of the store brands however it is worth it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The Jeep Wrangler (1999 model) has wide plastic type fenders over each wheel well. These black plastic fenders, at least on my vehicle, turned and discolored over the years. I tried numerous products and while many would restore the black, the color would eventually fade and I would be right back to where I started. I ordered this Mother's product and applied that to my fenders. I was very surprised at the amount of color restoration I got from applying two or three coats. The black did return and my fenders looked great. I have now been driving the vehicle about three months and I still have nice looking fenders. I also used the polish on my black running boards and the end caps on both the front and rear bumpers. All received the polish well and color looks good. It is easy to apply and then wife. Don't leave the polish on too long after drying as it will be more difficult to polish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've tried every blackening product out there, Black-Magic, Armor All, Meguiar's, and even my own concoction and none work as well as this. Not only that, it lasts about 3-4 weeks outside in the weather, which I find amazing.Also it seems like the more you use it, the better it looks and the longer it stays black. Plus it has a pleasant smell, which is always nice.The only complaint I have is that it is a bit runny, which can make applying it a bit hard, but it's still worth every cent.A must have for anyone with black trim/molding!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this product based on positive reviews by amazon.com customers to restore the rear trim on my 1998 Buick Riviera. While it makes a nice shine, Back to Black did NOT make the trim black again; it remains grey. I expected a more drastic improvement, like some of the tire shine products.In fact, I tried Black Magic &#34;Tire Wet&#34; on the rear trim, and it provides at least as good a shine as Back to Black.Bottom line : product is okay, but will not by any means restore black trim back to black"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The good news is that this is easy to spray on and wipe off. The spray handle gives a fine mist that covers a good area. The spray wipes off easily. The bad news is that the shine is not much better than if I had just washed it and left it. Maybe it will get better over time as the coating builds up. It also streaks a bit but this is minimized if you use a good microfiber cloth.  It's good stuff but doesn't give me the kind of shine I would get from a regular wax job."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this with the Mothers Powerball 4Paint and it went on easily, and I could spend the time on every surface giving the polishing I wanted, without wearing out my hands.  I have a white car, so the effect was not as visible as it would be on a darker car, but the smooth feel of the surface afterwards told me it did a great job.  I also used the Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, and Step 3 wax, and the car looks showroom new.  There is enough left in the bottle, after doing my full-size car, for at least another full-size car.  Good value!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used Mothers California Gold Clay Bar to clean my car's paint before using DA polisher.  I washed my car two times and then used Mother's clay bar.  Even after two washes, when I ran my hand on the paint to feel the surface before and after claying I could feel the difference.  After claying the paint was appreciably smoother.The application was very easy - just spray the included solution and slide the bar on the paint, knead the clay when it smudges appear.  The box warns that if the bar is dropped it has to be discarded, so I was mindful of not dropping it and I did not.  It was quite easy to hold and use.The only thing I did not like about this product is that the solution smelled like cinnamon.  I am not a fan of cinnamon and that smell is unpleasant to me.Overall, this is a great product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have been detailing cars and aircraft for forty years.I have tried almost every thing out there as far as waxes and cleaners go.I'm am a old school Simoniz guy. Yea, lots of work...but it works.I would always use a cleaner first, Dupont worked.I figured it might be time to try something new.So I tried the Mothers clay bar. Did not work well.I tried Meguires Clean and wax and that stuff is great.Tried Klasse, real good stuff.Micro fiber.. the more you spend, the better you get.The clay was a joke."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use this on My New 2013 KIA RIO and it pulls the Dirt off the Car after I thoroughly wash it. An Amazing product, works like a charm. The spray has a Cinnamon smell to it, its not bad but For people who don't like Cinnamon I feel sorry for you,k But I would use this None the Less.It pulls the contaminates off the car and yes you can hear it, it does help remove tar, bugs can be stubborn but do come off. Make sure you use plenty of spray and don't push hard, you need to glide across the paint."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My wife parked under a tree that left tiny sap particles all over the car (a 2011 VW Sportwagen). I've tried using mineral spirits which did nothing so I tried this. While it didn't make the car perfect, it made a very noticeable improvement. Had I not dropped one of the bars on the ground and immediately discarded it, I think I could have made an even better improvement. I was careful not to press too hard, but I did use some pressure. As others noted, this did cause some very faints scratches which were easily removed with wax."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Never did this type of detailing to my cars before and was introduced to it by a friend.After getting the hang of using a clay bar on vehicle it is a truly impressive thing to see as it strips off all the junk our cars seem to accumulate over time and gets off the stuff that harms paint and makes it both LOOK and FEEL horrible!For the money both this kit and the Meguiar's are a great deal and even though it only has 2 clay bars there is plenty  to get the job done on a few cars for sure! You should definetly get a refill bottle of the detail spray since it needs to be applied liberally when doing the clay bar process. Having a gallon jub handy is good to do since you cant let this stuff dry out during the job!Cant say enough about this system of cleaning your car off from all the oxidation and grime that builds up over the years!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The clay bar is excellent, works wonders at removing all the little bits of grit and grime and leaving a mirror smooth-to-the-touch finish. The detailer and microfiber cloth are a bonus, however any quick detailer will work just fine for using the clay bar. I used the clay bar for the first time on my brand new Shelby GT500 which had a bit of grime built up from the trip from the factory to the dealer. I love how it felt after I was done. So smooooooth. I will definitely be using it often and will order another one of these in the future when I need to."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I like this kit a lot!It comes with 2 bigs bars of clay, think double the size of the Meguiars kit.A bottle of detail spray and a average quality microfiber cloth.I used autowash soap/water as a lube for the clay, did a great job on my 7 yr old van, I only washed it in 7 yrs....the paint is now smooth as a baby's bum, waxed it....My kids were wondering why the van was sooo slippery smooth and shineyI saved the detail spray to keep my cars looking tip top after washes.Great price here at Amazon, will keep buying it here."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This RTV is intended for primary use as engine gasket maker - temperature and oil resistant. But it also works well as general purpose RTV when the near-black (dark gray) color is desirable. Which was true for my application - making gaskets for mounting car speakers in odd sized door application that required custom spacers. Worked great.The dark color is especially troublesome to get off the hands - use disposable gloves during application.This package, a small &#34;squeeze&#34; tube is not easiest for application of a regular bead. It is easier to use the slightly larger, calk-gun sized package, so consider that if the larger quantity is also helpful."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this in order to seal some parts of my car's valve cover mating surfaces.The shop I paid for the timing belt service to be done did not do a good job.Valve cover gasket never leaked before, it started leaking after they put a new gasket.Obviously they did not clean the mating surfaces.I did the job myself since I did not trust the mechanics at that particular shop.It does not leak now.This product also helped me repair parts of glass molding (rubber parts around the rear glass) that started cracking, falling off.All in all it is a great product and is worth the money."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Purchased this product to remove a minor scratch, it ate through my clearcoat and left me with $400 in damage. Had an auto detailer look at the damage before getting it fixed, he asked what product caused it and I told him &#34;ScratchX 2.0&#34; - he replied &#34;Oh, I would never even use that stuff, it's too abrasive.&#34;Bottom line, from my experience with this product: do not purchase it under any circumstance unless you are very experienced working on cars.This is truly a one star item. Avoid at all costs."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "You need patience, but it works great. I have a short attention span and got pissed off after 30 seconds of rubbing it (stupid, I know) and was going to rant about this. Then I calmed down and rubbed a moderately deep scratch for another 2 minutes as hard as I could without damaging the paint. It worked. It wasn't perfect but more than 12 inches away there was no way you could tell. It obviously won't work on scratches where there's no paint left, but if there's the white haze over it, it should work. My method was about half circular motions and half 90 against the grain. If you rub even a little bit in the direction of the scratch, any scratch removing compound is likely to screw you even more."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product works at least as well as other similary priced scratch removers/hiders....only really effective on very shallow and narrow scratches and swirl marks. I have tried 3 of these specialized scratch products, and none of them hide scratches quite as well as regular Eagle One NanoWax (now discontinued). These products work by filling in the scratch with material that makes the scratch visible only under certain lighting conditions and viewing angles. Meguiars, like most of the others, work better than ordinary wax at hiding very minor scratches, but don't expect miracles."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I wasn't surprised when I tried the 2.0.  Very effective polish for novice to enthusiast just as how it was with their original ScratchX.For those that aren't getting good results, you are probably not using the product correctly, or your scratch is just too deep.I like that there is no shaking needed.  I just grab the bottle, pour a dab onto my pad, and immediately use.Also the worked in polish easily wipes off the panel.I am very happy with the results.I consider myself a weekend car enthusiast, use professional equipment to detail my cars."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use it to keep the clear lexan cover on my squad car light bar maintained.  Makes it look like new and seems to provide a lasting protective finish that is superior to other products that I've tried.  Works well on those \"plastic\" headlight covers that tend to haze over.  The container tube is good quality and has not cracked and split open like some other brands I've used.  They even put a hole in the base of the tube so you can hang it on a nail on the garage wall (or on a chain around your neck, I suppose).On paint???  Outstanding!!  I think you'll be pleased."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is great wax! It truly deserves the Gold Class name. I use this after the Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher. I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great. I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color. Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue. Nothing really deep. After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire. It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun. There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results. The water also beads very nice, too."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this on my dark red mustang and did half the car only. I could not tell any difference. Went back and finished the car and it looked great but it look great before using this so not sure what I was gaining.By reading all the reviews I was expecting a wow factor.Maybe it does better on older cars but my mustang is not new either but in good shape.Also used it on an 09 Focus and again, no difference.Makes me wonder with these clear coats in that these products do not get down to the paint level and sinceclear coats are already glossy, a good polish does little.Not that impressed but will give it 3 stars since most people have good luck with it but my advise is if you havea car with good paint and clear coat, do not expect miracles."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this on a 92 Mercedes 500SL which I had found sitting on a lot. Once this car was mine, I noticed it has some weathered and rough looking areas on the hood, where rain had left deposits. I simply rubbed this on that area, left it over night, and took off that coat. The repeated the process about 3 times. Within 4-5 days, the hood looked like the rest of the car. That is exactly what I bought it for, and it worked perfect."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Used this on two cars, one silver and one black.Both were done on a cool day in the garage after a clay bar routine.The silver car was super easy and looked great when finished. It came off even easier and faster than I expected using micro-fiber cloths.The black car took more work and had swirls at first. I hit it with an orbital buffer and the swirls were gone.Highly recommend two applications of this for full coverage. It goes fast enough that two applications are no big deal."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Finally used up my first bottle of this after a few years.  The great thing about this wax is that it is easy to remove the dried haze.  You can leave it overnight if want and it still buffs off easily.  Also it does not turn most plastic white if you get some on the plastic but I still avoid it.You don't need to apply much, just enough to cover the surface.  Does not have much polishing action so the paint needs to be clean before starting.  Also I use it on chrome, chromed plastic, etc."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is an easy to apply excellent wax. It does contain petroleum distillates (not stated on package but I called company to find out) so I cannot get any on the 3M film installed on the nose of my Corvette, a disadvantage for this vehicle. For waxing on paint it does a great job and is very durable on our 4Runner daily driver. I deducted one star because there was no yellow application pad in the package as stated.  Called Meguiars and they are sending me one.7/3 update... Deducted an additional star as no sponge received on timely basis as had been promised by Maguiars."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product is easy to apply and easy to wipe off.  But, on black cars especially, it does not give a nice deep glossy or \"wet look\" shine.  It leaves more of a streaky oily finish.I switched over to yellow carnuba wax and the difference was night and day.  I have a full bottle that I no longer use and it's just sitting in the garage collecting dust.If you have a black car, and stick with carunba wax instead of synthetics. Meguiar's to make great products, but this one fails to impress.I get a better shine off of Meguiar's cleaner wax than this NXT stuff.But a friend introduced me to Mothers pure carnuba wax and I have since made a switch in brand.  I mean the shine you get with this stuff is just insane."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have a Porter Cable 7336SP dual action polisher with the backing pad and the Meguiar's 6.5 inch pads fit perfectly and securely. I like these pad very much. I use Meguiar's Ultimate Polish with this pad to remove minor swirls and minor scratches on the clean coat of my car. I place product on the pad, lay it on the car and turn on the polisher so as not to sling product. The Porter Cable 7336 polisher is not the most powerful, so when I first begin polishing, the machine rotates the pad when I don't add much pressure. However, as the product becomes loaded with wet polish, the pad begins to drag and loses its rotation. It helps that the pad is not &#34;so&#34; thick and that the edges are tapered. I've solved the problem by having a second pad to change out to finish the second half of the vehicle. The pads are easy to clean and I let them dry with the Velcro pad facing up. I am pleased with the results."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Haven't used it yet because I'm still looking for the interface to hook on my buffer wheel...I bought something for that and I'm still back to &#34;square zero&#34;...you would think that in the marketing of this sort of product the seller would fill in the gaps on the other things you need to hook everything up. Not sure I can use it without buying a totally new buffer (which I really don't want to do, since I just bought one). If you already have a hook and loop wheel on your buffer, this product may be just fine."}

I only had one pad and had to wash it after using Mirror Glaze and before using NXT Wax. I attached the wet pad to the DA polisher and turned it on to spin the water out of the pad. The pad did not fly off.Using the DA Polisher and foam pads allowed me to perform a lot of time and labor consuming tasks in a lot less time if I attempted to do it by hand.I am very satisfied with this pad."}

Basically, the flute hadn't been used in over 30 years and sat around becoming dull and oxidized.  Needless to say, after some dabs of Flitz and about 10 or more squares of paper towels, it looks brand new!  The paper towels and my hands were so black with oxidation, it was truly amazing.This stuff has done it all for me and I can easily say it is the best cleaner an polish out there.  Hands down."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "I just used this pad to remove oxidation of a very large Rv. I used it with McGuires 3 part RV oxidation compound set for fiberglass. It took a med blemished oxidated gelcoat finish and turned it into a mirror finish smooth, no burns or scratches.Oxidation is totally off finish. Its a great pad. Well worth the cost and it really held up enough to do entire 28 ft rv. Good solid foam no junk. Make sure you clean pad as it builds up. I just hold a hand scrub brush on wheel and let in spin on pad. Pad is strong enough to stand up to some good pressure."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This pad and the yellow polishing pad are perfect. Cell foam material is durable, wash and reuse. This pad worked perfectly on my Home Depot's Ridgid Random Orbital Sander with the hook and loop pad. Don't spend $140+ on a so called \"car\" random orbital polisher. The Ridgid is basically the same thing...yet only costs $60 and I can use it for home improvement work after my car is done. Meguiar's Scratch X 2.0 also works good with this pad to remove minor scratches and blemishes. Use Ultimate Compound for heavier oxidization."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used Simichrome on some golf irons where I used a MAP torch to heat the epoxy. This caused a light heat stain to form on the hosel, which is just surface oxidation. Simichrome removed it, but so did Blue Magic which is less expensive and readily available.I tried Simichrome on my Ducati exhaust, which has turned purple at the cylinder heads. Simichrome didn't even dent the oxidation, which Blue Magic will help reduce. I did notice that Simichrome seems to provide a brighter luster to polished surfaces and even brushed surfaces.Overall: 3/5 stars, expensive, can be hard to find, Blue Magic does the same job mostly. I felt Simichrome provided a shinier finish after an application."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Also had some baked on oil stains on  tti ceramic coated headers on our 70 challenger caused by leaking rear main seal. Once repaired tried semichrome to remove them. No success at all.  Again pulled out the mother's,,,,although slow and tedious, it did the job with no damage to ceramic coating.Screw on lid on mother's makes far better sense.  Semichrome lid requires an inconvenient  pry tool to remove,,,,which tends to clobber lid causing it to not seal well.  Additionally semichrome is somewhat on the order as twice as expensive.  I should have purchased a tube instead of a can to give it a try,,,would have saved 15 or so dollars."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Really wasn't sure if this would work. Didn't even understand how to use it until I received it. Sat on the shelf until the heater in my Tundra reminded me that I needed something that would remove that musty, moldy odor. This has a long tube that you insert into the vents in the center of the dash. Push the tubing in as far as you can (which is almost all of the tubing's length) and depress the button on the top. I did it both vents but never emptied the can. Then ran the blower. It wasn't until a few days later when the weather was typically that which would make me notice the musty smell but it wasn't there!! Very, very happy with this and even happier that I didn't have to take the truck to a repair shop for a 'flushing' of the venting system. Try it, you'll like it!!"}

Oh and be carefull because other people complain that the hose curls up and goes back out and sprays them in the face.  It didn't happen to me but just in case. You are not so sharp  Ha!!"}

I was having a very damp mildew odor from my car but was unable to find a good effective solution to that.I got my air conditioning system cleaned,refrigerant vacuumed and refilled but was unable to get rid of that smell completely. However after reading reviews on Amazon,decided to give it a try and yes,it did it well. Will definitely recommend this if you wanted to get rid of unwanted disturbing odors and will suggest to use it periodically to make your ride more pleasant."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "After reading the reviews on this product, I decided to bite the bullet and pay the high price for cockpit premium. I couldn't wait to get the stuff and start using it and I was excited to see for myself firsthand what the great fragrance was that everyone was &#34;ramping & raving about.Yes, the smell is nice for the whole 5 minutes you smell it. But after that, it dissipates into the air and you no longer can smell it. As far as the cleaning part goes, I'm not impressed with that either.I would not recommend this product to a friend unless it was $5 to $6 bucks cheaper."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "ArmorAll is great if you're in your teens and want your interior to look like you cleaned it with a can of crisco.  Even their matte products still leave you with a glossy sheen.  When it comes to me and my cars, I tend to look for quality products that I can use over and over again.  I've always found that with einszett products.  From interior to exterior, their products work flawlessly and produce great results.  The additional minty, slightly clinical yet sweet smell is always welcome in my vehicles.  Don't think twice, you won't be disappointed."}

It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This little product has its place, but I don't think in its present form that it can replace road flares.  The idea is a good one, and with a little tweaking, the product might be a great item for an emergency road kit.  If they made the flare bigger, larger light emitting head, and light from all sides, I think they would have a winner.  In its current form, it is too small and too lightweight to be of much use.  One would need several, and at almost $10 each, that would be expensive.  I think a couple of them in a glove box might be a good idea, but no replacement for a huge flashlight and some road flares.A good idea but needs work."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This may be something that would be nice to have in your emergency pack, but it is small, toylike and not really functional as a \"flare\"  The light that is generated is bright in both the flash and continous shine mode, but the light is directional.  It projects basically in one direction as opposed to being a genuine flare style that projects in a 360 degree radius.  For a carry-around for emergency use it would provide some help, but I think there are better flameless flares on the market that would work better.  This is a lower cost item, so you may want to consider that when you make a comparison.  I give it three out of 5 stars but I can't recommend it to anyone who may consider this to be a complete emergency flare solution."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "There are definitely some advantages to this over a traditional flare. It will last much longer, and it has a magnetic base that is strong enough to hold it on a metal part of your car.  The battery cap screws on and has a gasket in case it is raining. It is also compact and lightweight.The disadvantage is that it isn't anywhere near as bright as a flare. It has a single LED that is very directional. If it was placed on the road in front of a car it would be very easy to overlook.I think a folding triangle with reflective tape along with a couple of flares would be a safer alternative.Sean P.

{"label": 2, "raw": "The main reason I like this style frame is that the license plate goes on top of the frame, no part of the frame obscures anything on the plate.  Most bulkier frames cover about a 1\" wide strip at the top and/or bottom of the plate.  In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a \"vanity\" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate.  This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased.  The first one lasted about 4 years.  However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car."}

Instead of having the key portion in the short end so that you have the leverage of the long when you tighten the screws down but instead the key portion is in the tip of the long end so that you only have about one inch of tool to tighten the screws with so if they're tight, you'll end up like me with a box end wrench looped over the tool to complete the job. I still recommend this product."}

If your mounting screws go straight into your car rather than taking the lock nuts behind a bracket, these screws will most likely be too big to fit. I just drilled out the plastic pieces that were mounted to my car and then just threaded these in. Ended up with a nice tight fit.

{"label": 2, "raw": "This is one other item you need for your Hi-Lift jack. This allows you to lift curved bumpers, or ones without notches in them specifically for this type of jack. Great small accessory that goes well with the jack itself. Heavy duty and will last many years. I did modify this with some rubber to not mar metal finish of my bumpers though. If you have plastic bumpers, don't use this, it will leave marks. A friend of mine did that with my jack and them complained. Like it was the jacks fault he was stupid. This is metal and could scratch if you are trying to lift someone that is softer material. Comes with bolts that look too small but do the job. I added larger ones that are stronger, but the ones that come with it are rated for the correct weight loading. You need this for your jack. Will help with some fence posts of odd shape as well."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I'm a little disappointed in Hi-Lift Jack. Top is 2 piece and welded in the middle. Should have been one piece. They supplied a bolt rather than some sort of quick release pin to attach it. A bolt with a hand tightened nut will vibrate loose during transport. The hook on the bottom could have been a little deeper to grab onto other items other than round bumpers more securely. All in all a good add-on for your Hi-lift jack but it could have been designed a little better."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "You can use this bad boy as a base for your Wrangler's bottle jack - especially if your lift kit has put the axles a tad out of reach. If you have a Discovery, you will need to Dremel out small notch for the OEM bottle jack.  High Lift jacks are great accessories, but they're not all that safe for changing tires in the field when you think about it.  For that, a bottle jack with a good base and an axle lift point will get you going just fine."}

Having never been satisfied with the \"just after the oil change feeling\" with SYN3, there was a noticeable improvement in engine smoothness and reduction in engine noise during the next 2,500 miles I kept this oil in the bike.  These are things you notice when you become connected to your bike, as you fellow bikers know.  I have used Mobil 1 since because of this experience and because I can get it from Amazon cheap.  It's probably not as good as AIMSOIL, but it's very good and I'm confident it's doing a great job."}

Use a wet cloth to wipe the Lexol off. Bam! Clean as can be. You might be surprised how dirty your chair can get when you see the colour of the Lexol foam after scrubbing. Make sure you apply leather conditioner/oil after cleaning to maintain the leather itself. This product is only the cleaner side of things."}

My car was brand new, but it sat on the car lot front line, next to a major Highway and major feeder street, so it had quite a bit of particles on it.  You could not see it, but you could feel it.  I used the clay kit by Meguiar's to remove all of the particles before I waxed my car.  The surface, after claying, was absolutely smooth and the wax went on easily."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "When researching what to do to make my car paint smooth as glass, I found this clay kit.  Works wonders, especially on weathered finishes.  Test your paint surface for roughness (everyone's has some) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint.  If it feels rough, which it should, then Meguiar's Clay Detailer is the cure!  Using the spray as a lubricant, the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which cannot be removed by washing alone (tar, etc.).  I love it!"}

You should definetly get a refill bottle of the detail spray since it needs to be applied liberally when doing the clay bar process. Having a gallon jub handy is good to do since you cant let this stuff dry out during the job!Cant say enough about this system of cleaning your car off from all the oxidation and grime that builds up over the years!"}

It will add shine and luster to polished aluminum wheels where they have faded or tarnished a bit. I use it by hand but you could use it with a buffer if your wheels are really tarnished.I would not recommend it for highly polished wheels or aluminum, for that I recommend Mother's Billet Polish. The difference between the two Mother's polishes is the amount of abrasive and cleaners in each one. If your wheels or aluminum parts are in really good shape, the Billet Polish will give them a mirror finish, the Mag and Aluminum Polish will probably slightly dull the finish. If the wheels or aluminum parts have lost their shine then I would recommend the Mag and Aluminum Polish. There is a big difference between the two but not detailed enough on Mother's website."}

It typically indicates to me that the manufacturer is looking to cut costs and maximize profit vs. putting out the highest quality product that they can. This unit has a metal housing.Anyhow, this unit was super easy to set up on my motorcycle and lawnmower. With the leads already installed, I just have to plug it in. The conditioning mode of this tender will go a long ways in increasing the battery life as well.I would certainly recommend this unit!"}

It will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days.  At this low amperage it isn't ideal for this, but it will work.This is about $50.  A new battery is about $100.  Leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time (months) kills the battery.  Do the math and you see you can't afford not to have one."}

It took  my battery from stone dead  to a full charge within 24 hours and it automatically maintains a full charge. It uses LED lights to let you know the status of your battery. I wish it had a gauge instead of the lights but I still would highly recommend this to friends and family."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you have one of the millions of GM pick ups with the base mirrors these are a reasonable add on for towing.  They are easy to install after some practice.  Easy to remove - not sure why some other reviewers had problems with this...  Just unscrew the clamp and slide them off.  They are a little tough to adjust because you need to move the mirror beyond where you want it and let it snap back a bit. Just takes a little time.  Once adjusted they stayed put. They are stable on the highway but on bumpy roads they cause my OEM mirror glass to vibrate more than the add ons.  This is probably due to the extra weight of these.  You will definitely want to take them off when you are not towing.  They make your truck look like Dumbo and people will bump them in parking lots.  Best price by far was Amazon when I bought them."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Put these on a 2006 Yukon Denali XL to see around a 26' travel trailer. They fit like a glove and look very nice. Both the mount and the mirror are solid. You can adjust the little mirror, but it is stiff enough that it doesn't vibrate going down the road. The instructions recommend cleaning your mirror before you put these on and I would recommend it too. The didn't scratch my mirrors and they were hard to slide on and off, but they are tight enough that if you have a large chunk of something on your mirror, it may cause damage to your mirror over time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Highly recommended.  Just make sure it has ample water to get started (1 gallon minimum).  Used in warm and cooler weather without issue.*Update:  4/2014: after camping an entire season with these, I found that they didn't work very well.  Tissue and waste didn't seem to break down very well, and it most certainly doesn't mask odors very well.  I even tried using 2 packets instead of one (for a 30 gallon tank); no difference aside from things being very blue!I think I'm going to try the \"tried and true\" Happy Campers  Organic treatment next."}

That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex.  This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again."}

They provide some outward pressure on the closure mechanism (pressure needed to provide battery contact).  Like the old unit, it uses plastic tabs to hold it closed.

This keeps the elevation correct to the Y connector.  After that, the site was pretty level, so there wasn't much of a problem.I've only used these once, so I cannot comment on longevity, but I would likely replace them if they break sooner than later."}

I also use this to tank up our onboard water storage when I am using it.  NOTE:  You will want to run water through the filter for several minutes before hooking it up to clear out the carbon dust.

Rather than fool aroung with the nuisance of returning it, I reworked the crimp with a hammer & punch. I was able to make it secure enough that I can use the valve without the handle coming loose. Hopefully, it will not work loose & be lost due to vibrations on the road."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "These are good. Not necessarily better than other wheel chock. Honestly a wheel chock is a wheel chock. However, the cord makes all the difference. When you kick these up under the tires and then jack a car the chocks wedge up under there really tight. When the car comes down the chocks need some help to come out. Yank the cord and you're done. I also like having a bright color chock so I don't forget they are there. Don't buy black ones. They'll blend in with the tires you're likely to forget. These are very noticeable. The chock itself is on par with others, but the features (cord and color) are what make it stand out."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "I found a link testing different Cold Air Intakes (CAI) for this model truck (2003-2007.5) done from blackbear performance.  The tube alone produced 5~HP along with most others. I don't think I will post the link but googling it up for a 2004 silverado CAI dyno tested should get you what you want. Best bang for your buck. Removes a lot of extra tubing that doesn't need to be their. When installing, put the metal clamp things on first, then the rubber tube. Fit the rubber tube over the fittings (Air box or the Intake itself) then put the metal clamps over the rubber tubes that connect the Intake tube to the rest of the motor/air box. This is the easiest way to install it since the holes that this tube has to go over distort it enough to make installing with the metal clamps on impossible. After I figured this out, it only took me ten minutes after fighting with it for fifteen. Good luck and happy Hunting! :)"}

Also, the directions tell you to let the polymer cure/bind to your paint/clear coat for 12 hours.  This is very important for a good, long lasting shine.

This makes RejeX far more convenient.As others have noted you have to apply this product very thinly.  If you don't you'll get a real good workout huffing it off.  The best application method requires a DA polisher because you can lay down a very thin coat easily.Applied properly, you'll need very little to do your car.

{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought a used RV.  It was our first.  Got it home and was doing some cleaning and general maintenance on it when I found the anode rod out of the hot water heater.  Now I have never had to deal with this before so I think that the junk on there needs to come off so I put it in a bucket with vinegar.  My buddy who has been RVing for a few years starts to laugh at me.  I had cleaned it down to the little copper wire in the middle.  He said it should be large looking.  So I get on Amazon and look it up and sure enough here it is.  Live and learn.Bottom line:It fits our RV hot water heater and was a great price.  Check them about once a year and flush out your tank when you change it.  It keeps the tank from rusting."}

I think the \"ounce of prevention\" rule was written for RV and home owners.  Anode rods are designed to prevent harmful build-up in your hot water heater by causing the build-up to form on them.  Yes it works!  While your getting one for you camper, you might want to check the one in your house hot water heater (yes it has one too, and I bet it's in need of replacement as well.)  5 minutes and 15 bucks can save you hundreds down the road."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this at the same time as a load equalizing hitch.  I wasn't sure I needed it as the trailer seemed to tow fine, but I thought it might be useful in high wind.  After towing with the sway control installed, I plan to use it whenever I am towing.  It seems to cancel out a lot of the small movements created by the trailer and makes the tow vehicle ride better and feel more stable.  The only disadvantage I have found is that the sway control \"groans\" going around corners.  This is one of those \"that is just the way it works\" situations, but it would be nice if it were quieter.  It also adds another step to hitching up the trailer, but the sway control is very easy to install and remove.  Overall, a worthwhile addition even for a trailer that tows well already."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Going from a diesel pusher back to a 5th wheel I was already getting grief as to how much more movement of the RV would be felt over that of the diesel pusher while raised up on the leveling system.Not being new to the 5th wheel movement and shaking when parked and people moving around inside I ordered this as I have used one in the past.  While a 5th wheel king pin stabilizer will not eliminate all of the movement it does greatly reduce the movement.It is easy to assemble, easy to use though a little on the heavy side.  But, then with weight comes strength I guess.  I have tried it out and am pleased with the improvements it has given.Amazon had the best price I could locate after an extensive internet shopping for price including shipping.  And of course there is that great customer service and return policy Amazon offers should you experience a problem.Over all I give it two thumbs up for performance and value."}

This review would have been 5 stars if I didn't have to go out on my own and buy the ball mount as well. Didn't have it listed as included but I just bought a Curt mount for my Lexus GS350 which one was included... Lesson here is if you plan to install and use on the same day order a ball mount as well. Install was a total PITA!! The bolts holes used to mount the hitch itself were rusted to no end (2005 MDX) and the ONLY way for me to get the bolts in was to use one of the old ones that held up the tow hook you remove and using that as a thread cutter with WD-40... I also used an old round plastic brush and brushed the threads with lubricant as well!! Install took almost 5 hours due to this unforeseen problem."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "The only thing I have against scissor jacks is that after they have been raised to the height prior to having to level my 31' RV, it requires quite a hefty force to raise it for leveling. The included socket and turn handle had the pin break at the socket and I had to improvise with an icepick for a temporary repair. A Camco socket that I purchased also for using fit perfect, but a 3/8\" drill wanted to burn out tring to raise the jacks. I plan to use something more powerful next time. I'd like to see some gearing on the crank to make the jack raise easier when leveling my rv. THe Jack does have the strength and ability to take the weight without any problem."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "This baby right here is an excellent  wheel scrubbers for trucks, some convertibles, and sedans.  Using at the same time with some tire cleaners, it made cleaning out the wheels and rims a breeze. However two this I didn't like about the giant furry mace. One, it has a metal clip on the top of the brush, so if you're not careful, you can do serious damage. Two, it's huge! I mean you can sword fight with someone with this thing when the time comes. It can be handy for large tires, but damn, it's like the brush when manufactured took steroids. But overall it is a nice LARGE brush of the century."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This brush cleans well and is large enough to easily clean wider wheels like 8 or 9inches wide.However, the downside is that the tip of the brush has the metal spine exposed and, if you're not careful, can damage the finish of your precious wheel if you're not careful when about to put it between the spokes.You can't really tell that from the pictures, and it may seem minor, but it takes a lot of thought each time you're about to clean your wheel to remember to be extra careful using it."}

The vehicle seems to accelerate easier, and less pedal was required to keep it moving.  I knew this was good stuff, but I was pleasantly surprised after changing the oil.  I notice very similar results after every engine oil change.  no joke."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I can't say that you'll have the same results, but my experience with this stuff was great. I put this in the differential of my 1994 Mustang GT. The rear end was a little bit whiny. So I figured that I'd better change the fluid. So I did. with this stuff. Now the car seems to gain RPM's a little faster, and the whine noise from the rear end is gone. It even seems to burn out a little easier when I take it to the track. Maybe the old fluid was just finally wore out, who knows. But I had a good experience with this stuff so I thought I'd share."}

The foam started disintegrating almost immediately when run across any angle of the wheels surface.  The foam is simply too weak, it rips and shreds.

Grab a rag and you'll be done a lot faster."}

The finish on my car is already pretty good with very little swirls, and this makes my finish look almost flawless. It applies very easily and comes up very easily and there is never any leftover residue. I would recommend this wax to anyone that details their own car."}

It cuts through brake dust that soap wont even touch.however you cant really just leave it on for 30 seconds and spray it off. if the cleaner sits on one area too long, it begins to dry, and leaves behind residue. I find its best to use a couple sprays of this on a sponge with a liberal dose of water. Rinse quickly, do multiple scrub downs if needed. You only need a spritz, so its not like you have to worry about wasting product.Use it right and you'll love it. a bottle lasts me at least 6 months of almost weekly washing."}

It looked horrible! The tires looked better before I used it!409 and Simple Green do a better of cleaning than this product.I will never trust this brand for any product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been looking for a good tire cleaner since Meguiars discontinued making an aerosol tire cleaner. I gave this a try and I love it. I still use a brush to really work it in and it gets all the old tire shine off and you get a really nice all natural rubber finish. It also did a great job with the rims. Again I always use a brush to get into the nooks and crannies.Overall I love it, will buy more, but like others have said it doesn't go far. I have about 1/3 left after doing two cars. They really need to make a bulk jug so I can just refill the applicator bottle. Since I scrub the tires anyway I may adjust the amount I use. I went pretty heavy since it was the first time using it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff works - is all I can say about it. I bought some used rims that had brake dust literally caked onto the wheels. I really didn't think this stuff was going to work, but it did! Note, I did use a brush for physical agitation after spraying the wheels with this. I don't think this is the kind of thing you can spray, let sit and just rinse away the brake dust if it's pretty severe. For light circumstances, I think that would work fine."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had sanded off part of the clear coat around my wheels to deal with some curb rash I had gotten. I had previously used &#34;Bleche White&#34; as my wheel/tire cleaner, and it didn't effect the bare aluminum on my wheel. This stuff does, it left weird white tarnish marks all over the part with bare metal. I can get it off by sanding further with fine grit sandpaper and then polishing with metal polish, but it's really annoying.That being said, it really cleans your tires and wheels well. Better than &#34;Bleche White&#34; for sure, but I will probably stop using it for my car because of the metal corrosion issue."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used this wheel cleaner this past weekend on my stock painted alloy wheels. They had become dirty with brake dust and road grime and the drive through car wash was no help. With the nice weather I treated the car to a personal car wash. I followed the instructions and the wheels are clean. The only problem is you need to use a lot of the foaming spray to cover the wheels various surfaces. On my car one 24 oz. bottle should cclean the four wheels twice. Since this is the first wheel cleaner of this type I'm not sure if that expensive. However, I'm very please with the easy no touch results."}

DO NOT expect this to wash your wheels for you, you still need to get down and scrub, this just helps alot. Though it runs out quick, it is inexpensive.Pros: Works, you'll see the brown grime coming off the tires and the black dust from the wheels.Smells like cherry (some will put that in the Cons)great for nooks and cranniesSafe for almost all wheelsOne of my fav solutions to cleaning tirewalls (clean shiny tires DO make a difference)Cons: Runs out QUICK, you'll be getting another bottle before you know ittrigger a bit small, tires the fingers rather fast"}

Does a great job cleaning. I drive a Porsche Boxster S and keeping it clean is my first priority.I suggest cleaning your wheels once a week since the brake dust that gets on your wheels is acidic and will corrode your wheels over time. I was recommended to try this on a Porsche owners site and I think these people have a very good idea on what it takes to keep a car looking nice.Cheers"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Your wheels typically have a clearcoat, and this is sprayed on, then using a soft brush, you can get all the brake dust off, then rinse the wheel.  But you can ALSO spray the rest of your car with this.  Brake dust settles on the lower part of your car's front doors, so you can spray these along the bottom.  I use my hand (with a glove) to rub the liquid as I hose it down, and it cleans all of the dust and much of the road tar, meaning very little use of the abrasive clay that most detailers will resort to for tough spots.  This is a less aggressive alternative to clay, and should be in every car-lover's arsenal.Recommended!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If you are searching for a good, high-quality wheel cleaner, look no further! Not only is it pH balanced to ensure that you don't damage the finish of various wheels you may clean, its cleaning power is second to none. If you have a vehicle that generates a lot of brake dust (BMW, namely, but other vehicles that have fade-resistant brakes), you can spray P21S on the wheel wipe around with the provided sponge let sit for a few minutes and spray off and they'll look good as new. I occasionally (~50k miles) take off the wheels and clean the caked on stuff on the inside of the rim, too. It takes a bit more scrubbing but cleans it to make it look new every time. If you can't get this stuff to take whatever you have on your wheel, you will likely need to refinish the wheel - this stuff is the very best!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I am writing this review after three years of ownership:This is the best digital tire gauge I have ever come across.  This Accutire model came highly recommended from reviewers and that is why I eventually bought it.  It features an easy to read red digital readout that gives accurate 0.5lb increments and the readings take less than a second to register.  The tire valve/gauge seal is great, the rubberized handle easy to grip (even with gloves) and the size fits nicely in a glove compartment.  After three years of nearly monthly readings on all my family's cars, I'm yet to replace the batteries.  This is the third digital gauge I've owned; the first one was worthless trash and the second was ok but not particularly well made or durable.  The third time was a charm with this rugged Accutire model.  I highly recommend this gauge for anyone who checks tires regularly, and it is a good idea to check them regularly for safety, tread wear and gas mileage purposes."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "My old Accutire pressure gauge finally died on me after about 6 years.  I was so happy with it I decided to go with another Accutire gauge.  This one has a nice backlit LCD which you can read in the dark (the old one didn't) and has an improved design.  The contour of the unit is such that you can press your thumb on the back to put pressure on the valve seat.  This allows for an even, secure seal when checking pressure.  I notice that I lose much less air when I check with this gauge than I did my older one.The unit measures in 1/2lb increments and seems to be accurate so far.  Can't be beat for the price."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Didn't notice the backlit feature when buying it so that was an unexpected bonus, and a very useful one at that.  This gauge pushes onto the stem very easy and securely feeling. It's very easy to read. I compared it to an old digital gauge I still use, my long-time favorite because it's so easy and reliable, and this one had exactly the same results.  The only slight inconvenience is that the reading doesn't lock on so that could pull it off of the stem to see, you must read while it's still on.  And then due to the shape you have to be a little on the one side to read it.  Really minor inconveniences, it's still very easy to use and seems to be very accurate and consistent.  Will probably pick up one or two more for other cars."}

I went to a local camper store and got a set there the next day. Sometimes, saving a few bucks just ain't worth it!!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use this little charger solely for one purpose. My Corvette sits in the garage and is mostly taken to shows rather than being an everyday car. The Corvette has an issue that sometimes causes a battery discharge especially if left sitting for quite some time. I checked with the car dealer and we found an identical issue with a brand new one sitting on the display floor. Sometimes it is no more than a light or switch left on. In any event this little charger will maintain my battery so that when I do try to start the Corvette I have full battery power. It is not for charging  a dead battery. It has worked well fro me and the price is right. Cord are long enough to reach from my electrical outlet to the fuse box on the Corvette where the connection is made. Great little addition to my garage."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have ordered two of these chargers for maintaining my batteries on my ATV and Riding Mower in the winter months last year and they have done great. I have three more on order right now for more coverage on new Tractor, another ATV and anotherriding mower as well. I also have two maintaining chargers mounted on my boat that are Schumacher brands that have never failed me in the last three years of storing my boat.I also have one Schumacher  Quick Charger for jumping and starting dead batteries. I have never been disappointed with any of the Schumacher chargers at all. My late Father used to use only this brand, and that is why I continue using the Schumacher brand!How can you go wrong with Quality products!!All of my chargers have been ordered from Amazon.com where most of everything I oder comes from. Great service and products all around."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "There is absolutely nothing to set on this charger. You connect it and you wait for it to charge a battery.  It is one of the few that I have seen that will automatically detect 6 and 12 volt batteries and I have about a dozen different kinds of chargers.  It also detects reverse polarity and the little lights are easy to see and interpret.  The clips it comes with are better than the usual kind being shaped for more effective gripping of terminals and larger.The product literature claims it has tempreature compensation and desulphation, but I have not verified either by actual tests."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use it for my Motor scooter, it has a very small 12 volt battery. The small rings in the box fit perfectly (I left them mounted to the battery in the scoot). The quick disconnect is a really nice feature. I ran the battery down once (left the black cable off after maintenance and forgot to connect the schumacher, my bad...). The small scooter batteries are notorious for not holding a charge. When I reattached the cable, I reattached the unit and it recharged it in a few hours. It then kept it charged till the spring. I'm very happy with this unit."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerWell worth the price...does exactly what it is suppose to do.(Update) After using this charger less than 5 mos. to maintain my R.V., which is seldom driven, I have found that, because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly, the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead. Now, I'll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty.(Update) I have contacted the manufacturer, Schumacher, concerning the failure of this charger but after 3 weeks, have received no response and it doesn't look like I am going to. So, I guess I'll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it. BTW, I am using two Chicago Electric on Board chargers, one on my Jeep and the other on my Mercury Sable. Both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the Schumacher or the Battery Tender."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Had it for a week, does what it says it does, but make absolutely sure the clips don't touch anything when it's attached.

Pilot error? Bad design? Who knows.Edit: Just called Schumacher and they're replacing it, no problem. Upping my rating from a ** to ***. Thanks Schumacher."}

Its a battery re-born!  Works like new now... this lil baby does a great job of slow charging and also tells you the battery percentage.  Its made well, very compact and is asthetically pleasing to the eye.  I also love that it has storage in the back to put the cables/clips for storage.If you need a battery charger...this is THE one to get!Buy with confidence!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Very light and easy to store. Fan noise is very noticable but it stays in the garage so who cares.  I love the LED readout for % charged and volts when plugged in and attached to battery.  Very pleased the the charger but for those of you who like the feel of a heavy metal constructed unit that can take a beating this is not your cup of tea.  All plastic and the buttons seem equally flimsey but so far they work well. Time and use will tell how long they will hold up."}

The plastic &#34;booty&#34; that covers the arms I guess supposed to work to prevent snow from clogging the wiper but did it help? Meh....hard to say. The ends of the wipers have some RED plastic caps on them and it's very distracting to see something RED swooshing in front of my face in the rain. Why couldn't they use black caps?I'm going to look for a triple bladed wiper blade which worked better."}

I have an 05 TSX and tried this blade today and the way the tip of blade is, it hits the wiper arm in a way that does not allow the wiper to lay fully flat on the windshield and top tip of blade is about an inch off the windshield.. I used this brand before but they changed the design at some point. It will not work, trust me. I ended up using a brand called rain eater and it works perfectly."}

Went to RV FORUM and there was the answer, purchase a set of  Anco 48-17 9.5mm Straight End Adapter and then pickup wiper blades as these and,,,, oh boy,,, remove old screws (2 per arm), might be tight so I used pointed vise grips to remove. Install new adapters and new wipers for the price of one RV wiper blade or less. I also used plastic tie to hold blade to adapter. THEY WORK GREAT,,,, thanks all for the help,,, STEAMING ON DOWN THE ROAD,,,"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This blade was purchased for the driver's side of the vehicle I installed it on.Installation was easy enough...with no thanks to the rather inscrutable instructions:\"-Remove old wiper blade.-Install new wiper blade.\"Hmm..ya think??On the day I installed this blade (and its 21\" passenger side companion) it was raining, so I got to test it immediately.This wiper makes good contact with the windshield, and cleans without streaks or chattering.Look: changing wiper blades isn't *that* hard. But surely Bosch can do better with the instructions it provides (which is why this is a four-star instead of a five-star rating)."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I used for 1 day and and it destroyed itself with a pine needle.  Now I get streaks where the pine needle, or any other item I assume, has been dragged. So unless you are meticulous and clean your blades before you use them everyday and or get out of your car and clean them immediately anytime any item may fall onto your window, do not buy these.  Unless you do not mind streaks.  The damage is permanent, not only when the item is still on the window."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Sometimes I wish my car was BIGGER, just so I could wax even MORE of it with Meguiar's A-2216 Deep Crystal Carnuba Wax.This is a labor of love, (but not a frustrating exercise in removing powdered wax from trim and other areas, like it can be when you use other brands of car waxes). I find that using a spray bottle of water and lightly spritzing that portion of the car that I am Meguiar-waxing makes the shine even more intense.I usually wax the car twice, to get a very deep shine -- the first day I let the new wax coat settle, then the second day, hose down the car, dry it and Meugiar-Wax it again, for a beautiful deep finish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "this product is as good as the turtle platinun, carnauba mother step 3. and the price is lower and equal quality of the three brands, the brightness of the car depends on the quality of the painting and not the wax. for this reason the high prices of other products can not be justified, after several years of experience in this field I recommend Meguiar carnauba step 3, I recommend waxing every month depending on weather and if the car is exposed or not the sun .. or every two weeks and has not so abrasive that can be used many times as you want."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Meguiar's Deep Crystal line is meant as an inexpensive alternative to the more expensive Meguiar's product lines.  This liquid wax works very well, and contains Carnauba, but is not their best product.This product is Step 3 in the Deep Crystal line, and would be used after Step 1 (Wash) and Step 2 (Polish).  The product is applied by hand or dual action polisher then wiped off after it dries.  Very simple and effective.The \"look\" of this product is highly subjective, but it does not have the clarity or longevity of other Meguiar's waxes.  It should also be noted that this product has been discontinued, so don't get too addicted to it!  If you want a great carnauba wax from Meguiar's, look into Gold Class Carnauba Plus."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Want to enter your car in the Car Show/Rod Run but it's picked up a bit of Highway dust and dirt?Assuming they have a car wash area (and many outdoor car shows do), hose her off, dry her up and pick up the Meguiar's A3332 Quik Detailer Mist & Wipe Spray and some dry towels -- one quick application to the car will bring her back to good looking glossiness, and you most probably will pick up a few extra points when the judges come around.Meguiars makes great automotive finish products, and has been doing so for a long time."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been using Mequiar's Quik Detailer for years and it is still the best product I've found.  I've tried other brands including new ones to the market place, and this is still the leader.  One thing I really like about it is if I miss a spot, a quick spray and the surface is consistent in shine and appearance.  Some of the other sprays would be totally dependent on how much product you used, so I would have to go back and keep blending until the difference wasn't noticeable."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just bought this product after washing my new car for the first time.  I didn't take the time to dry it because I normally don't have issues with water spots but at my apartment my water is awful I guess.  Needless to say my car was destroyed with them.  Huge white nasty spots everywhere.  So I did some research and found this got good reviews so I gave it a shot and WOW.  It totally works on bad waterspots and brought them right out of the finish.  I was very impressed."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I just used this on my car and it does live up to the reviews listed below.  I think the labeling \"natural shine\" does in fact fit this product well.  It gave my car interior a nice \"showroom\" shine but not overly so.  It left the interior glossy and new looking but I would not describe it as greasy or shiny in a distracting way.  Very good product.  I recommend spraying directly onto a towel first so not to get it everywhere in your vehicle."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had already used the clay bars on my Corvette to clean the painted surface then I had applied a liquid polish my Mothers and the car looked very decent. I then applied the Meguiars Gold Class wax and the results were excellent. There is a pad in the container when made application easy and I just let it dry and then took a soft cloth and removed the wax coating. The result if a very nice looking surface. I will be putting a couple of more coats on the car before I take it to the next show. I ddi this by hand and perhaps all of this would have been easier if I had an electric polisher. I am now looking for that machine."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Yeah I'm a freak when it comes to my cars finish, I've used it all and don't get me wrong many great brands out there. This has to be considered with some of the best shy of the stupid expensive stuff which I just can't justify. This will shine like a Mother.....ops that's another brand...lol. Seriously lay one coat down and you'll be happy, then do a super light coat over that coat and wipe off with a light mist of water and prepare to be amazed !"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This was extremely easy to use.  I would do one side of the car and do the next while waiting for it to dry.  Then buff with a microfiber towel and you're good to go.  Came with an applicator, but I used my own pads.  I will keep that one with the tin if I'm ever in a pinch.  It left a great shine on the car that even still exists 2 weeks later after a trip across 2 states during some rain storms.  The only blemishes are the bugs I hit along the way.  Also, I have to park my car outside in the elements.  excellent wax!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "If I could bathe in this stuff, I probably would. I've used dozens of car shampoos over the last 20 years or so, and this Meguiar's Gold Class is definitely the best. It doesn't take much to get a nice cleansing foam going, and once you do, it applies and washes with an ultimate smoothness that I haven't been able to find with other soaps. And not that it matters, but it's also got a really great scent, which is a nice little bonus when you'd rather be doing other things besides washing your car."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Just washed my car for the first time since I've owned it (7 years). I've taken it through the washes, etc. but never WASHED it. So this shampoo is really good along with the special washing mitt. There is enough here for my grandchildren (had I ever had children but that is a total 'nuther story) at 4 capfuls per wash. I also used the clay by the same company, and their water magnet towel, and their shiner towels. I cannot speak highly enough! I am so very glad I bought this for what it was going to cost me for half the job a few blocks away. GET THE CLAY."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "So I pour in a good amount and mix it with water. In the bucket there is a lot of suds, but then when I apply it to the car, the suds don't carry over.To me, soap is just soap, however this soap has a nice smell to it.It doesn't remove dirt or debris any better than the next soap, however I used to use Rain X with Carnauba wax, and that was a great car wash soap. It left my car shiny after washing and this -- I have to wax it after. I bought this at Costco for like 12 dollars, and it lasted me quite a while. I wouldn't go back to this as it doesn't wax my car. Also -- it dries fairly quickly for some reason and leaves a soap residue."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff is good for cleaning and leaving a nice long lasting shine especially on dark vehicles ex: black, dark grey, red etc. Some reviews are correct is saying it doesn't hold suds, but you must understand that this product contains conditioners which will do that. Its best to use a bottle attached sprayer \"on hose\" with solution in it. This will make suds, suds, but want last as again it has conditioners in it. Product smells like hair shampoo, gold color doesn't make paint change in appearance either, some products after long use stays attached because of wax buildup can make your vehicle appear to look the color of stuff you are using. Good stuff, way better than Mothers. If it doesn't clean like you need then go get a bottle of blue dawn detergent."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This product is great on tires!!!! It's not runny and sticks well to the tires. For some reason it smells great to? Anyhow, wear some latex gloves and use a sponge like applicator to apply the gel. After a couple uses your tires will have soaked it in to the point that you will only need to use a dirty rag to wipe the dust and grime off the tires and they will actually still have a shine!! I recommend this product....&#34;PS works great on exterior trim as well.&#34;Dec. 16, 2013"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "excellent product, i tried several products on my rims, this really does the job well, i sprayed it liberally to rims wells and outside used brush only on inside wells , but didn't have to brush the outside of the rim, and the rim became  totally clean with just water hose rinse, strong but yet no complications from the product, what i mean is that i noticed its safe on the rims.the only disadvantage is that the bottle was enough for one time clean only, so for proper clean i think you needs 2 bottles, if you want to clean properly including the wells behind the spokes."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use it on every wash that I do.If your a car guy and keep your vehicles nice this is a great product.If your working on a vehicle that has been abused it may take you two or three times to get the wheels looking good.You may have to scrub the wheels by hand to clean off the real dirty areas, and possibly use tar and or bug remover to get them nice and clean.But once you do that, from there in all you need to do is wash the wheels down, spray the wheel cleaner on and let it sit for a few minutes and pressure wash it off. No need to hand wash.And the wheels look really nice."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been trying lots of brake dust cleaners and this one is about the best one I've used so far. I like it because it's not expensive and available at most discount stores.  I have found that I have to use my wheel brush to completely remove the brake dust and as I agitate the solution, it seems to become jelly like.  When this happens, I've learned to rinse off immediately.  If the wheel doesn't become complete clean, I have to repeat the process.  I always wash my wheels first before I start washing the car's body.  I have used lots of Meguiar's products and have been very satisfied."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I really like this product. Although I prefer the 3M tire restorer, it happens to be extremely expensive, so I just use this Meguiar's. It gives a really good shine and I also used it on plastics -they become really black, trust me.Note: Some people give this 3 or 4 stars because \"it stains\" or \"doesn't last long\" this is ludicrous. On my car it does hold up at least 3 weeks to a month easy. You can expect it to last for a year. Same thing with staining the pavement -most of this product do, is normal. For the price this is the best product out there"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "i bought it thinking it was shinier than the cheaper ones that come in a spray canister. i was wrong they are pretty much the same. and little annoying things like not properly labeling the nozzle to let you know if your spraying wide or narrow is a pain. you have to spray to know whether the on setting is narrow or wide. this is my first week using it and i gotta tell yah this thing doesn't look like its going to last, even gingerly spraying this on my tire is wasting the spray at an alarming rate. i don't know if its just my bottle that came a little cracked but whenever i spray somehow someway the liquid leaks through the openings and gets all over my hands.other than that, the seller is fast and the package came in good condition."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I had purchased two of these drying towels as I had read that these may not work as well as advertised. WAS I WRONG! The towel easily soaked up all the water that was coming off the car, leaving it spotless. I had a friend help me with the second towel and I was able to dry my car in record time and not have any water marks left on the paint. I just slid the towel over any parts with water and it left no trace of water and a clean shine to my car."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Yes it is a water magnet;however like another reviewer said, it's so magnetic where it won't let the water go no matter however many times you wring it. Sure drops will come off, but the potency of drying will not be at 100% as if the towel was completely dry. I would recommend a chamois or an absorber, they seems to wring out water alot better as well as soak water up. Just figure out a technique. And victory will be yours. So the case of the drying water magnet, I'll give it a four since it does what it's title says. And a bit easier to use than the chamois. But you get what you pay for."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This towel works great at drying off my car. I've tried several versions of chamois before and it just has never worked for me, I found that this towel it works best if the water is blown off or taken for a quick drive to allow some water to fly off. I typically use it after a drive thru car wash and the towels does a great job of soaking up whatever is left very quickly and without streaking. It can easily do 10 cars this way before it gets too soaked up. Now I've also used it after washing in my driveway and gotten the towel completely soaked. It worked fine too but did not wring out too well. I would say one towel for one car this way. I'll be ordering a second one soon."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I am amazed at how much water these towels will absorb and when I dry my car, it leaves it streak free.  The waffle weave design of this towel holds a remarkable amount of water when I'm drying my car. After washing my car, I squeegee off the excess water and then I used the water magnet towel. I can dry the entire car to perfection and never have to wring out the towel. I only occasionally wash this towel and only with plain laundry detergent that contains no fabric softeners or additives.  I consider this to be my prize drying towel."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Okay so I'm sure everyone has their preferences. I haven't tried everyone on the market - but of the ones I have, these are the best. I try not touch my exterior of my car with anything, but if I have to these are the only ones I trust. They are the softest and thickest Microfiber I have ever owned. I use them more regularly for wiping down my interior, windows, and mirrors. They wash well, and there's no left over tag bits or rough parts on the towel. Meguiar always has great products, IMO."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "At about 3 bucks a piece they are an excellent buy. As all the other 5 star reviews have noted, they are soft and versatile. They do an amazing job on windows and mirrors. They are 16x24.I rated them 5 stars because they are excellent and an excellent value too.If you are looking for the next level, or you really want something dedicated to just babying your paint job, then these Cobra towels (  Cobra Miracle Towel 6 Pack ***NEW*** ) are pretty awesome. These towels run about $7.80 each with shipping, they're plusher, 70/30 towels and although they are the same size, 16x24, they seem a lot bigger and they feel much nicer.Darin"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I was going to buy a few of these but found them priced $3 lower for the 3 packs on another online dealer....that's why i took off a star.I love these towels, they are the right size to buff my cars when using a detail spray or spray wax. You can fold over several times when detailing your car....It has the right thickness to wipe up detail spray or spray wax. It can also clean glass to a crytal clear finish with just water & a lil vinegar.If you're serious about making your car look fantastic, you need to get these."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased these microfiber cloths because of all the good reviews, and I needed a couple cloths - very handy to have around. The quality of the cloths are ok, and does a decent job at cleaning.  I am not sure how long these cloths will last after multiple washes as the quality is average.  So far they work just fine, but just think they are some less expensive options for the quality.  I wish someone made some high-end cloths that could work inside my car and on my iPhone."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "These are thick and well-made, and provide smooth application of wax on your car.  On the down side--because they are so thick, they absorb a lot of wax that just ends up being washed out of the pad after use.  Also, I did soak the pad overnight because it was a little dirty after using it all over my car.  It still hasn't cleaned out all of the dirt and excess wax.  I'll see how it looks after washing it in my washing machine."}

These dont make any squeaks and clean water away from glass well even under torential Florida rain.

{"label": 2, "raw": "I used Zym&ouml;l Z503 on a newer vehicle that had minor contaminants in the finish.One characteristic that is important to note about Zym&ouml;l is that you need to be a bit more synchronized w/ its application - it dries really fast compared to other cleaner waxes I've used.This cleaner wax requires more effort to buff clean. The extra amount of elbow-grease required resulted in a superior shine.PROS:1. natural formula2. solid reputation3. provides intense 'wet' shine4. cleans off concrete easily (inevitable drip or two on the garage floor)5. smells like tropical paradiseCONS:1. very thin consistencyI'm not sure if the Zym&ouml;l Z503 is the same formula that I've used in years past, that said I'll wait a while to evaluate how long the protective finish lasts."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try."}

I was replacing one with individual felt slots to store DVD's without the cases.  Can't do that here.The zippers open very easily though, and the mesh works great for a garage door opener.  I use the sunglasses spot for my gas card and gift cards.I like the adjustable straps since I have slightly larger than normal visors on my 2012 Nissan Juke and the one I was replacing was elastic straps that barely fit over it.  I kept waiting for them to snap and fall off.So as long as you only have a few things to get out of the way, this works alright."}

I got the California Car Duster as an easy fix to rid the dust and it dusts sooo beautifully! The first time use left a bunch of red dust threads on my Jeep, but after a few uses, it went away.I have it sitting in the cargo area of my Jeep because black is so hard to keep clean!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "You get just what you think you'll get with these cheap mats from Rubber Queen.  They are thin and look similar to OEM mats, albeit without a custom shape or buttons to snap into place.  The thinness may mean that they will wear out relatively quickly, but it also makes them unobtrusive.  Thick mats can take some time to adapt to, since my feet are in a different position relative to the gas and brake pedals.In terms of color, the black fits with my generic black flooring well enough to be practically invisible, which is great.  Overall, a good value and I won't feel too bad about throwing them away if they become too messy to clean."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Amazon doesn't sell this plug for my Subaru.  I'm putting it here as a public service.  I had four of these in my Subaru for 50000 miles.  They worked fine.  Except one had the whole corner of the ground electrode shear off.  I don't know if it's still in the cylinder or not, but the whole corner is cleanly gone. Overall, there's not much wear on the ground electrode.  The spark was grounding almost on the side of the electrode after that part of the electrode sheared off.  Not good.  And I still wonder if I don't need to stick a magnet on a stick down the spark plug hole and try to get that piece back.Anyway, the laser iridium probably solves this as the ground electrode has a platinum disk on it."}

No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as \"Ultimate performance\" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  \"NGK spark plug finder\" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps."}

I want to pull into my site, and sit right in my seat at the leveling controls and do everything right there.  I installed extra level bubbles around the driver so all my rough leveling is done, and THEN I can walk around and fine-tune it at the back.My only warning to buyers:  make SURE you have them exactly where you want them before pressing on.  They DON'T move or come back off.  It's actually difficult to set them prefect on the first try because they stick so well.  Use a good carpenter's level to get the RV straight, then hold these steady with both hands and place CAREFULLY.  I'm kinda shaky so I really had to brace my hands on the RV while setting them."}

I first would get the left to right correct with drive on leggo block wheel lift and chocks and then work the electric jack to get the front to back.  No more fooling around with going inside the RV and checking with a level any more.  I epoxied mine in place after they had set over night and had not changed before doing so.  I used JB 10 minute epoxy to do this."}

Remember to stir the contents well and use only a very small amount. I tend to use a disposable acid brush for application, rather than the lid mounted brush. In fact, I tend to remove the included brush and prefer to just have the lid as a lid.  It has never failed me. I would use a copper based product for exhaust work, but this works well for all other fasteners. It also cleans up easy."}

{"label": 2, "raw": "Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces. Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works. I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go. This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more. The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product. You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle. Don't wait like I did. Order this NOW!!! As usual Amazon came through with the shipping. If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me. Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck."}

I bought this and mounted it permanently in my car and when I get the occasional sensor code I can handily reset the code and continue on my merry way.  Having all of the other information available is so convenient and the manual is user friendly.  I love this and want one for all of my vehicles."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I saw a review on Mojo channel where the reviewer used the MPG display to increase mileage.Based on this I bought one and I'm not disappointed.I can see this easily paying for itself in less than a year.The real time MPG display allows you to tame that lead foot and get awesome mileage on a long run.I did an 8 hour drive last week and must have got conservatively 5MPG better fuel economy. You do have to work at viewing the display and feeding it back to that right foot. Very easy to install - under 5 minutes.If you're not a gadget fan then don't buy it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I found Permatex at Advance Auto and have been very pleased with it's performance.I used to use Devcon bulb grease for many years until I finished the tubeand could no longer find it locally.Besides the many great used for automobiles, this grease resolves problems with light bulbsin the house being hard to turn and or breaking off in sockets, and is perfect for oven light bulbs.It only takes a tiny bit each time, about 1/16\" bead of grease spread on the bulb threads.A tube (.33 oz) lasts a long time. If used for household only, probably several years!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I put this on almost everything that has an electrical connection. WAY&#8230; Way&#8230; Cheaper purchasing this tune then buying little packets every time a bulb needs to be replaced, or spark plugs.When I change plugs I put this on, fixed a poor radio connection putting this in the plug (Never flickers, or turns off now), putting some on bulbs insures an easy removal in the future. If you have had a stuck bulb you know what I'm talking about.Great stuff every one should have some laying around!"}

I changed the plugs and wires with the help of this tune up grease and reset the average MPG, within 10 days my average is up to 14.8.I did NOTHING to the vehicle other than install wires and the plugs.This grease helps ensure a good, insulated connection and is a must for a little job like this which can make a difference in your mileage.this is a big tube and will last you a lifetime."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This Permatex Dielectric grease works great to seal out dust & dirt. I used it on my mower spark plug boots as I have a few areas of the yard that kick up a good bit of dust when I drive over them and this applied correctly makes a great seal between the boot and the plug to keep the plug clean and thus a good high spark going to the engine. If you want to use it on smaller items, you may need an appropriate applicator as it only comes with the &#34;toothpaste&#34; style opening and that's not for finesse. I highly recommend this product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Use this goop on trailer line connections and when you replace a bulb in any application where moisture is likely.  My Tracker boat trailer has incandescent bulbs and they are encapsulated in nearly water-tight containers, but they do get water within.  They are not meant to be 100% tight so if you replace a bulb, be sure to add some of this stuff to the socket.  Also, the true thief of light is corrosion, not bulb extinction, so apply some wherever there is a vulnerable spot.When changing spark plugs, along with the application of anti seize on the plug threads, use some dielectric grease at the junction of the coil pack and valve cover gasket and at the wire to coil pack."}

These 6x6s have typically been outside for a long time, and while they dont have a lot of highway miles, they sure do have UV damage and rust.  I have 9 windows and 4 doors with gaskets that are really expensive to replace.  Smear this grease on and the gaskets are generally good as new.  I use it on all hoses and gasketed electrical connections."}

So by the time I received it, the car was gone and I never used it.... if you want one for free, I've got it, just pay shipping. It is perfect match for the 2007 Buick silver.However that funny part was, the actual paint and applicator is great.  It is small, compact, easy to use, and the colors if matched from the factory name and number are used, it will be VERY close for any color you may select for any vehicle produced!  Buy knowing that it works and works well.  Enjoy."}

I am spoiled by the nice struts on my 96 XJ, so I bought a set of the Strongarm struts here on Amazon due to many positive reviews here and in Cherokeeforum.com. I put these on the Jeep in about 20 minutes and all it took was a small flat-head screwdriver and a 10mm socket. It was way easier than I expected! I used an adjustable backcountry ski pole to hold the hatch up while I did the work and it worked just fine. The hatch now goes up and stays up all by itself and works perfectly so I'm extremely satisfied with the fit and function as well as the sweet deal for a pair of new ones here on amazon."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I was rebuilding a wear ring on a sportjet engine and needed to cover a large area with jbweld, make it perfectly smooth and even. Took 3 passes to get a perfectly smooth surface and it's stronger than the original! The tubes are really big too, I didn't even use 1/2 yet and you can sand it and shape it. My advise would be to use it sparingly if you need to get exact dimensions because this stuff gets VERY hard, sanding it by hand is hopeless for anything other than fine grit sandpaper. Also, rough sand between applications because it turns smooth, almost glass-like when it dries so you have to sand between the layers to make sure it doesn't flake. I used a dremel ultrasonic sander with rough paper to get the dimensions right and then hand sanded for smoothness only"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have been washing all my cars for years with Turtle Wax Car Wash and have always been satisfied with this Turtle Wax products.When I bought this product, Turtle Wax ZIP CarWax, I was really disappointed about its wash performance :- the &#34;concentrate&#34; in the bottle is very watery to begin with; no comparison to Turtle Wax's original ZIP car wash- even though I used 1 fl. oz. (~ 30 ml) with a bucket of water this product does not generate any suds- because of this it is tough to get grime and dirt off; you have to scrub really hardI am baffled that this product has so many positive reviews; maybe Turtle wax recently has changed the formula for this product, and I got the newest version."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Once a year seems pretty accurate. I'm sure it varies on where you live, how dirty your car gets, how often you wash it, how you wash it, what detergent you use, etc., etc. But it was highly rated by Consumer Reports so I figured I'd give it a shot. Goes on, wipes off easy - or about the same as other paste waxes I've used. Oh, and yes, this is a polish not a cleaner. If your paint is really dirty, faded, etc, then you need to use a cleaner first then a polish. Put it on thin, in the shade, keep it off plastic, use a microfiber cloth - in other words follow the directions and use it correctly and it works great. And, yes, if you have chips in your paint they will turn white - just like with any other polish."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Meguiar's Quik is cheap, which is great as long as your interior is already pretty clean. It has no intrinsic cleaning power of it's own beyond that of water. In other words, it will clean exactly as well as a damp cloth. Any dirt that can't be lifted with a damp cloth will stay put. It does have a nice scent, which dissipates in a matter of hours. You'll probably want a more effective product if your car gets a lot of use and/or carries many passengers."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I really like this product. It is not shiny and doesn't smell chemically like some products. (names unmentioned) It dries to a flat finish and doesn't leave any greasy feel to it like (unmentioned again).Does not appear to build up like \"other\" products, but, I've only been using it for about 6 months but will definitely buy and use more when needed. It is great for navigation/audio/video screens too!!! I don't use it on leather as I have cleaners/moisturizers for that, but, otherwise I use this on all but the headliner.My interior is black all over and any spec of dust shows up and is very noticeable. This stuff cleans all of the dust and anything that may have stained w/out issue. Again, no film and no buildup. The non-greasy finish is the most appealing part of this product and the smell is an added plus."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "A few sprays and a wipe down with a microfiber cloth and the interior of my car looks like I just detailed it. Of course, you have to detail the car first. It's not a miracle worker. But when you want to get back to the detail look without major effort, this is the way to go. I keep the bottle and some clothes in my trunk on club rides.Compared to heavier interior cleaners, like Armorall, this stuff doesn't get oily residue on your windows. It doesn't wipe off glass completely clean but over spray comes off with just a little window cleaner."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I'm a skeptic when a product promises spectacular results with a minimum of effort, but this one delivers!  The light gray interior of my car looks brand new, and it took less than half an hour.  I have leather seats, too.  Finger marks, dust,  insect carcasses, spilled drink stains--all are history.  The only thing it didn't fully remove was a blue ink mark, but even that is lighter.My only regret is that the really lovely rose fragrance didn't linger, but oh, well."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I use a lot of Meguires products. This product turned my dash board splotchy and brown in spots. I went over the cart a few times to  make sure the product was being absorbed evenly. It made no difference. The plastic on my console shifter indicator also turn blotchy. I waited a day and then went over everything with Meguiars #40 Vinyl and Rubber conditioner and everything turned out great. I believe the #40 is a much better product at least on my car. I called Meguires and told them what happened. They told me the #40 has as much uv protection as the Quick Detailer. They had no explanation as to why I had bad results.The plastic on my console is still blotchy but I will try some plastic lens polish to try and fix that. Just glad I didn't use this on my instrument panel."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've been using diluted (10 to 1) Simple Green to clean the interior of my cars for many years. It works on nearly any surface except glass.  It's also cheap and smells pleasant (at least to my unrefined sniffer).  I decided to buy this Meguiars interior detailed just to compare it with Simple Green.  I love Meguiars Gold class exterior spray detailed - the stuff is just amazing.  I also use Meguiars cleaner wax on my cars.There is absolutely nothing wrong with this product.  It does exactly what it says it should do.  I give it 4 stars for function and quality.  My gripe is that is doesn't really work any better than something 1/5 it's price.  I'll probably stick with Simple Green and skip buying this again."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have owned these for about 8 years now.  They have held up very well.  No bend or flex ever noticed.  I use them for any under-car work that doesn't require the wheels being removed.  They are light, and easy to store by hanging them off a screw using the hole they already have built in.To the reviews that say they slide a lot: you need to have a gentle foot on the gas pedal.  If you try to drive up the ramps fast, you may push the ramp.  Take your time, be smooth with the gas, and you'll get up ok.Note if you own a low-riding sports car, the angle of these might not be low enough for you.  The easy solution to that problem is to take something like a 1\"x10\" board and butt it against the ramp.  Drive up on the wood first then continue onto the ramp.For the price, these are an A+ purchase!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "They're light, they're tough, they work.  I have no qualms with sliding under my car when they're on these ramps.HOWEVER -- Because they're light, you want to use them only with drive wheels, otherwise they won't stay in place as you climb the ramps.  And because they're light, I'd advise using them only with smaller vehicles.  Honda Civic?  Yes.  Crown Vic?  No.And regardless of what kind of ramp I use, I always position an extra floor jack under the car \"just in case\"."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Bought this after my wife ran over a screw.  Didn't have one at the time so I had to use my father's set.  Well surprise, she ran over another screw somehow last week and I pulled this bad boy out and plugged that hole right up without having to even put on the spare.People say you're supposed to have the holes professionally patched at a dealer, but if the hole isn't any kind of tear and is just a puncture, I have never had any issues with plugs falling out after 1000's of miles of driving."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This, my second kit, came from Amazon. I bought the first kit locally when I walked into my garage and saw a flat tire on the Honda CRV. I took the tire off the car, used a water bottle to find the air bubbles escaping the hole, followed the directions and repaired the flat. It took a little muscle to enlarge the hole and insert the plug. I cut off the excess plug and used a jump box  with an air compressor (that I periodically keep in the car)  to inflate the tire.Good thing the hole was in the tread. These kits won't work if the hole is in the sidewall.These kits pay for themselves with one use in time, money and frustration. Flats can cost $10 -15 to fix. I keep one in both cars.The jump box prevented tire damage because I didn't have to drive it to a gas station to be inflated."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Slime is a really great product.  You can use it on any tire from your garden tiller to your SUV.  The bottles come in different sizes to cover a range of tire sizes.  You need to own some sort of tire pump to apply this product to the tire and usually that means some sort of air compressor.  A bicycle pump will work for bike tires, though.Slime doesn't have a pressurized propellant in the bottle, so there's no danger to you or to a tire technician.  It can be a little messy if you decide to remove a tire from its rim.  A small price to pay for a safe and effective product."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this for my 4-wheeler. I have a K&N filter on my truck and it has performed real well. Just take an air hose and clean it instead of buying another one. I'm hoping to get the same service out of this one too. Every-time I have my 4-wheeler service, they change my air filter. Well.........those little filters are fairly expensive. I figure I can save a little over some time as far as the filter is concerned.........plus K&N has a pretty good reputation. I would recommend this to anyone wanting such an item."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have a K&N in my car so I decided to add this to the girlfriends.  She has a 2006 Toyota Matrix. It fits snug, but that means there's a good seal. Her stock filter was horribly dirty after just one year, so it'll be interesting how this holds up. It's impossible to tell if there is any improvement in performance. I don't drive it daily so I'm not sure about the gas mileage either. Buy this for its reusability, not its performance. My only complaint is the little \"Do Not Discard\" sticker isn't sticky enough to attach to the air box."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have used K&N; for years in my vehicles so when it was time to change the Air Filter in our 2003 Toyota Corolla, it was K&N; time again. Now this filter is about 3 times the price of a cheap paper one, but they really do last 100,000 miles before they need to be cleaned. Do they improve mileage? I think they do, but they also improve performance slightly, so unless you have a light right foot you probably wont see much of a difference. When I do notice the gas savings is on the long freeway runs.One thing, when fitting it be careful, the old paper filters will fit in either way around, but the K&N; has 2 nubs on it that make it directional. If you put it in the wrong way around the lid just won't get close enough to close the clips, but rotate it so the nubs are facing the front of the car and the lid will fit perfectly."}

This wax is a paste and is easy to apply with a slightly damp cloth or applicator. I am currently using it on my boat and cars. I would suggest working a smaller area to avoid the wax drying and becoming harder to remove. If you stay in a 2x2 or so section it is easy to put on and take off. It leaves a very slick surface and a good shine. If you use a carwash soap for cleaning, the wax will remain for quite some time. I have noticed it seems to hold up well on the boat in saltwater as well. That says a lot for anything in the Florida sun."}

In cars without it, I usually see black gunk spill back out of the fuel filter.  This is not a cure-all in a single serving bottle.  But if used regularly, over time, you will see results."}

I added a full bottle to the transfer case (which was leaking the most) and a bit to the transmission sump; they are interconnected, but have separate fill and drain holes.  It was very difficult to get into the fill holes because of the viscosity of the stuff (about the consistency of molasses).  I drove around today, about 40 miles or so, and both the transfer case and the transmission still leak about the same as when I put it in.  I cannot recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a  leaky transmission."}

They worked well with my 22 foot travel trailer, but now we have a 30 foot travel trailer, and they don't offer as much rear viewing sight. I will have to go to the factory extended mirrors. Which I kinda of expected that. For the money they do well!If you will do a lot of towing, and in busy areas, I would recommend the factory extended mirrors. They cost more, but may be worth the extra, as compared to side swiping someone! I think for as much as they do extend, they could of been a little larger, just my two cents worth."}

At the same time that I was doing this, I also PlastiDipped my rims a bright white (my Grand Am GT coupe is white as well.)

As you can see by it's picture, the cap is threaded to the bottom which is NOT the same as Toyota's OEM cap, which is smooth for about a half inch to make replacing the cap after filling the tank easier.I had to call Stant to make sure this would fit on my 2012 as the Amazon guide indicated it would not. I does fit but is not as slick as the original. Some online reviews and the Toyota manual warn about a \"check engine\" light if the gas tank is not properly sealed by the cap. That was not an issue with mine.I'd spend more money and buy one that fit better if it was available but from my research I couldn't find one."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "As you may know, one cause of the \"check engine light\" coming on your dash is lack of pressure in the fuel system due to a faulty gas cap.Normally, when the \"check engine light\" comes on, I go out and tighten the gas cap; if that's the cause, the light will go off in an hour or so.However, if the light stays on, a cheap option is to replace the gas cap - a lot cheaper than taking it to the shop and getting charged an hour of labor and the shop cost of a gas cap. In my state, a car with the \"check engine\" light on during the inspection period will fail the inspection.If you replace the cap, and the light still stays on, then take it to the shop.This is a good price on the cap."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Amazon never fails to amaze me of the various range of products that they have. I got lucky and was able to buy this pack in Amazon warehouse deals for the price lower than Pepboys and Autozone. I really can't feel its effect on the gas mileage in our Corolla but I have sensed its increase in power. I also checked the engine oil at least once a week and you can definitely see the difference compared to the oil placed by another shop who did my previous oil change.The oil is a little bit expensive but it is definitely worth if for the machine that carries me and my family."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I highly recommend Mobil synthetic 5w-30 and 10w-30.  I have been using it in all of my cars, ATV, home generator, and 10w-30 in my trucks since 1990 and all who have worked on my engines comment how clean they have been. All quick to start in Montana cold weather, always better MPG than manufacturer stated, never overheating, and no oil consumption with age.  I recommend starting from the beginning with your vehicle.  It is an excellent product, even recommended adding a little to your chain saw bar-oil for all season cutting, especially cold weather when bar oil can gum-up."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This was the first oil change for my 2013 Elantra GT.  I had the i30 in Europe and this is the oil I used there.  The manual says 5W-30 or 20... but this has a wider range.I let the first 2500 miles to go on the original oil.  Just had the oil changed at the dealer and as always, this oil will never fails... you can feel the smooth engine sound and smoother engine grip.  I have a manual so revving the engine in gears i can clearly hear a difference.And by the way, this is the same oil that goes into my A4 for that past 5 years (5 oil changes).  just buy it and never look back."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It is a mystery how such a thin towel can absorb so much water. I know it is the waffle weave that allows the towel to guzzle up so much water... but I can dry a section of my SUV and wring out the towel and then dry another section without having to wait.This towel is a tad expensive and there are other waffle weave towels available, but this makes the drying process for my vehicle take much less time. I simply use the water sheeting technique and this Supreme Guzzler. No blower or anything else!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I've always been a fan of using the Absorber products for drying my cars. I really hated wringing it out over and over to remove the water from the product. I was amazed at the amount of water this thing sucked up. In drying my Honda Pilot, not once did I, or COULD I wring out any water. Very soft, and no issues with scratching.I was somewhat confused about which one I should buy, until I found this breakdown:Cobra Supreme - application of waxes, quick detailers and buffingCobra Miracle Towel - wax and polish removal, buffingCobra Deluxe - application of spray waxes, quick detailers, buffingCobra Gold Plush - application of spray waxes, quick detailers, buffingCobra Guzzler Waffle - dryingCobra Guzzler HD Waffle - dryingCobra Waffle Weave Glass - cleaning glassNow I just need to get some of their other products!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This thing really does work excellent.  I used it to cycle out old gas in plastic cans into my car.  The new CARB compliant cans take forever to pour because they don't have a pressure hole.  I put the can on the trunk of the car, and put the siphon in each end.  A couple of shakes, and it started flowing until it was empty.  It took about 3 minutes for 5 gallons.What it didn't work for was trying to siphon gas out of my generator back into a gas can.  The gas tank was too shallow and there wasn't enough room to shake the siphon to get a good flow.  If you have a pump with deflate on it, you can still use this to get it started."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I purchased this to siphon fuel from my generator, and this tube is too large to even access the neck of the tank.  Also, this siphon is for containers that have lots of liquid, as you need to use up and down thrusting motion to start the priming process. So, a small generator wouldn't have enough liquid in it, and also not enough clearance to accept this siphon.  But, for large containers with lots of liquid this will absolutely work.UPDATE:  I was able to actually use this in my generator afterall.  I had to insert the hose at an angle to reach a certain part of the gas tank and it worked like a charm. But, you need to use the up/down motion really really fast to start it off and then it will siphon. I guess it takes a little practice and a little patience. Once you get it right you'll have no problem doing the next time. I keep this in my truck now in case I ever need it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I always buy a few hoses, two 10 footers and a 15 ft hose. I then connect together the best combination lenth hose that will get from water source to RV. Keeps my camp area neat, plus why on hot days would I want the sun heat the water in the hose and have to wait for the water to get cool by running it. Just makes more sense adding what ya need together then 30 ft of hose sprawel out on your camp site. Most campsites you will end up using the 15 footer anyway."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Bought this to use for a camper, It works as a hose, but the ends are plastic.  Initially, I didn't have a problem with this, but at one campground the end was fused to the spigot at my campsite.  I had to use a wrench to get it to release, this damaged the end and I had to buy a new hose.  Also, before this happened it was difficult to get the hose to not leak through the connection.  Defnitely, I recommend getting a hose with metal ends."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Great way to keep your tongue jack from resting on wet ground or concrete, likely extending the life by not letting it rust out so quick.  Using with a tow package that includes a weight distribution assembly can prove problematic for smaller SUV's/cars though (tested with a 2008 Ford Escape with Class 3 hitch), as the tongue jack stand is so tall that you have to sometimes jack up your car up to clear it!  Still, I can't fault the jack stand for that.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I bought this jack stand to replace the assortment of wood blocks that I used under the front tongue of our 20' camper, weight about 500lbs,  when parked at the storage lot or while out camping.  By the second season the base had fatigued and cracked in a circular manner and by the third season I had to remove it from service because I felt it would not safely hold the weight of the tongue.  I was pretty disappointed considering how much I spent and inconvenient is was to store away.  I've moved on to the &#34;Flip-foot&#34; jack extension."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I read all the other companies material on how well their products worked on rust. I had planned on using the POR product but as with several other ones I was worried about how harsh and toxic they were. This product is  water based no harsh fumes and cleans up with water! So far I have used almost two bottles on a very rusty undercarriage. The product works fantastic, isn't scary to handle and the finished results are beautiful. You have to recoat in about twenty min. for the coverage to even out. In 24hours it dries to a hard satin black finish which you can top coat. This product  goes a long way for such a small bottle. A great buy!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Some hardware stores carry this in 8 oz. containers.  It is a buck or two cheaper to order it here and have it delivered.  It works better than naval jelly.  Not particularly recommended for show quality applications.I pour a little our on a 2&#34; paint brush to coat rusted ferrous metal.It stops rust and turns it black.Good for tools and equipment that have a tendency to rust.It is thicker that some of the phosphoric acid products and leaves a coating that can be painted over.I am using it on a rusty utility trailer and an old tractor.You don't have to paint it but you can.It kills the rust."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Purchased this aerosol can when I was about to renovate a couple of corroding, outdoor light fixtures.  After completely taking the light fixtures apart, and using a bit of elbow grease with a wire brush, cleaned the parts, we applied the Permatex Rust Treatment.  Lo and behold, the rust disappeared and a black coating emerged.  Afterwards, we applied a coat of U-POL ACID #8 Etch Primer and two finishing coats of Rust-Oleum, turning the aging light fixtures in brand new ones."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This dries clear.  First time using this and only because I could not find rustoleum rust reformer red can.  I may not be being fair to this brand since I just began testing it.  I just prefer rustoleum because it has acceptable anti-rust capabilities and already is black.I sprayed this on some parts of 1996 truck as well as on a metal plate.  Rusty but no rust flakes.  Then metal plate was finished with 2 coats of rustoleum high temp semi gloss.  I'll see what happens.I use the rust converter mainly on underbody of the truck as rust treatment and a finish.  I am not really looking for a long term or a permanent fix."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "these look GREAT when mounted, and have been mounted for 6 months with stuff occasionally bumping them without falling off the side of my truck. the glow in the dark nub is removable thankfully, as the orange color is enough to find them in the dark. I tested these at the junkyard to see if they would \"actually\" work (i was skeptical) and my hand fell through the window after it, it took so little pressure. my girlfriend didnt even know I had broken it myself, since she was looking away and only saw the aftermath. I feel very re=assured with these next to me in my truck, and will buy them for any other vehicle I ever own, without a doubt."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "Got one of these mounted in my vehicle. Seems to have a quality build and a ok mount. Makes install a little easier, just remember that you'll have to get to this ASAP is something does happen so mount it somewhere you'll be able to get to even if you're upside down. ( Hopefully never ) This is just another one of those \"just incase\" tools that you carry and hope you never need. But better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This is the second style that I have bought on Amazon. The first one was like a toy. This one is close to it. Neither one was built STRONG. The handle is just a little longer than the last two I bought. Another thing. I just bought these  two at $10.00 each. Now, one week later, $15.00 almost? Sorry barely worth $10.00. I would shop for a better model. Sorry, I'm not ready yet to bust out a real car window to see if the thing will hold up??  Read my other product reviews folks. I'm just like YOU. I try to stretch that hard earned dollar.  SW"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "because I ordered this device along with a backup camera for my RV.  However, when I went to install the backup camera, their instructions said not to install it if there is a back up alarm installed.  The only reason that I could think of was that the current draw of both the camera and the alarm my exceed the fuse capacity of the backup lights and cause it to fail.  Anyway, I am further researching this and hope to get this resolved soon.  So the product looks good and is well packaged.  But I have not tried it yet."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I have no doubt that this oil is good oil. I do however doubt that the 50-70% price increase above other high quality synthetic oils, is not worth it. I can purchase castrol edge with titanium, mobil 1 EP or Pennzoil Ultra from my local walmart for $26.00/5 qt. The cheapest you can find 5 qts of 5w30 RP is around $43.00, 65% more expensive. This might be worth it for a track car, but no way is it worth it in 99% of consumer cars."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I watched videos and read literature from so many oil manufacturers that I thought my head was going to explode. In the end, I settled on Royal Purple. I use it exclusively in my 2012 Nissan Frontier 4x4 (4.0 V6). There is certainly a lot of hype out there regarding this oil, and it may be just that....hype. However, I've done enough research to feel comfortable paying a little extra for this oil, and Amazon sells it for an unbeatable price (comapred to anywhere in Warner Robins, GA). My truck &#34;seems&#34; to love it (I'm not really sure what that means), and Bobby Likis swears by it. Two thumbs up from this guy!"}
{"label": 2, "raw": "This stuff is amazing.  I bought it when RP was running a special; buy the oil, get the RP filter for free.  I was very surprised at how much difference it made over regular oil.  My engine runs a lot smoother and quieter.  I will be buying again.  Next time I think I will buy the high mileage version.  I just hope RP has another special so I don't have to pay for the matching RP filter $$.Update:  After a little over 4 months and 5,000 miles I changed my RP oil.  It looked almost as good as new oil; just a little browner.  When I had tried to do the same with house oil from the parts store it was shockingly dark; almost black.  RP has earned a life-long convert and RP evangelist."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "It is a little too early to tell, but this oil really smoothed out my Honda CR-V when idling.  I am not sure if it was because it was really in need of an oil change (any oil), our the synthetic nature of Royal Purple; I dont drive the CR-V as much, so I cant tell. I also used it in my Odyssey (what I normally drive) and I the engine is super quiet and purring like a kitten.  I get that there is a lot of marketing and hype with products, but this really seemed to improve the cars' performance."}
{"label": 2, "raw": "I haven't used the product yet, but I'm sure it'll do its job relatively well when it comes to plugging up tread holes for a temporary fix. At the same time, it would probably be much better to just buy a tire plugging kit and have a little bit of know-how if you are physically capable. I bought this for my brother, who is a new driver and does not know how to replace a tire. It's in the trunk in case he ever blows a tire the &#34;right&#34; way."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This book is such a life saver.  It has been so helpful to be able to go back to track trends, answer pediatrician questions, or communicate with each other when you are up at different times of the night with a newborn.  I think it is one of those things that everyone should be required to have before they leave the hospital.  We went through all the pages of the newborn version, then moved to the infant version, and will finish up the second infant book (third total) right as our baby turns 1.  See other things that are must haves for baby at [...]"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wanted to love this, but it was pretty expensive for only a few months worth of calendar pages.  I ended up buying a regular weekly planner - 55% OFF! - The Planner - that is 8 1/2 x 11 and has all seven days on the right page and the left page has room to write a To Do List and Goals.  I found this to be more helpful because I could mark each day's eating and sleeping blocks, then also see them side by side - I could see her patterns more easily with a weekly view.  This planner was cute, just not what I wanted."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Baby Tracker brand books are the absolute best of the trackers that are available. You can track naps, feedings, diaper changes, activities, and notes. They're easy to use and have a nice clean layout.I started using the Newborn Baby Tracker, which tracks nights and days. It gave me a nice way to track feedings and note important milestones. Once I used up the entire book, I bought this Baby Tracker, which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now. Her caregiver notes her activities and sleeping times during the day. It's a great way for me to know what happened. Plus, it's nice to be able to look back and see patterns or trends."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I use this so that our babysitter (grandma) can keep track of what goes on during the day.  We've recorded so many milestones since we received this.  It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.  I'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've been using the baby tracker since the day my daughter came home from the hospital.  We're on the third one now.  It's useful for when the doctor asks how often she's feeding and urinating, but even better for looking at and realizing, &#34;Oh, she hasn't slept in x number of hours.  She's probably crying because she's tired.&#34;  But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule.  I flipped through a couple weeks and looked at when she seemed to be sleeping during the day and looked for a pattern, then started putting her down for naps around those same times each day.  It helps a lot."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've been using this since the day my baby was born (1 month ago) and it is a life saver!  It is a great way to track when I breastfeed, what breast he ate from, how long, etc.  Plus when pee diapers are changed and poopy diapers.  Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day...so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all.  I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate, slept, or pottied.  I plan on ordering 3 more so I have enough to track this entire first year of his life!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have used this book since my son was born.  It's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper.  Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor.  This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I'm gone.  They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I'm at work.  Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age.  I'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "THis has been helpful in tracking the feedings, diaper changes, naps and other developmental things for our little one but I REALLY wish they had laid it out so that you could leave it open and have the left side be AM and the right PM.  The way the pages are set up you have to flip a page to see a full day (starts with PM on the left and A.M. on the right).  It's a nitpick but if they had just let the user fill in AM or PM then the pages would be identical and you could look at a full day at a glance (with your hands full, holding a baby).  Sort of a pain to have to lean forward to pick it up and flip a page over just to see what happend prior."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was a lifesaver especially during the first couple of months.  Being a new mom (and dad) we were exhausted and I can't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed, changed, etc. without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day.  It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need.  It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent (or whoever).  Once this ran out I bought another type of journal and am wishing I had just bought this one again."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Both of my boys (1 and 2.5) love stacking and building.  They also love cars.  So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them.  They both love these cars!  All of the cars have a little &quot;surprise&quot; (the ladder on the firetruck &quot;clicks&quot; as it raises up and down, the siren on the police car spins, etc.) &amp; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older.  They're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest, bigger, biggest."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab.  The bright colourful colours really held her attention.  When she was sitting we played the &quot;Mummy stack them, Baby knock them down&quot; game and &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; with the smaller colours under the bigger cars.  They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on (especially the small green one) when she was teething.  At 2, she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over.  She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game!  Great for learning big and small, colours and numbers.  Good value!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item."}

I couldn't believe the prices!  I found this and ordered it for my three kids (9 mos, 2 years, and 3 years), and they all love it.  It's pricey, but it's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others.  Great book, and I love that all the pieces are attached!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This book keeps my 2-year-old entertained for a decent amount of time, and I like that it's washable.  It has a good number/variety of activities in it, especially as compared to other similar types of books.There are some activities for babies, but I think toddlers/pre-schoolers will get the most use out of it.  My daughter has a hard time getting the snaps on/off (they require a little extra &#34;elbow grease&#34; and/or for you to hold down the fabric on the page).  There are also some &#34;older&#34; activities, like the clock, or tying a shoe.Overall, good purchase."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The teether just arrived for my ten month old who seems to be cutting his second tooth.He's already figured out how to activate the vibration.  It is soft, yet has some ridges and bumps that he is pulling with his teeth and gums.  I think baby gives it 5 stars!!!There were contradictory reviews on whether the batteries were replaceable or not- the packing says they are NOT.  So unless whoever said they were replaceable is just handier than the rest of us, they do not appear to be replaceable."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I like this product a lot, but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process... the product vibrates great, the colors are attractive to her, and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab. However, its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment. Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better. But overall I really like it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My son loves this.  He likes the &quot;kangaroo&quot; position best. He was actually crying the first time we put him in it this way, and stopped immediately.  DEFINITELY make sure the one you buy comes with the video, though.  At our Babies R Us many were just in plastic bags (returns?) without the book and video.  They are a must.  The usual type carriers which have baby putting all their weight on their pelvic bone aren't good for their developing bones.  Slings keep the baby in more natural positions."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this as a spare for my original Co-Sleeper. There really aren't a ton of places you can buy these, so I wasn't too concerned about the price. All told, Baby Bungalow did offer it for the best price, including shipping.While the sheet is a perfect fit, I was perplexed by the 'button' holes on the under side of each corner. Can't imagine what those are for. That or my Co-Sleeper is on the older side and there have been design changes since.Overall, quality product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags, we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail, and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.  Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.  Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell!  Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid, something I could have bought for cheaper."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It's very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It makes so much more sense to just use regular kitchen trash bags, more cost effective. It is easier to use. There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well \"hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers\". Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so \"diaper genieized\" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable. I highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I like the Diaper Champ.  My little boy's room doesn't stink from dirty diapers.  I empty it once a week, when it is time for trash pick-up.  I like the fact of using regular trash bags instead of having to buy special bags.  I do wipe it down a couple of times a month.  I have also put in a box of baking soda to help absorb the odors inside.  I highly recommend this product.  It is very easy to drop in your dirty diapers."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have no doubt that my wife and I will be happy with the Diaper Champ (our first baby is due in two weeks).  But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works.  The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a  piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down).  The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily.  It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn.  This is not one handed operation as the box states.  After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.  And you do not even need to ask.  Yes, it was made in China."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink. of course you have to clean the whole thing out from time to time (which should be expected considering the toxic waste it stores!), but i never had any issues with smell, unless it was so full it had to be emptied anyway. what sold me on this diaper pail vs. the others, is that this one takes ANY plastic bag you want to put in it, meaning grocery bags, trash bags... nothing fancy. as a new mom (or new parent) you have enough things to worry about and spend your money on; last thing you need is to head to the store for diaper pail bags. no complaints from me on this diaper pail."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "What I liked:  Contained the smell.  Ease of use.  Takes regular garbage bags (saves money!).  Great capacity (empty it out once in 7 days or so). Sturdy. Easy to clean - I wipe it down with Clorox wipes.What I didn't like: Not especially good-looking and at times the lid gets stuck in a certain position (could just be a problem with mine) hence the four stars.Would buy again though and do recommend it. (I have used the Diaper Genie at a friend's place - didn't like it)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this diaper pail after struggling for several months with the Diaper Genie.  The Diaper Champ was hands down the best diaper pail I used while my child was in diapers (I used three: Diaper Genie, Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and the Diaper Champ).  I didn't have to spend loads of money on the special Diaper Genie bags anymore, it had far superior odor control as compared to the Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and it's really easy to use - drop a diaper in, flip the handle over, done!  I actually developed pain in my elbow from all the twisting the Diaper Genie required as it wrapped each diaper into its little sausage-like casing.  I passed this diaper pail on to a friend once I was finished with it, and will happily purchase it for other friends in the future."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "After reading all the reviews on-line for this product I chose to register for it, now that I am using it I am disappointed.  I'm not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero's or my daughter has super smelly diapers.  Either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the \"Champ\" is in the back corner of the room.  I guess I'm just grateful that the whole house doesn't smell as bad as her room."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag. The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are. I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is another great baby purchase.  When I brought it home, my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a \"gadgety\" baby thing that we didn't need.  He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked!First, it really keeps the odor in.  I'm pretty sensitive to smells, but this one does a good job of containing odors.  Just to play it safe though, I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so (you could probaby go longer), and I spray it with Lysol as well.  Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.  Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain---I definitely recommend this product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "You can't put poopie diapers in this pail, it doesn't hold the smell back at all.  I use it for the wet diapers and it's fine.  I use the scented bags for the poopie diapers and throw them away in my regular garabage that gets taken out every day.  Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.  The big blue round part on the side broke off for some reason and it wouldn't go back on.  I ended up using masking tape to hold it on.  It serves it's purpose, but I'm not thrilled with it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills. Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of? I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula. I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, \"Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?\"The Champ works great. We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags. We've never experienced odor from the pail. It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion. I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...Highly recommended!!! Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Diaper Champ has been wonderful in our home!! It locks away the smell so wonderfully that we purchased a second one for downstairs. I originally chose this one, because it doesn't use costly refills. The lid is quite heavy, so you do have to be careful of your fingers when changing the bags, but that's the only concern I've had with it. When you do open it to change the bags, you may want to do so outside. You'll quickly see just how well it locks the odors in."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.  At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!  It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.  I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.  The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We just couldn't bring ourselves to buy a pail that required us to purchase extra refills.  This pail is great.  I do put really dirty diapers into a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail, to reduce the chance of nasty seepage and rub-off onto the chamber as the diaper is moved into the bottom.  It is not difficult to open, and the fact that it has a good clasp offers a sense of security for when our little girl starts pulling herself up on things, which will be soon (she's 8 months old).  We change the bag a couple of times a week, and the nursery smells fine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper.  (Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills. While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags, that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired. My son's room smelled very badly, even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience. Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine. Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED! You use any type of bag you want, and I love this idea. The refills for all the others are so spendy and they don't hold that many diapers. I'd rather buy cheap 13 gallon garbage bags from wal-mart or use one of the gazillion plastic grocery bags we already have in a cupboard at home. It also keeps the smell away perfectly fine-until you open it of course to take the bag out to the garbage can! It's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well. I think it's great and I highly recommend it to every family that loves to save money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Unlike the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers. We have two of them since we mostly use cloth, but occasionally need to use a disposable. It's great, and very easy to use, but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers. It's so easy to use, my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun. She's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this! I was hesitant to buy too since the \"sheet\" is expensive and hardly a \"sheet\" at all. But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof. If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet. You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats. We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it. This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this based on good reviews in the Baby Bargains book, so I had high expectations. It does make it somewhat easier to change sheets in the middle of the night, but you still have to unsnap it from about 10 places on the crib to do so; I've also found the snaps a little difficult to engage. If you're not using crib bumpers, the look of all the elastic pieces on the crib slats isn't too attractive. I'm glad to have one of these, but it isn't the miracle sheet I hoped for."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It's kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet (and never having to change the crib sheet), but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight.  Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this, it got a bit easier.  It's not super fast to unsnap and snap on, but better than replacing the crib sheet (esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out).I have 3 of these so I don't have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough.  Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric, unfortunately."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My mom said to get enough crib sheets because it was something you had to change constantly.... I now have a drawer full of crib sheets that have never been used!  This is the best thing ever!  we put one on, and have the other one for an emergency.  It is soft, the cotton is excellent quality and the work of crib changing at 3 in the morning it just went from 10 minutes to 1 minute! nothing can bit 9 minutes of extra sleep in the middle of the night"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "UPDATE: After washing them only a few times, the snaps have been falling off so this sheet is not very sturdy. I now call it a \"disposable sheet\" and would rate it only 3 stars if I was allowed to change the rating.My previous review:This sheet is a fantastic idea. Imagine waking up to feed your baby only to have them spit up and/or poop/pee on the bed sheet. Instead of taken apart the bumper to remove the mattress to change the sheet, all that is required is to unsnap the corners that secure sheet in place. Then you put another one on...the whole process will take you less than 5 minutes. I have three, one for the hamper, one on the crib, and one waiting to be used in case of a bed wetting!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib. I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress, and I've never taken it off. I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets. I have three; I would recommend that number. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets...this is just SO EASY snap, snap, snap and you're done!I never dry mine in the dryer. I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours. I want mine to last, and using the dryer tends to wear them out. I've never not had one on hand, with 3 total."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The first time I went to change the crib sheet on my baby's crib I understood the importance of the Ultimate Crib Sheet!  It was given as a gift & I put one more on my registry after realizing I had to take the whole crib ensemble apart to change the sheet!  Now I change the sheet only occasionally & it is more for asthetics.  The Ultimate Cribe sheet snaps off & I put a clean one on - so easy & practical!  Save money on sheets & just get one or two decorative sheets & get at least 2 of these!!!Update at 7 mos (July04): I have survived VERY WELL with 2 of the Ultimate Crib Sheets - and boy when they start slithering around the crib & wetting through diapers & spitting up solids - you will be SO thankful to have this little dandy item!  Don't go without!!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I absolutely love the idea of this crib sheet. After receiving one as a gift I immediately tried putting it in the crib. To my disappointment, the elastics at the corners will not fit around the wide posts of my crib. For those of you that have Italian made cribs (I have a Baby Italia), this sheet may not work for you either. This should come as no suprise since it is also harder to find crib bumpers that fit correctly too. Needless to say, if you have an Italian made crib, keep the packaging and the receipt. You may find that you'll have to try another brand."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Reality is...you don't have to have this, but it really helps simplify your life if you do.  You don't have to take off the crib bumper and lift the mattress to take off this crib sheet.  Instead, you just unsnap and place a clean one on top of the mattress.  I have a regular crib sheet under the Ultimate Crib Sheet for decorative purposes and in case he needs to be placed on it if my spare is dirty.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's annoying to have to snap all of the straps prior to washing it and also because there is some shrinking that occurs after it's washed (Make sure you put it on the low setting in your dryer).  Also, they are expensive.  I have two of them and it's worked out just fine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great product!  Buy two and put them both in the crib.  When your little one leaks in the night, just unsnap and toss the dirty one aside, and you'll have a clean one underneath.  As far as the snaps falling off, my son had pyloric stenosis (severe vomiting requiring surgery) and I washed these 3 or 4 times a day for weeks.  Never once did I have any of the permanent snaps fall (there are two completely detachable snaps on the ends that I don't even use).  I even washed and dried on the normal cycle (not gentle) in warm water (not cold, as is recommended)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this, put it on the crib, took one look at it, took it off, and returned it.  I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it--it bunched and wouldn't lay flat.  Also the snaps didn't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure.  This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment.  My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I don't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have never changed the sheet on my daughter's crib.  Instead, I have 2 ultimate crib sheets that I alternate between.  I can't tell you how awesome it's been.  In general, they're easier to change than regular crib sheets.  In a pinch (ie, diaper explosion or sick baby in the middle of the night), they make life SO much easier.  Just fold the sheet up to contain the mess, take it to the laundry room, snap the new one on, and you're good to go.I've read reviews that said they didn't like this sheet, but I love it.  You don't need any other mattress pad with it, either."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet is a very useful product.  It protects the sheet, eliminating the need to change the crib sheet if there is diaper leakage or spitting up.  It goes on and off in seconds - so helpful to a Mom, especially in the middle of the night. It is large enough to cover the whole crib surface.  It seems to be waterproof and yet doesn't make the baby sweaty.My only concern would be that since it attaches to the crib rails, there is an outside chance a baby could loosen/undo a strap.I think it would be handy to have two of these to rotate them out.  I like it and would recommend it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Lifesaver for this middle of the might diaper leaks! It's always a pain to change a crib sheet in the middle of the night, but this makes it so much easier. I just put it on top of his regular sheet (which is over a waterproof mattress pad). He occasionally has a diaper leak. When he does, I simply unsnap the ultimate crib sheet (there are roughly 10 snaps to keep it in place) and let him sleep the rest of the night on his regular sheet. The snaps can be a little tricky to remove with one hand (say when you're holding a baby), but I generally start unsnapping while he is still in the crib."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When my newborn was in her Co-Sleeper, changing wet bedding every morning was no big deal -- but a move to the crib meant a HUGE daily struggle to disassemble the bumper, manhandle the mattress and strip the sheet and mattress pad, then reverse the whole process after washing and drying. The Ultimate Crib Sheet is truly that: just undo a few snaps and toss it in the wash. It's soft and durable, and your expensive bedding and mattress pad stay fresh and dry. In hindsight, wish I'd had several of these on my registry."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer.  We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner.  The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners.  No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side.  So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn't appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue.  If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn't seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions.  We'll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The method that I used for potty training had me completely throw away the diapers and didn't allow for pull ups.  (It worked well!)  About a month after we started my daughter had a string of accidents at night out of the blue.  I was constantly changing sheets and was tired of it, that is when I found this.  Turns out my daughter was sick at the time, but once I got two of these it was so easy to just move her and take this pad off to wash it instead of stripping and remaking the bed.  I wish I had known about this when I first started potty training (for nap time and bedtime).  It is also relatively small to pack if you are traveling somewhere and you are afraid of your child wetting the bed this is great for that too.  I now have this off of her bed again, but I can't say enough good stuff about this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this because it used regular trash bags and you don't have to worry about a huge long twisted snaky thing unraveling when you take it to the trash.  I've been using it almost a year.  I do use those cheap Bowl Fresh toilet deodorizers instead of ordering the disks.  I clip the hanger off and break it in half (while it's still in the plastic) and add half or both, just depends.  The deodorizers last about 1-2 months and it's cheap! I empty it about every 3 days and spray it down w/ Lysol before adding another bag.  Not had any stinky problems and this is in my hallway right by the familyroom. I do take it outside every month and give it a good cleaning w/ bleach and a garden hose."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags. That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail. The springs have been popping off since about the first month. My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke, which completely gets rid of the supposed &quot;odor-free&quot; feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either).  Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Yes, my spring broke as well... but looking on the brighter side: when my son is old enough to walk he won't be able to accidently press the spring button to release the pail cover... it's kind of an unexpected safety feature! And yes, you can still open it with one hand... your fingers are not glued to one another. Really, diapers will stink no matter what pail you use.... The covered pail is cheap and doesn't require buying refill bags (especially since we use cloth diapers)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Initially my husband and I decided not to purchase a diaper pail because we wondered what was the point, diapers stink and no matter how much money one spends on a diaper pail it's going to emit odors and smell bad. Then, when we were changing diapers ten times a day we decided it would probably be easier to have one, especially for the middle of the night diaper changes. Several of my friends disapproved of the Diaper Genie and recommended we purchase an inexpensive diaper pail that uses regular garbage bags. We took that advice and selected the Safety 1st diaper pail and we are pleased with the product. Odor-Less - No. We empty it as needed, usually once a week, and realize it's a diaper pail - just as our garbage pail in the Kitchen needs to be emptied daily someday so will the diaper pail. I place an aroma jell in the little basket which helps with the odor."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really like this diaper pail.  It helps with odor control, but is certainly not odorless.  As if anything can disguise the odor of a poopy diaper.  I think that a diaper pail is a must in the nursery.  There are just too many diapers to not have one and an open garbage can or even a regular one is just too stinky.  This one has a lid that closes nicely to shut out odors.  It has a nice little compartment for odor disks to help manage odor.  It can be a bit of a hassle to empty and reload, but it only needs changing about every two days and since it fits regular kitchen bags, it is worth the money.  It isn't very expensive to begin with."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My little guy is very active and loves to get into trouble. We only have a couple items plugged into an outlet that isn't covered by furniture so I purchased these to make sure he couldn't pull the plug out of the wall and get shocked. They are wonderful and I feel much safer letting my little guy explore the house. Even though I am never too far away our let him out of sight he still manages to get into things. He is so fast and just a little distraction could be fatal. But I don't have to worry about the plugs anymore! One less worry and just the little bit of stress relief that makes this purchase very easy for me to recommend it to all parents."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover.#1: The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover. They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me, I need to go purchase a handful of screws.#2: Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic, small, two-prong plugs. So what won't fit? Our laptops, our phone charger (Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall), iPod chargers, computer charger, power strip plug, light dimming plug attached to lamp, DSLR charger, baby sound machine, Verizon Fios plugs. Well crap... what appliance plugs DID fit, you ask? A lamp. Just one lamp. Oh, and the electric toothbrushes.Useless, sending them back. The Safety 1st units are square (not pyramid shaped) and hold various plugs."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I tried to use this power strip cover for about 2 months when our twin daughters were 8-10 months old. It was frustrating for my husband & I -- hard to get the power strip inside, hard to keep things plugged in, and too big to hide out of the babies view (not to mention that it's bulky and a bit ugly). For the babies, it became yet another interesting thing around the house that we had to wrestle from their hands. They were able to unplug the cords easily and were starting to reach their fingers into the top hole when I finally gave up on using it. Yes, the cover did keep the babies from actually touching the outlets in the power strip, but I could have accomplished the same thing with a couple of normal outlet covers.In the end, I rearranged our cords making the power strip & this cover unnecessary. It was just too annoying to keep using the cover."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this some time ago. I finally started using it last week. It was very difficult to figure out how to use. But, once I ready the instructions a few times I got it.  My 8 month old loves all electric cords. I needed something to protect her. For the past week this has been working.Only one side of it can I get a big 3 prong plug into it. I only need 2 openings to get in and out of so it hasn't presented itself as a major problem yet. I would purchase another one of these."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Really? How could this possibly be useful? I saw somebody else post that the baby's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating. Really, I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier. The baby's whole hand fits through the giant gap. Plus the thing is huge. Like almost as big as a shoe box. And really ugly. I don't know what we'll replace it with since the others don't sound better, but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show. There's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room, so I might as well just leave the cords as is."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have two very busy almost two year old twins who were fascinated with the power strip in their playroom. This cover isn't the most attractive thing, but works. They cannot reach into it or access anything, (not sure what hole people are talking about), and have left it alone.  It's about the size of a one liter soda bottle, and slides together/apart to extend the length. It is tall enough, but not quite long enough to secure together firmly on our extra long power strip. It still works however, and is the best solution I've found. Would recommend."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This works pretty well to keep little hands from grabbing power strips. It also has the option of hanging it on the wall which I really like. The things I was not happy about was the quality of the plastic seems flimsy and also if you have to hook it on the last hole due to the size of your power strip it barely stays together. For our longest strip we had to duct tape around the entire device to make sure it stays together. Other than that it's a decent little contraption that does its job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have busy almost-two year old twins who are fascinated with the many window blinds in our house. I didn't want to spend a fortune, but needed a quick fix. These did the trick, easy to install, and keep the cords just out of their reach. They do pop off from time to time, but are easily replaced. I've purchased several different brands, and they are all about the same. I wouldn't spend extra money on ones that claim to do better than this type."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These locks just cannot be beat.  They were featured on HGTV to baby-proof your house which is how I found out about them in the first place.  They cannot be opened at ALL by the child, unlike many of the other items out there.  You have to not only have the key to open the door, you have to know how to manipulate it to open.  If you have chemicals that you have store within a child's reach, there is no other better way than this lock to make SURE that child is safe.  I feel very blessed that I found out these locks exist because my little one is extremely curious and figures out EVERYTHING! Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  Regarding the installation, my husband is not a handyman - he's a musician and if he can figure it out, so can just about anyone else.  Buy them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is simply a great product.  It is installed inside the cabinet so there is nothing to see from the front.  The newer models work even easier than the original ones we purchased years ago.  They open easily when the magnet is put near (don't even need to touch the cabinet door).  We use these in several places over the house and love the convenience, but piece of mind it gives.  They are also pretty strong - our 3 1/2 year old pulls and tries to open sometimes and has not broken or pulled open any drawer.NOTE - The old version needed a drill to make a small hole on the lock which sits inside the door, but the newer ones like this no longer require that hole to be made. These work better and are easier to install - just need a screwdriver and a few minutes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was a product that I used when I worked in child care and I always liked the fact that it is &#34;invisible&#34; and is not an obvious eye-sore on your cabinets. But when I tried to install on my sink cabinet, one side worked like a charm and the other side just won't work. I can find no discernible reason for this and it is very frustrating. The two parts line up fine, but they won't latch. And the two cabinet sides were installed what seems like identically to me, but apparently not. In my opinion, it shouldn't be this difficult to make accurate measurements to ensure that the product will work. It might just be my cabinets, but they are not anything crazy or out of the ordinary. I am frustrated that I will have to drill more holes into my cabinet and there is no guarantee that it will work!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am opening a home daycare and these are some of the only locks that are approved by the state of Washington. I really like the fact that they can be unlocked for long periods of time, so when I am working in the kitchen I can leave them unlocked and then quickly lock them again. They are really not hard to install, I watched a video on You Tube that showed how to install them and then went and did it.I am going to recommend these to people I know. I really think they would be great for grandparents or anyone who has young kids visiting often because you can turn them off when the kids are not there, most other child locks do not have that feature."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I really love this set of clippers. After trying many different brands and styles - this is the one that we love. The blades are dull enough that they do not clip skin but sharp enough to cut sharp little nails. My baby's grow quickly so these clippers are used often. I like that the grip it small enough to fit in my hand easily but not too big to make me clumsy.I love the grip, that it moves with me and keeps me stable so that I only clip nails. It will not work for big people nails, which is nice - it means I can always find it when I need!I highly recommend these clippers to caregivers of infants and toddlers. Hands down my favorite clippers - perfect on the pocketbook too!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago.  I tried to trim my 3 month old son's nails, granted he is the fidgeting type.  Just as I was about to clip one of his nails, he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger.  His finger bled, my son cried and I panicked.  Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage.  But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company.  They are VERY safe.  I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents.  I shudder to think of using nail clippers again, especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When I bought this item, I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby's temperature.  I use this thermometer only on occasion.  It's convenient, but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached.  It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long.  It's getting harder for my baby to accept this \"pacifier\", now that she is on the larger, 6-month-plus sized pacifiers.  Also, check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings: our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am sorry I bought this tub.  It is very uncomfortable for my daughter.  Used it since she was about 3 weeks old.  I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it's uncomfortable.  Also, there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain!  It's way too small.  She's now 4.5 mos and I'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it.  And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug -  it's an enormous effort to plug it each time.I've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger, nicer, more comfortable, and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this tub before my son was born, thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink.  I do like that I can use it in the sink, but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds!  It doesn't hold much water, either.  I wish I had read reviews before I bought it, because now, after only 2 months, I'm just going to replace it and throw it away.  What a waste!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you... except that you'll only use it for 3 months  because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space.  As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that.  And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at.  Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this as a shower gift. The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub. She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again. I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption. I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here. I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone. Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year....."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year.  Living in an apartment, this tub is great for small spaces.  I use it in the big tub and when I am done, I just rinse it and leave it to dry.  When dried, I fold it and put it in the cabinet.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping.  But considering it folds for storage, that was not a big issue.  It's a great tub otherwise."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had ordered a different tub for my shower but never received it.  I had my baby so I picked up this tub last week.  However I could not figure out how to use the sling alone for my 1 week old infant.  It appears that you have to hold her head up while in the sling which leaves you with only 1 hand to bathe her with.  But anyone with an infant knows that they kick and squirm and I found it very hard to use.  I tried to snap it into the tub for the 2nd stage (thinking better support) and I could not get it to fit!Much easier to sponge bathe a new baby on a contoured changing pad.  I'm thinking of returning and going for the EuroTub."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet. Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby. Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old. I have not had any problems with the tub leaking. But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times. I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies. The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body. It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help. It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub. I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We love this tub.  We have been using it since our daughter's first bath.  It was tough to pop the tub into the expanded version, but that tight fit means it won't leak.  If you don't pop it together right it will leak.  We leave it set up in the tub when not in use so it's not really taking up any vital space.  Our daughter seems to like the sling.  She's four months old now and didn't cry even during her first bath.3/06 - We're now using this tub on child #2.  Still no problems.  This child likes it too.  Between the two girls we've been using this tub for 22 mo.  It has never leaked, not once."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it. I followed all the directions, I was very careful and patient with this tub, I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom. The design idea was good but it just isn't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly. The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring isn't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub. No matter how hard I work it's impossible to keep this tub clean."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use.  My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue.  It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good, either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it.  I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead.  I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born.  It is very easy to put over my sink.  The green net comes with the tub is easy to use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Unfortunately, I am not able to find this bathtub anywhere (( My son used to have it 6-7 years ago). It is great! It is the only one bathtub where a baby does not slip forward and doesn't go under water. This blue gear is awesome. I do not understand why it is discontinued. I do not care if it is leaking. I did not notice that because it was used in adult bathtub. IF SOMEBODY HAS IT, PLEASE, I WILL BUY FROM YOU."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks. This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week. I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water. So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks. Really, who wants a tub that leaks???? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub....so we are in an awkward transition phase. a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with. I wouldn't buy this tub."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It leaks every time I use it. It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.  I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.  I love the sling, but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.  If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside, it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.  I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using, I should have.  I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.  Buy at your own risk."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My mom bought this for us after she decided that the bath chair we already owned was not good enough.  This has been the best bathtub we could have ever wanted!  The newborn sling is nice, and lets baby have contact with the water without feeling overwhelmed.  Our baby didn't really like bath time until he could sit up by himself, and at that point this bath tub became a necessity.  Baby loves to explore the tub, and the secure bath ring helps keep him safely and securely in one place.  He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way, too!  I especially like it because I don't have to worry about him slipping under the water accidentally if I look away for a second to get his towel ready or something.  We had a problem with leaking at first, too, but once we read the instructions and pushed the bottom down securely, we haven't had a problem since."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Not sure why this got bad reviews.  There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position, if you don't snap it in right, it will leak.  But once we figured that out we had no problems.  We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem.  Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe.  Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub, great value!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower.  I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub.  Wrong!!  First of all, the tub leaks.  You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide.  My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy.  The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i was surprised to read all those negative reviews regarding this tub.  i had two different tubs before, and i got this one when my daughter was 5 months old, she's now one year old and still uses it.  granted, i never tried to fold it since those few inches don't seem to make much of a difference storagewise, so i don't know if its difficult to do.  i've had absolutetly no leaks with this tub, and the suction cups still work great.  the bathring works great, and can be moved out of the way when baby is old enough to sit alone.  although i still use the bathring so my daughter cant stand up all the time.  it's been 7  months with this tub, and nothing ever broke, or got worn.  i think this tub is great!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "this is the worst bath tub i've bought. i returned this item right away. it leaks. once i pulled it out to be longer but, no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together, it just wouldn't click. when i pressed it to lock the extension, i couldn't tell whether it locked or not, so then i put water to test the lock system. the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.now, i bought the Euro bath. it does a good job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When our son started rolling into chairs, we knew we needed something to keep him safe.  This play yard fits great in our living room, yet there's plenty of room for him to roll around in all directions.  Also, I like that it's see-thru.  You can see  your baby (and he can see you) from across the room.  I don't care that it's not the most attractive thing.  It was affordable and it does the job.  And when our son starts crawling, we can completely close it and know that he won't be able to sneak off.  One suggestion I would make to the manufacturer though would be to pad or provide padding around the bottom, about six inches high.  My son falls asleep with his head on the edge all the time (NOT very comfortable), and when I move him away from it, he wakes up.  It'd be nice to not have to move him."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is one of only a few products my husband and I would buy again with no hesitation.  We bought it over a year ago (with the extension) and have used it every day since.  When my daughter outgrew the octoganal arrangement, we just opened it up and have used it to block her from the kitchen and other dangerous areas.  She is not a climber yet, so I do NOT recommend using it in this fashion if your child is.  It will tip over, the circular formation is the sturdiest.  We haven't had any problems with pieces breaking off or the plastic being brittle and we adjust it almost daily.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. This is our experience. Your mileage may vary.Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! (&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. So far it's not too much of a problem. The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. The major downside is the price. Ack."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I recieved this as a shower gift and began using it when my daughter began to crawl.  It was better than any play yard because there is much more room for toys and for baby.  As she grew (and the number of toys as well), I purchased an extension to make the area bigger.  It was great for both indoor and outdoor use.  We also used it to block the large open area between our kitchen and family room that no other gate would be large enough to cover.  Now that winter is here and she is running about, we are using it to block our wood(pellet) stove to prevent any accidents.  We also plan on using it around our Christmas tree again this year. Other reviews have complained that it is not sturdy or difficult to set up.  I have never had a problem and it folds up and stores easily.  Well worth it for it's versatility."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got our twin boys this Mozart Magic Cube for Christmas, when they were 6 months old.  We liked everything about it...except that it was TOO LOUD!  I've actually been amazed at the number of baby toys that are annoyingly loud.  Some to the point that they made our babies cry (like this one).  I've actually had to place duct tape over speaker holes on numerous things such as mobiles, play gyms, and an activity table because otherwise those products are great, just loud.  But therein lies the problem with this toy - there is no obvious speaker hole on it.  It's as if the annoyingly loud music emanates from every crevice.  Which is why it has been put away since Christmas.  Now that the boys are 9.5 months I may try to bring it out again and see if they will tolerate it.  If not I'll just sell this overpriced piece of plastic at my MOMs Resale next month."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn't seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new \"upgraded\" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The \"music\" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I know it says that this is for older babies but my daughter loves looking at the blinking lights and listening to the music. A piece of advice: it took me a little while to figure out that you had to press the orchestra button a few times to change the song. Before I figured this out, the same song was driving me crazy! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have a volume control button. It is quite loud and I sometimes wish I can make it lower."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My 4-5 month old baby loves this toy.  It is very easy to press the buttons and activate the sounds, so even very young, uncoordinated babies can get this toy to make noise.  As she gets older, she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors.  For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.  Eventually, we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy, where they still are (and we hope they stay there).  There seems to be no way to remove them entirely."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This toy inspires me. I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound. Now he gets the full functionality of the toy. It lasts for years, offering various entertainments to various ages of kids. Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones, so we love this. Warning, it's very heavy. Don't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma's (we learned this lesson). The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety. We're never giving away this adorable musical toy."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This item has been a life saver for me!  Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great toy.  My 7 month old daughter loves it and so do many of my musician friends.  There is one significant flaw in its design; this is that the volume is not adjustable and it is too loud.  If it were 1/2 this loud, I'd let me daughter play with it all the time.  As it is, I usually limit her to playing with it with me, so I can hold it away from her head/ears.Due to the too loud volume, I'm giving it a 4 star review, instead of 5.  Otherwise, it is a great, great product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "After looking for a musical toy that was not annoying, off-key or obnoxious, we discovered this.  Plays several songs by Mozart; baby can play a song with all instruments at once by pressing \"orchestra\" or one at a time.  Baby can also turn off instruments one at a time. The instruments are clearly synthesized, but still, the quality is not bad and I could listen to it for long periods of time.  I have yet to be annoyed by this toy.  In fact, I may have to buy two - my twins fight over it constantly!  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a little bit loud.  I wish there was a volume control."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.  I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This toy keeps my 4-month old's attention for a while - she really seems to like the flashing lights as the music plays.I only wish there was a volume button on it - it seems a bit loud to me (and if it seems loud to me wouldn't it seem loud to the baby as well?), and I wish it weren't quite so heavy.  It will be a long time before my baby will be able to turn the cube or pick it up, for now it just sits on the floor between her legs and she's able to hit the buttons that are facing up/out."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think a lot of kids these days have this toy. It's quite popular. All my friends with babies have it.It's a toy providing light entertainment.I'm a trained musician and I disagree with some reviews saying that the quality of the sound is poor. Trust me, for a toy it's totally fine. You can still tell the instruments apart. You can't expect your baby to become a little Mozart just by listening to this cube 5 minutes a day anyway.Everything seems to function well. It's safe. I'm not scared to turn away for 30 seconds. I know that there are no sharp edges and my baby won't hurt herself.I'm not sure this toy carries a lot of educational / developmental value but it's nice."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months. He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him. He now plays it himself (13 months). I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery. It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Based on the myriad of reviews here, I purchased this toy when my triplets were several months old.  To be honest, they did not care for or notice it until they were closer to 8 or 9 months.  At that point, they realized they could start and stop the music by hitting at it.  All of a sudden, they took great interest in it.  It was also excellent when they were just learning to sit unassisted.  They could lean forward and balance on the cube while playing at the same time.Now that they have \"figured\" it out, the toy is a little less appealing.  I am waiting for the next enjoyment phase to kick in when they start noticing and playing with the different instruments.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that battery life is shorter than I would have expected.  While not bad, it seems to slow down more quickly than our other battery operated toys."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones!  If your kid is like mine, however, and likes to sit on the potty \"unproductively\" you might want to consider something a little more comfortable.  The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside.  While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic.  Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting.  Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around.  I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it wouldn't fall into the toilet with a toddler's wiggling around.  You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This does fit on an elongated toilet seat, but it slides around. It wouldn't dump my kid in or anything, but the slipping might startle a child. I may see if I can find some sort of anti-slip stickers. I did not bother with the splash guard, I just threw it out. It looked flimsy and unnecessary. My daughter loves the SpongeBob theme. I'm not so fond of the vinyl seat, as my daughter's hiney sticks to it and is a little uncomfortable when she gets up. But, it's cheap enough and serves its purpose - allowing my daughter to sit on the big potty without falling in."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "this is a good toilet ring, but ONLY if you have the smallest, round toilet seats.  the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit, but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps.  my home has a mix of elongated/round seats, and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls.  we use that for our elongated seats, and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway.  otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The toilet set is nice.  Other reviewers had complained that it did not fit on their toilet seats but I have three different toilets and it works on all three.  It is a nice design and my son love that Thomas, Percy, & James are all on his potty seat.  The one problem is that it does not have a splash guard.  The packaging says it was supposed to have a splash guard and handle to hang on the toilet handle.  It did not come with either of these and when I contacted the seller she claimed they were not supposed to come with the seat.  According to the packaging and description they were!  My son was attached as soon as it saw it so I couldn't return it.  Check when you buy one of these.  If you have a boy you may not want to buy this unless it has the splash guard."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got two of these for relatively cheap. In concept, it's great. We have one at our house and it fits all of the toilets (we have 2 toto toilets, one Kohler and one other brand (not sure which) and it fits fine). My in laws have one at their house that we leave there and their toilets are round seats (Kohler and American Standard). We've never had any fit problems.The problem is the design. Pee trickles between the plastic and the cushion and pools there. Even if you clean it regularly, it smells NASTY. If you forget to clean it, next time you pick it up, the nasty pee drips everywhere.I am in the process of ordering a different one so that I can get rid of this one. Gross."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think there was so much written about this that my head probably over rated it and now I'm discontent. My kids doesn't even look at it unless I'm on all fours like a dog and carrying it in my mouth. But, really, I don't think he's looking at the worm at all but thinking, &#34;Mommy has gone bow wow wow crazy.&#34; It's soft and not even cute. Just, it is. That's it. No magic, just what you see people. If what you see on the screen isn't making you scream and yell, it'll probably get the same reaction. You want more, prepare to crawl and bark."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have two of these gates and we couldn't be more pleased with them.  They took a little time to install (it was a snap the second time around), and they are as sturdy and secure as you can get.  We don't feel the slightest twinge of concern when our 1 year old leans against this gate at the top of the steps.  We know it's not going anywhere.  The gate is so simple to open and close.  A small child would not be able to do it on his or her own though.  The gate's design ensures that little climbers will not be able to get a lift.  We've tried lots of gates and this one is our favorite."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this set for my 4 year old and he loves it. The dinosaurs are colorful and there are a lot of them to arrange on the little background. I am happy with the number and look of the dionos, trees and volcanoes. However I give it only 3 stars because the background is small and very flimsy, and the set really smells bad. Every time we open the box there is a very strong unpleasant plastic smell coming from inside the box. Not sure if it's the box it's-self or the contents.  I thought I would air it out a bit so I left the lid off over night, but when I entered the room in the morning the whole room smelled terrible from it. I really don't like the idea of my kid inhaling the fumes of some unknown plastic chemicals each time he opens the set so it now stays open and stored in the garage.  We play with them outside and they work fine for that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My son loves to play \"dino world\" just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Comes with 20 dinosaurs, 12 small rocks, a large volcano, a medium sized volcano, 6 trees, and a play mat. This set is great. I would prefer more dinosaurs and less rocks, but oh well. It is still great. My three and a half year old loves playing with this set. The play mat is actually pretty cheap, but my son doesn't seem to care. It is made of really thin plastic and doesn't stay open all the way since it has been folded. Once you put all the dinosaurs on it, though, it stays down just fine. All the rest of the stuff is high quality and the tub is great for keeping everything together. Just for size reference, the brachiosaurus is 6 1/2 inches tall, and this is the biggest dinosaur in the set. I'm really happy with the size of all the dinosaurs. I was worried that they were going to be kind of small, but they are a perfect size."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "How FUN and AWESOME!!! Got this for my grandson and still can't get over how bright and playful this is. Even I want to get in it and play! The built in activities on the side are the best. The squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby...but the other toys are super! It was so so so simple to put up!!! Love the bigger size, while not being overwhelming...those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most..."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am so happy with this play yard.  When  I put my four month old down inside it he looked around then looked up at me and smiled, I kid you not.  The only complaint I have is that the description here on Amazon says that the play yard is 38x38.  However when the box arrived it indicated that it is only 36X36, still plenty of space though.  I only paid $49.00 because I have the Amazon credit card and get reward certificates to use towards products, so between that and the free shipping I got a GREAT BUY for a GREAT PRODUCT.  Thank you Amazon and Graco!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I give this a 5 start plus.My 6 month old Grandbaby  was put in this playpen yesterday for his first time.  It was obvious he really liked it by the big smiles and how his mind was preoccupied with the play items on the sides and bottom. It was a difficult first baby shots day and he was hurting on both legs. The graphics and sides toys kept him more focused on fun & he was able to get some temporary relief.  I know as he feels better he is going to enjoy his new & safe play space even more.Thank you Amazon for this colorful playpen choice at the lowest price and your excellent service. I'll positively be back."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Just got this playpen a few days ago. It is awesome! Set it up without instructions in under 2 minutes, and I'm 6 months pregnant which makes some things a challenge. It's a very nice size and fits a good deal of toys, though if the room is small it does take up a lot of space. Baby loves the bug toys on the sides. She's just learning to sit on her own and I was very pleased to see when she fell back she did not cry - the floor pad is thick and soft so it cushioned her head. I like that because she did fall backwards once in her gym (placed on the carpet) and was very upset. With this I know if she falls back she won't get hurt. It's very colorful and she really seems to enjoy her time in it. Great purchase!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Still using this... its big and he doesn't mind going in it for me to shower. We also have used it to help him calm down, if he throws a fit we just sit him in with a toy and tell him when he is ready we will get out. Works well, just walk away and he calms down without an audience. Then we get back out, also when I tell him I want him to go in so I can take a shower he goes to it and waits to be put in. So he definately doesn't mind. He likes the toys in it too, wheres the baby (the mirror) was a favorite."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think this playpen is great; it's spacious, sturdy, and colorful. My 10 month old thinks it's a prison. She will tolerate it for about 10-15 minutes at a time, which is fine because it buys me some time where I don't have to worry about her safety. I first introduced her to the playpen when she was about 7 months old. I think she found all of the characters at the bottom to be frightening, but she was fine after I put the sheet on. I'd hoped she'd grow to spend more time in the playpen, but tolerates it less and less as she becomes more mobile."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great for play.  I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However, I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep.  Unfortunately, the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets (must be purchased from company other than Graco) cause the pad to be a little lumpy.  My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it, it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do.  I am happy with it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been looking for the play yard that I had for my children. The other pack and plays are too small. I don't understand why they don't sell these in stores all the time. I live in Hawaii and have been trying to buy one of these for three years. No one would ship to Hawaii. When, I saw it on Amazon. I was amazed and decided to try to order it. I was really shocked as I was going through checkout. And, amazingly they were letting me order it. The shipping was really cheap. And, I ordered it on Sunday and received it on Wednesday. How, wonderful. My grandson was put in there immediately to see his reaction. He is only 6 months old and loved it. Thank You Amazon for having this wonderful product. And, of course shipping it to me. I am going to order one more. Just totally LOVE it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I like this pack n play. The only problem I have is that the middle kind of sinks in so unless your baby is a highly experienced sitter, it is tough for them to balance b/c it's slanted in towards the center. But the colors are pleasing and I didn't know this but the animals/sun embroidered on all 4 sides have little attachements that the baby can play with when their in the pack n play. That was a nice little surprise. My daugter loves the little wings on the bee b/c they have little rattles in them and they make noise when she hits them."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "why do I love this play pan?  Very simple:1. Great quality material; sturdy and safe2. Large with lots of space (my grandson crawls around).  Can fit two kids!3. Very easy to assemble!3. Very colorful!  Bright beautiful colors.  My grandson looks at it and want to jump from my arms inside of the pan.4. The colorful patches around it are toys!The toys are:a) A beautiful butterfly with wings that when squeezed it make a dried plastic sound (he loves it)b) A lady bug that makes sounds alsoc) A sun with a mirror (safe for babies)d) A bee with playful wings, which also makes soundsI strongly recommend this play pan!  My daughter has another one, not Graco, that is half of the size.  It is nice but not eye catching like this one.It is worth every single penny!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Buy this Pack N Play!!  All pros and no cons on this.  It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags. Only three parts, just the frame, the folding padded floor, and the carrying bag.  It is roomy, has plenty of padding, and has 9 legs for a strong and even base.  It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can't express how much I love this play yard. My son has been using and playing in this since he was 5 months old and he is 15 months old now. The bright colors, designs, and toys caught his attention right away. When I put him in other play yards we have, he won't stay in it long and wants to come out right away, but when we put him in this play yard he is completely distracted and has fun playing in it with his other toys. There is a lot of space for him to move around and it is very sturdy. I also love how easy it is to set up and take down plus the carry bag makes it easier to bring when traveling back and forth to his grandma's house. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this product in all respects, except for the four paneled padded flooring.The design of it tends to not lay flat, once you put a sheet or a cover on it.This is a real flaw in the design.  AND, it is super important that you follow thedirections for putting this up, and be sure to use the velcro straps to securethe flooring pad in place.  Just get the help of another person to secure thevelcro straps, and you will be all set.  Otherwise, I do like the sturdiness of theside rails, and the bright primary colors.  Not the best for napping, as thebaby will continuously play with the built in side toys.  Some of the toysrattle and crinkle, and once baby finds the party, they will not want to laydown to nap.  But I still love this playyard so much, I bought two of them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Highly recommend this to all parents with Infant and Toddlers. This is such a great playpen to have in your home as an alternative to the crib. My son loves to play in it and also sleep in his playpen which we put in the living room. We bought this together with some fitted pack n play (Graco Square Play Yard) from SheetWorld on Amazon (if anyone is interested) and the sheets totally fit the square pad that comes with the playpen. We also made an extra padding cushion so it would be comfortable for our son to sleep in. You can also fold this up nicely and make it compacted for traveling if need to. This is a great purchase! :) You will not dissapoint."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I LOVE these because they are really convenient and easy to use. We have it by our pool (baby gated) under the overhang so we can enjoy the pool and sun and yet have LO out there playing or asleep at the same time. It is very convenient. I do not like the cleaning issues. It is hard to clean and though it is billed &#34;PACK N PLAY&#34; like it is the &#34;umbrella stroller&#34; of play yards, it is hardly that easy to just fold and run."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for this pack n play solely on the wonderful amazon reviews that I read. I wanted something larger for my baby to play in, and the Graco TotBloc definitely delivers.  That being said, this pack n play stinks as a napping or travel crib.  It's large, bulky, the foam bottom is thin and not very comfy for baby to sleep on, and there is no mattress option for a pack n play this size!  I took this on a trip last weekend and put the baby in there with a blanket on the bottom so she wasn't uncomfortable. Every time she rolled around, it would make the rattle toy attached to the walls of the pack n play move. It actually woke her up, and it was a long night. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone wanting this to double as a napping crib.If I had to do it all over again, I would have gone with the Joovy like I originally planned."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm an older mom (40+) who did a lot of babysitting as a teen and remembers what big, square playpens used to be like...not the cramped, rectangular things everyone has now. This spacious pack and play is wonderful! Our 10-month-old daughter loves it - we have it in our kitchen so we can set her in it for a few minutes while we use the stove or chop up food (cases where, for obvious reasons, we wouldn't want her underfoot). She can see us, we can talk with her, and she has plenty of room to practice pulling herself up and walking along the edges (and falling on her bum on the padded floor). When she was younger, she loved playing with the attached toys (especially the butterfly with the crinkly wings).It's sturdy, easy to set up and take down, and packs away neatly into its carrying case. An all-around great product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this play yard to put my 8 month old in when I need to keep her contained and safe while I am cooking. It is perfect. The size is ideal as she is able to roll and move around it and play with her toys but does not take up all of the room in our small living area. The pad seems comfy and she will be able to nap in it. The toys on the sides are great, she loves to play with the butterfly. I am very happy with this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Very big and roomy. Folds and sets up with ease. My only complaint is that although you can remove the bottom pad, the cover on it is not removeable or water proof, so there is no way to wash it and feel like it's \"clean\". There are sheets for this square play yard to purchase separately, but they aren't all that cheap and sheets themselves are not waterproof. So if your baby soils through his diaper onto the mattress, or your toddler has a barf-fest, good luck trying to get that smell out. You can \"spot clean\" with a warm rag, but lets face it. Poop and puke requires the washer. And you're not able to do that with this pad."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We bought it last week and it was so easy to set up - I only looked at the help on the back of the mat once when I could not figure out why the fourth rail would not lock - turned out they do not lock if the floor is all the way back. Pulling the center up just an inch allowed to lock it and the babe went in. He instantly loved it - he can see everyone through the mesh, he loves playing with wings of two butterflies (rattle and crinkle) and  tries to pick the smiley faces from the mat or kiss them. At 7,5 months old, he enjoys up to an hour  in it playing there on his own (he is not really crawling yet but learned to sit up on his own and can roll around it to reach toys and wings on the side panels. I read some reviews that the floor is not too even, but I did not notice it with mine."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I recently bought this for 7 month old daughter who is just starting to crawl. It the perfect thing to keep her amused for anywhere from 20minutes to an hour! It means I can go to the bathroom in peace and get some chores done knowing she is safe and amused.It is super easy to put together - it literally takes less than a minute - take out of the box - unfold it and it clicks into place. The pictures on the side are of good quality and my daughter likes to pull and play with them.We also have a weekend home - so bought two of these. I would guess this could also double as a crib for the weekend house - ie - for a night or two at a time.Highly recommend for the 7 - 10 month phase of baby's development."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this pack n play!  The other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us (and they were twice the price).... It was the one with a changing table and bassinet.  I finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger, boxier and roomier. My son hates restraints and being boxed in, but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play, and is willing to stay in it for 20-30 minutes at a time (a record!).  And he is 2.5 now, so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere...."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Ok, my 3 yr. old shouldn't be drinking out of a bottle anymore BUT, I have really put these bottles to good use! I have a 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 yr. old still drinking out of these....they have a few quirks but you deal with them and get used to it and LOVE, LOVE , LOVE the ease of use! I do,however, wash the liners sometimes to re-use or I'd be in bankruptcy...Publix and Walmart and other stores have liners you can use when the Playtex gets to be too expensive!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I rated this 3 stars because while it has many good parts, I was highly disappointed to \"realize\" when my baby was 4 months old that this set does *not* include any medium flow nipples. We used the slow flow for several months, so those were useful, but the Fast flow were way too fast and we needed something in-between.  Low & behold I walk down the aisle in Target looking for an entirely new bottle system and I see medium nipples that work perfectly for my daughter.  For trying to offer a variety of nipple options, Playtex missed the mark in omitting the medium flow nipple."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm so glad I chose the Playtex drop-ins system. It is so easy to use. I pump directly into the liners using the playtex storage set and freeze. Then I can just thaw and pop the liner onto the bottle holder and screw on the nipple. The selection of nipples was nice to have, though my guys would take any of them-he isn't picky. I haven't used the tall liners yet though, maybe that is more useful if you are formula feeding? For breastfeeding I recommend the pump and store set and you will be all ready to go!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Before I had my baby, I was thoroughly confused by all of the bottle options available. I started doing research & this one came highly recommended. Now I know why!!!! Hardly any cleaning!!!!! If you're not a complete germ phobe & not super messy while making the bottle, you rarely have to wash the bottles or rings. Just change out the drop in, wash the nipple & you're set. I've only had to wash the bottles or rings when I've accidentally gotten the formula on them. My only complaint is the \"leak proof\" lid. I only tried it once. Put the lid on the bottle & put the bottle in the outside side pocket of the diaper bag. Bag wasn't jostled or knocked around or anything & the bottle totally leaked. So, the \"leak proof\" tops are not leak proof. Still, I wouldn't use any other bottle."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Great set, but you'll need more nipples. At least 2 out of the 5 are Fast Flow, which I didn't use until my baby was 8-9 months old. The nipples are like $4 for a 2pk, so add that to the cost when comparison shopping.Other than that, I love these bottles! I don't have a single complaint about them. I do not use a bottle warmer. They do leak in the diaper bag when not kept upright, but I store mine upright, so that's a non-issue."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got this set at our shower and haven't needed any other bottles. My son started using them at about four weeks old and quickly outgrew the smaller bottles, but the set includes three larger ones, which is great. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that they don't include the medium flow nipples, just fast and slow. My baby was impatient with the slow flow and overwhelmed by the fast, so we had to purchase the medium ones separately. It's also a little irritating to have to keep buying the drop-in inserts, but it does cut down on the dishes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought these as burp cloths for my two boys.As burp cloths they are great - nothing fancy, just good at absorbing the spit up.  The fancy burp cloths are usually too flimsy (won't lay flat on your shoulder) and too thin to be helpful.  These stay in place without having to touch/fix it.I have tried them for cloth diapering but it seems they don't hold very well and leak more than the other diaper inserts I've used. I usually don't cloth diaper so I can't say too much on this - this is just from the few times I have used it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had these exact same burp clothes when I gave birth in 08 to my son so I figured with my second pregnancy I would buy them again big mistake they are made cheaper NOW you can see right through them I am going to have to fold them in half just so it will not go through on to my clothes I do not even think they will make it through a wash load what a disappointment they are worth maybe a dime each at best It is kinda hard to tell how thin they are unless you open the package I would suggest passing these up"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are by far the BEST burp cloths around.  I got several different kinds at my baby shower.  I ordered these after reading the reviews because the ones I received at the shower were paper thin.  These are fabulous.  I buy them for every baby shower I go to now.  The middle panel is very thick and helps with a newborn that spits up a lot and those breastfeeding blunders that happen to a new mom.  I highly recommend them.  They are worth the money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong.  I'd read the directions again and try again.  Another, stinking, melted bottle!  And the milk would be scalding hot.  If it didn't melt the bottle, the milk would still be cold.  I also had a problem with my playtex ventaire bottles leaking from the bottom into the warmer.  Then I had the smell of burned formula in the kitchen.  Oh!  And it melted that bottle too!I'm going back to the old fashioned way.  I'm going to heat water in the microwave and let the bottle soak in it.  It is faster, less messy, and lots cheaper.  Don't waste your time and money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is an awesome product!  Once you get used to using this product, it is a huge timesaver.  It took us three tries to get the amount of water right so the bottle would be the right temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  Before going to bed every night, we put two bottles and the ice pack in the cooler section.  When the baby woke up, we transferred one bottle to the warmer.  It was usually done warming before we finished changing a diaper!  You may want to order an additional ice pack so you'll always have one ready in the freezer.  This bottle cooler/warmer makes it easier at night when you want to get back to sleep as soon as possible!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can't speak highly enough about this chiller/warmer.  Every night I know I will not have to go downstairs to get a bottle, warm it, and bring it back up while baby is crying.Now, all I do is take the bottle from the chill compartment (complete with ice pack), and place it, with a capful of premeasured water, in the warming compartment and hit a button.While I change baby's diaper, the bottle is warming, and I am ready to go.  This equipment has been a godsend.  Actually, I can't think of any equipment that I could live without less.No complaints whatsoever about this great bottle warmer."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have tried many bottle warmers and this is the one we currently use. I liked it because it had a section to keep bottles cold as well. This feature sounds good, but in real life, doesn't work as well as it sounds.The bottle warmer works ok but the heating action is inconsistent even if you get the water level on the meniscus the same everytime. This isn't good for breast milk. Also the heating plate accumulates gunk from time to time.It includes a jar food holder to heat food, but we have never tried it.All in all a decent bottle warmer, but you have have to compensate with a re-heat or cold water sometimes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Ehh, I bought this product to avoid my MIL using the microwave to heat bottles. The thing is that it really depends on the amount of milk and size of bottle. The warmer starts right away and creates a lot of steam. What i found is that a cold bottle from fridge would heat up a lot on the outside but a couple shakes and it would still be cold. I didnt find it evenly heated it through.Its still best to just sit it in hot water for a couple mins. :)But we will use this to keep cool bottles in the freezer pack in the back (remember to freeze the ice pack)-Overall, save your money and use the traditional method."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I use this everyday to heat up bottles.. I like how you can keep the frozen ice pack in with bottles to store and keep cool then just pour a little water into the front part to boil the water.  The directions are a little confusing with how much water to use, so i just have kind of learned how much water we need to use and just keep the bottle in there for 4-5 minutes.. you learn by trial and error.  Or if you want to save your money you can always just boil/microwave water and put the bottle in that.  I got this as a gift at my babyshower and I'm happy with it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The design is convenient, except for the water holding tubes which can be annoying to clip to the sides.  Otherwise, having a cooler right there is nice.  Note that it keeps the bottle COOL, and NOT COLD.  You can order replacement/extra ice pack on Tomy website - we keep 2 extras in the freezer as we constantly were forgetting to refreeze the one we had in preparation for a new night (they were $2 each).  Heating is a bit inconsistent and seems to be slower than the quick pro model by the first years.  Overall, good purchase and the price is great on amazon (you'll pay $30 at BRU)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I can honestly say I love this bottle warmer because it is very convenient for those in a 2-story house.  We loved being able to keep the bottle cool and save the trip downstairs in the middle of the night.  Even when my son was sleeping through the night we still kept his morning bottle in his room and used this warmer to keep it cool.  But...I was very disappointed that my Dr. Brown's bottles were too wide for the warmer.  The taller Dr. Brown's bottle fit in the warmer but were too tall to fit in the cooler.  I ended up still using the cooler but storing the Dr. Brown's bottles in there without the nipple and cap on so they would fit.  My only suggestion would be to make the warmer wider so all bottles can fit."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I loved this product from the moment I got it. It works wonders with drop ins, And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely.... Sometimes that is. We have been using this with ourDr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile. Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate.... Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently. We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day, four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over. Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish. The instructions are basically nonexistent. All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The idea behind this design is well intentioned but I find the design aggravating. Subconsciously I always go for the handle to move this thing, but the handle is connected to the removable bottle storage piece. There's no other way to pick this thing up unless you grab it by the warmer cup. It may seem trivial but I like to keep this thing out of the way (it's an eye sore) and I would have rather just the bottle warmer with no bottle storage chamber.Plus, the heating is inconsistent. No matter whether you put extra water or not, the bottles still don't get warm like they should. When we first got it (4 months ago) the milk would actually be too hot. That hasn't happened in a while."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I only used this pump for the first month as I did not produced much milk but it was great when I used it. As a first time mom, I found it very comfortable and easy to use. I also sterilized the pieces after a day of use and each piece came out fine. I did find that I had to bend forward to get maximum output but it was not uncomfortable. If you plan to do a lot of pumping then getting the double pump might be worth the extra money as it is quite time consuming with only one pump. Overall, an efficient pump, no complaints."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This pump says it's rated for only occasional use, but I used it every day for six months.  The main thing I like about this pump is the ability to use it in any situation.  My husband and I traveled quite a bit with our son and I was able to pump in the car with the battery pack.  I use it so much that I doubt it will make it to our next child, but it's much better to buy this one twice for $80 than to buy one for $350!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this pump for occasional use since I am a sahm.  As recommended by our lactation consultants, I pump once a day.  I sit in bed with my daughter nursing on one side and me pumping the other.  I am able to get 6-8oz in one sitting.  When I pump w/o nursing at the same time, I am still able to get 4oz in 15-20 mins. Being a sahm, I cannot justify spending the $200 for a double pump when I just don't need that much help.I highly recommend this if you are a sahm and can pump whenever for however long.  I pump once a day and after a week of that I have 2 weeks worth of feedings(if giving once a day)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It does the job, but does it make the loudest noise doing it.  My husband said it sounded like I was milking a cow.  I would have opted using a double breast pump, but it was much more pricier.  After two months I found that it was harder to express breast milk using the same suction as before.  I don't know why.  The pump was fine and working the same, even at the highest level, my breast would not fully be expressed.  I had to just ditch this item in the end."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This pump is decent but wasn't enough for me. I am home with the baby so I didn't think I needed one of the larger double pumps since I am not working. However, I needed to pump to improve my supply in the begining and also while I was healing from a cracked nipple and the single pump just didn't cut it. I ended up purchasing the Medela Pump-in-Style and it works much better. Now I use the double pump to fill an evening bottle for my husband to feed to the baby. It would take twice as long with the single pump. I REALLY hate pumping so it is worth everything to get it done in half the time! I think this pump is only worth it if you will rarely need to pump or to use for just a few minutes before feeding the baby to relieve engorgement."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm quite happy with the gate, although I had to spend $250 to make it fit the bottom of my stairs. I removed the left 24\" panel, replaced with an 8\" extension, then inserted 3 more 8\" extensions on the right.  The $30 8\" extensions are way too expensive for what you get I think (and often arrive with scratches and rust due to the extra pole in the box).Like many Kidco gates, the instructions could have been better.  And it would be nice if the mounting hardware were metal instead of plastic.I used a 1/8\" drill bit to create pilot holes before screwing into my banister (rather hard wood).  While it may be obvious to some to do that, others might not know, or might not know what size drill bit to use.  I tried a smaller one at first but the screw was extremely difficult to attach.  Only when I used a 1/8\" drill bit did it go in."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got *seven* extensions for this and put a fence across our den, marking off a one-hundred-square-foot area for the lil'guy to crawl around in. I was worried that the length would make it insecure, but it doesn't: Just be sure not to have the fence completely straight; use the nifty connection corners to alternate turns, using either angles back and forth or a serpentine pattern. Then hang stuff like toys, instruments, and mobiles from it. Our lil'guy loves it! :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this gate!  We have a spiral staircase that continues for 3 floors and it was almost impossible to block off on the second level.  This gate has solved all our problems.The door does not swing closed behind you, which I like.  The bar across the bottom of the door is very low compared to other gates, about an inch.  When the door is closed it is secure, much more so than our gate that swings shut behind you.  The entire system spans 72\" and is very stable, even when my 1 year old shakes it.This gate is a great solution for difficult areas and is well worth the money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great gate, and one of the few with the flexibility to accommodate non-straight spaces. It's pretty sturdy, the kids shake it sometimes but it hasn't ever opened or torn from the wall. The downside (or upside, depending on perspective) is that the gate is harder to open than the previous version. The magnetic catch is handy for a quiet but easy close. I got the extension, and it still stands pretty sturdy. No regrets on the purchase.BTW, this gate works really well as a separate space for an older child to play. We use it for my 3 year old to have a space on the main floor to play with toys without the baby able to interrupt. It's nice because he feels included with everyone else there, but doesn't get upset by his brother knocking down or taking his legos. Highly recommend for that purpose. Looks ok, good if you have white for trim, but ultimately, its a baby gate and looks like one."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have used several other gates to block off the stairs in our home and have been frustrated with them all. My husband and I wish that we had ordered this gate a year ago! It was easy and quick for my handy husband to install at the base of the stairs. The gait opens easily with one hand (the trick is to pull the latch and then LIFT the gate just a bit, which we didn't know to do and initially caused us to think the gate was defective until reading the directions. This feature is nice as our toddler can pull at the latch but can't lift the gate to open it by herself). The gate is also fairly wide, allowing us to pass through it easily, even when carrying things. The gate automatically swings shut, which is convenient, but will also stay open if opened to 90 degrees. Would highly, highly recommend this gate!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have used this gate since our oldest started moving around. Now 3 years and another child later it is still functioning great! It still looks and works as well as on day 1.We picked this for the top of our stairs so we could have a \"landing\" at the top. We did not like other gates where you have to balance on the top stair, with a baby in your arms, to open or close the gate.It is easy to open, but not for little ones. My 3.5 year old still cannot open this on his own.I would buy this same gate in a heartbeat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When I first had this product, I used it on my daughter's crib like it is intended.  Then I realized it could also be placed on the side of the carrying handle on most infant car seats.  I found it worked great if my daughter was fussy in the car.  She loved the soft sounds and musical melodies.  It helped lull her to sleep.  The added light is also a great feature to peak on her rather than turning on the bright overhead light in my car.  Just make sure it is placed securely on the side of the handle to prevent it from falling."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this crib after my son grew out of his Graco travel lite crib (at three months). My son is four months old now and fits in it perfectly and there is still a lot of room for him to grow. It is a nicely made crib and is worth the $80 that it costs. It is so cute and I love the fact that they sell a bedding set for it. We bought the malawi set for it, which looks adorable. I wish I would have gotten this crib from the begining."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!) My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal! I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib. And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My husband and I bought this changing table in the \"cherrywood\". It wasn't hard to put together--my husband put it together in a 1/2 hr or so.  It provides ample space for diapers, burp clothes, blankets, and other items you may need on it.  The table comes with a simple foam mattress, which is easily wiped off with a cloth.  We've been using it everyday for nearly 16 months, and still good as new.  No problems encountered at all."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).  They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket. There was nothing &#34;UltraSoft&#34; or &#34;UltraThick&#34; about this mattress pad, if you could call it that. It's probably the first amazon purchase, after a couple hundred, that really left me disappointed. You're better off putting a thick, soft blanket under your baby's crib sheet if padding is what you're going for. As a mattress protector, it might be good. As a quilted pad to make it softer- it's useless. The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to. My 7 month old wouldn't have even noticed a difference. He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he's older. Guess I'll have to keep looking."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad. I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic. I can't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product, let alone sleep on it! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover. The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking. They are correct! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers, I think there must be a problem with production. Maybe some are leaky, some are not. Fact is, out of ten bottles, five of mine were leaky. I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex. They are half the cost and never leak"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had.  I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed.  I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts.  I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts.  Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles.  I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable.  Well, they are.  They also have more nipple selections, depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle. I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz. cup holder, these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these, couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts (have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i have zero complaints about these bottles. wish i had bought them in the first place (i started out with the playtex nurser system). they may be pricy compared to other bottles, but, you don't have to buy liners for these bottles. my daughter found these bottles much easier to hold herself than the playtex ones and these have a bigger selection of nipple flow to choose from (besides slow and fast, where fast for playtex really just means not so slow), so i put them away and got more of these, and my daugher was a much happier baby.what i found with the leaking some people complain about: if there is any liquid in the seal it will leak. this problem can easily be solved by wiping the inside of the ring that holds the nipple and the outside rim of the bottle with a dry rag, and if it squeaks when you screw the lid on, you're not going to have any leaks.hope this helps!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "In 2000 when my first son was born, I bought the Avent bottles to go with my Isis breast pump (which I LOVE) because everyone raved about how they were the best.  The first time my son tried the bottle with a newborn nipple he couldn't get anything to come out.  After trying for awhile, I finally called Avent and they told me to move up to a different size nipple.  These bottles worked out relatively well after that dilemma.  With me second son I assumed I would use the bottles again and tried the newborn nipple with the opposite result.  The flow was way too fast for him and he would choke and spit out half the milk every time I would try to feed him. I finally gave up on Avent bottles and went with the much cheaper and economical Evenflo Classic bottles (on the recommendation of the lactation consultant.)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "In my opinion the Avent bottle system is superior to any other product on the market. The disposable system works great for storing and freezing milk and it's convenient for Mom's on the go. My only mistake was not buying enough bottles in the beginning when my son ate eight times a day. The bottles are designed to reduce gas, and seem to do the job. The one slight annoyance with the system, you have to place the ring on the lids directly on top of the nipples; otherwise the bottle has a tendency to leak.F.Y.I. - I purchased the adjustable flow nipples when my son turned three months old as recommended, but nowhere in the product information does it tell you that you are supposed to line-up the Roman numerals of the nipples directly in line with your baby's nose to adjust the flow. This makes sense of course, but I had to call the 1-800 number to discover this 'little' detail."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These bottles are pretty good.  The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby.  She makes quite a mess while drinking from these.  However, the bottle is nice and durable.  The nipple and caps fit snug.  Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers.  You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage.  I like that.  My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've only tried the 9oz bottles and they leak for me alot. It's really annoying since I spent so much money thinking that they were quality. They also make alot of noise when my son eats. And he doesn't like the nipple, it's too thick for him to get a good suction. One thing that is good is these bottles don't give him gas which I've tried cheap bottles and he gets gassy with them. After trying alot of bottles the only brand I have absolutely no problem with is the Dr.Brown bottles. They are just the best. But they have extra parts to clean which is a pain."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time.  We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved! No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings.  The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings.  So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants.  Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples. well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window. my daughter had  very bad gas. when i switched bottles the gas stopped. Plus the bottles are  expensive......you  have to keep buying new  nipples there are sooo many different sizes. a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am breastfeeding currently but I do like to leave the house every so often. When I get the chance I'll pump directly into one of these bottles using the Isis pump. I love the nipples of this bottle because they are the most like the human nipple and my baby has not developed nipple confusing because of this. One thing that all Avent users should know...if you read the directions carefully for the pump, the makers tell you not to use anti-bacterial soap on any of their products. Doing so can cause the plastic to crack. I just wash all the parts as directed using regular dish soap and then sterilize all the parts using the Avent sterilizer. That too is convenient and easy to use.I would recommend these bottles to any woman who is breastfeeding and will have to return to work. Yes, they cost more than most bottles, but if you can afford that little extra you will be very pleased with the results."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I admit it: I am impressed with Avent bottles! They are easily one of the baby products capable of handling extremes without a blink. Example: microwave sterilize them and after a couple of minutes, pour a stream of recently boiled water; mix with formula and put next to the ice bin in the freezer for five minutes. Do this with your average bottle a few times and be ready to say bye-bye to them, but Avent bottles hold on strong and in the process also happen to offer the best bibs in the market (the ones that best mimic the nipple, thus giving your baby the least gas, if you feed the bottle perpendicular to his/her mouth). No wonder they've been voted among the best baby products for several years in a row!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This brand of bottles was recommended to me by a certified lactation specialist when I was having trouble with low breastmilk supply and was forced to supplement.  It was extremely important to me to be able to still feed my baby by breast and I was afraid that introducing a bottle to my daughter would cause her to lose interest in me.  I was told that this brand of bottles was created to closely imitate the breast and this is the only brand that you can easily switch baby back and forth from breast to bottle.  And it has worked wonderfully--my baby girl will feed from both without any problem.  I love the shape of the bottles--very comfortable to hold--and they are extremely easy to clean.  Out of the four 4 oz size bottles I own, one of them has a leaking problem, but I can usually solve it by loosening or tightening the cap.  My daughter has no problem sucking from the nipple, as one person reported.  These bottles are great!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Unlike a couple of reviews I read, the only times I've had problems with the Avent bottles leaking is when I screwed the cap on badly or had the nipple in wrong.  Otherwise, they are perfect.  We were told that there may be &quot;nipple confusion&quot; if a baby goes from back and forth from breast to bottle but we haven't had a problem whatsoever.  These nipples are enough like the breast that he does just fine.  (His mouth is open wider than other bottles because he puts the whole nipple in his mouth, like the breast.)  I also use (and love) the Avent breast pump so you can pump right into the bottle and attach a nipple.  It couldn't be easier."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I absolutely love these bottles!!  I've been using them for about 4.5 months now and I've NEVER had a problem with leaks!!!!  I have also never overtightened the bottles!!  I love how they are designed.  Because of their width, my daughter was able to hold them at 3.5 months!!  I also love their 'wide-neck', which makes it very easy to fill the bottle while holding a squirming baby!  They are also EXTREMELY easy to clean!  And they are interchangeable!!  I plan on buying the sippy cup spout in a couple of months so that my daughther can learn to drink from a sippy cup using the same bottle!!! My daughter has also never had colic!! I LOVE EM!!! I LOVE EM!!! I LOVE EM!!!  I also have the breast pump and microwave sterilzer which all fit the bottles perfectly!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "these dont require that extra ring to make it leak proof. i had the originals and they work great too but i like the big capacity but not big size of these. they will leak out of the nipple if it is upside down so if your baby feeds themselves, watch that they dont drop it and wedge it somewhere upside downupdated review***** i love avent NATURALLY bottles and trusted that is what i was getting when i looked at all 12 customer photos. well i broke these babies out to use em last night and they are reg avent bottles with the stupid ring on the inside that makes it not leak(something not needed in the other bottle)the plastic used is also completely different. it isnt the hard clear plastic that doesnt cloud or stain, it is the dull non see through plastic that feels pliable. and the oz numbering on these reg bottles is the kind that will scratch and rub off easily. so disappointed that i now have to return these :("}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great. He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast. We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you. So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter was in the NICU the first day of her life, and then the special care nursery the next few days, so I had to use the hospitals electric medela dual breast pump to express milk. i returned home and rented the medela for a month and hated it. It HURTS my nipples. My friend got me this Isis breast pump kit and I tried it. I LOVE it! I used it since my daughter was about 2 weeks old. I doesnt hurt my nipples like the electric breast pump does as I can control it with every squeeze. It doesnt hurt my wrist (as one might think.) I only supplement my daughter with one bottle of EBM at night. It takes me 10-15 minutes and I can express 5 ounces with this pump! I LOVE IT!Oh, and it is virtually silent so I can pump one breast as I breast feed my daughter on the other!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I mostly use the Ameda electric, but used this on a weekend trip and was very pleased with the milk volume.  I get most of the milk in just a few minutes and the one hand operation is simple.Drawbacks: it can be tricky to get the suction going, but little pumps at first followed by long slow pumps will eventually get it. Also, I've found that I can still get milk out with my electric even after I'm done with the Isis.  It is a little higher maintenance to clean, but I still recommend it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got.  However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day!! Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous. If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping.  On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I read all the reviews on this pump but still wasn't convinced about buying this pump. I originally purchased a Gerber pump and it worked until it cracked. I asked a lactation consultant what kind of pump she'd recommend and she recommended Avent and Medela. I needed a pump in my price range so I chose the Avent.I like how the suction mimics a baby's latch but milk gets stuck everywhere and it leaks all over the place. The pump also makes an annoying squeaking noise and sometimes I lose suction. I'd recommend this pump over Gerber though. I will give it credit though, it's a lot easier to take apart and clean."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Although I haven't been using this pump for very long, I've been able to get very good results. Of course, pumping takes practice but this pump works great for beginners. It is very easy to set up and clean...making it easy to take along. I also like that the bottles fit onto the pump-nothing extra to buy (and clean). I also have an electric pump but prefer this pump when I am home during the day. I find that I can more quickly get it ready and am able to pump one side as soon as my baby is finished nursing on the other side. I definitely recommend having a manual pump, even if you plan on or already have an electric."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The Avent pump in this kit is very good. I also like the carrying bag, which is subtle and good for work - it can even be used as a lunch box when you are done breastfeeding.However, the nipples in this kit are very hard and the speed on the slow flow was far too fast for my newborn (when I tested the milk on my wrist, I didn't get a drop - it squirts). There are better bottles out there too, that keep the baby from getting too much air. Instead of the Avent bottles, I have started using the Playtex nurser system - which means I pump into the Avent bottles and pour them into the nurser (the Playtex system sells a kit with a pump adapter - but it does not work with Avent). This has worked fine for me, though if I were not pumping at work I would not pay the extra money to have the kit. Since I pump at work, the insulated bag is helpful."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my \"let down\" and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I would have been okay with just the table corners. I have a glass table and I was worried about my 1-year-old niece visiting.The corners helped a lot as did putting a tablecloth over my table. There was no way the table guard was going to work around my glass table even with the tape included though. It's for a much thicker table and my glass table was too thin.Also, my niece is still crawling so the guard wasn't necessary. Even when she stood up, she couldn't reach the table and she was safe as houses in her booster seat and high chair."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Other reviews have said that this product is difficult to cut, but I used a pair of ordinary scissors and didn't have any problem whatsoever. Also, the foam is a bit stretchy, so your measurements don't have to be exact. I cut the foam a bit short and then just stretched it to fit. While it's true that the tape won't last forever, it is also true that it won't leave a mark on your furniture once you want to remove it permanently. Simply apply more double-sided tape when the adhesive breaks down. Easy!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Easy to put up, takes a bit of time, but overall fairly easy!  Wasn't too crazy about the type of adhesive that comes with it, but I look at it this way.... I'd rather re-finish my wood coffee tabble than deal with all the boo-boos and broken teeth it(my coffee table) has caused! (I have three kiddos and this coffee table has taken a tooth from two of them before they were 2yrs old)  I'm hoping this protector will prevent that with my third little one! Personally I hate this coffee table, but my husband will not get rid of it... I put this protector on my fire place too, and it looks and feels wonderful.  I like that it streches a bit, and I had plenty of adhesive left over! I rate this product 4 stars, definitely worth the price just know that adhesive is going to be a consern when I remove the product!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Needed this item for our brick fireplace and decided to give it a shot despite some saying that the double sided adhesive tape didn't work well.  I assumed we would try it and then rig something else up (velcro, etc) if it didn't work.  It has been one month and the included adhesive tape is working very well.  My 11 month old goes up to it and tries to chew it (for all the chew toys that child has?!) and it stays put no problem.  Time will tell how long it lasts, but I am happy with the density of the edge guard and how well it went on that even if I did have to do some reworking of the adhesive in the future I would still be happy with the quality of the edge guard as well as the safety the product provides."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am so pleased that the Contoured Changing Table Pad has so many choices in color for its cover! I purchased the lilac, and a white cover and they both go well with my nursery decor. I only wish I got more that two!These terrycloth covers are thick, absorbant and easy on my newborn's skin. The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a little when you wash them. So, when you go to put them back on the pad the fit is a bit tight, but I find they pull out pretty quickly to thier normal size. When they do finally get to small to fit the pad I will go out and buy some more! I mean it's terrycloth, what do ya expect? Besides, the darn things get all kinds of yuck on them all day. They are going to take a beating being washed all the time as it is. They are totally worth the money to replace! I would buy them again!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are easy to put on and take off.  They work well to connect two umbrella strollers.  The rubber inserts do fall out easily, so I can tell these may not last long.  They only work with one thickness of bar so they are not compatible with all strollers.  I use a combination of these for the top connection and a different brand for the bottom that are adjustable since my stroller bars are wider at the base and I connect in 4 places instead of 3 for a sturdier connection."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great booster and is effective for it's job--but there are a few things that could make it an even better seat.  I can't use this booster in my home because it is made out of a rubber substance that my kids LOVE to pull apart!! My young toddler likes to bite and take chunks out of the booster seat.  If you have an aggressive chewer in the house, you may want to think about this--this material is highly attractive to chewers!  Also, the seat does not come equipped with straps.  I had to switch to another booster with straps due to some safety issues associated with this also."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is the best booster seat. It \"grips\" easily to chairs and does not slide. We use it in our captains chairs and our son is great in it! It is the most durable seat too. My nephew has had one for two years or more now and it is still in EXCELLENT condition. It is soft and comfy. It may seem pricey for a booster but it is definitely worth it. It travels easy and wipes clean in a heartbeat. Grandma even bought one to keep at her house for all the kids! Definitely a must have!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We love this booster. My 3 year is still using it and I think he started using it around 18 months or so. We have solid oak chairs and didn't have the problem of other reviewers. It sits in the same chair almost all the time and there's no residue. Maybe it has more to do with the chair finishing. Your chair does need to be made of something to \"grip\" this chair, such as a wooden chair. I tried to take it to my dad's house and he has cooshy leather chairs, and it didn't work. It cleans extremely easily, holds him securely, and works better than I could have expected."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are nice jumbo corners that didn't make our table look too hideous, but at some point your baby's going to learn to pull them off!  This didn't happen for us for a while and I really think any other brands would have the same problem, so this one's the best in the market.  My daughter fell and hit her face on the corner guard and her mouth still bled, though the damage would have been much worse without the corner guard.  It's definitely better to have these than nothing at all."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm not judging anyone else, but I was very surprised when I read how many people wrote about these coming off or being pulled off. I guess my daughter never tried very hard, but they are really stuck tight. I've had one set for about 14 months, and bought a 2nd set for another table about 8 months ago, and they're not going anywhere.  I can't speak to them hurting the finish of the wood, since I've never tried to take them off.  They don't look too bad either, since the dark color matches most of my furniture. I do wish they came in more colors for some of my lighter wood."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This item is not top quality.  I don't have too many of this company's other products, so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will.  First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached, the batteries only lasted through two cd's, the volume doesn't get very high, and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib.  Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same.  You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I thought this would be a great idea. So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them. We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit. I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back. When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped. We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have been using this seat for about 6 months with our toddler boy.  I love how it attaches to the seat easily and securely.  Once it's on, it doesn't budge, but it removes easily.  However, if our son sits down to pee, he gets pee all over the place.  Even with him holding his private part down with his finger.  The cheap \"bob the builder\" toilet seat does a better job of keeping the pee in the toilet while he is sitting.  I wish they would make the seat more compatible with boys."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've tried a few different brands of potty seats, and this is by far our favorite. It stays in place when kids climb on and off instead of slipping or tipping like some other seats. Unfortunately we changed our toilet seat/lid combo to one of those slow close plastic ones that has the removable hinges for easy cleaning, and the Baby Bjorn training seat doesn't fit it. Also, after about three years (and a couple of kids) the black rubber handle on the back started to break, but I consider that minor wear and tear. Overall, I'd recommend this seat above others on the market. It safe and looks nice."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer to potty train my son.  He likes using it, and the splash guard in the front works.  There is an adjustment wheel located at the back of the seat by the handle to adjust the Toile Trainer to the size of the regular toilet seat.  We have elongated Kohler toilets and the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer adjust to fit snugly.The reason I am rating it 4 stars is the adjustment wheel started slipping after a few removal and reinstallations.  Now if I have to reinstall the seat, I pre-adjust it and then position it onto the regular toilet seat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old, and we've reduced the number of diapers significantly, with very rare #2 diapers, woohoo!!! of course i had to hold the baby, but at 11 months, holding is discouraged. there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip, but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets, though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly. (but then if your kid isn't too young, you probably won't need a trainer for a small toilet.) i even take this to other people's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training, and this product enabled me to accomplish that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have 3 boys and this is the solution for our needs. I like it is made of hard plastic instead of the foam type seat, easy to clean. It has a nice shape for sitting. As far as a boy doing number 1 while sitting on the potty, he has to lean forward or you will have a mess to clean up. That doesn't seem to be a big deal to the boys. It has a nice loop on the top so we can hang it on the toilet with the potty hook and it is adjustable to fit different potty hole sizes. Seems very durable. I have one in every bathroom."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Now I know why the cheap potty seats are so cheap. Wish I has been able to see this side-by-side with the cheap ones. If I had this would have been the one I would have bought. This potty seat is well designed, doesn't rock, and is one piece. It's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son's house and the one at my house. My granddaughter wouldn't sit one the \"cheap\" one bought originally but really likes this one. Dry days are coming soon, wish they had these when my kids were at this stage."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have a very large (and very precocious) 18 month boy who is doing GREAT with this! I just came back to order another one for upstairs after carrying one back and forth for 1.5 weeks. Super portable (but easier to have one on each floor!), I've already followed another reviewer's advice to pop it in a tote bag for when we're out and about- that way, he's not afraid of using the sometimes huge potties in stores! I can't compare this to any other seats (well, we also got an actual potty chair just in case, but he's not interested), but this has worked great so far. Very comfy, and no spraying or damaged boy parts- spray guard works great."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Bought two based on a lot of the good reviews, one for our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms. The splash guard can hurt your son. Also the splash guard doesn't work to keep the pee from shooting out from under the seat. If you have a girl it might be for you, if you have a boy don't get this seat. Make sure you read the other reviews about boys and this potty seat. Also the seat is bulky and very annoying to get it to fit each time. This potty seat has discourage our son from wanting to use the potty. If anyone who has had a hard time potty training their kids this will make it so much harder!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When we were potty training our daughter, my friend told me that the toilet trainer that goes on toilet might be better to use over the one that sits on the ground because if they get too used to the one on the ground, they may be scared to go on the toilet since it's higher up.  So we bought this one and even if they are still too small, you don't have to worry about them falling into the toilet because of the way it's made.  My son is 11 months and he can sit on the toilet on this and we don't worry about him falling in.  He may try to get off but we just sit there too and bring toys or things for him to do while he sits there and then he doesn't try to climb off."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Here is what I like about this:- you can adjust some fitting with the turn of a dial on the inside back of the seat so that it doesn't shift when on the Toilet (this way I can use it on different toilet bowls and it sits steady)- just one piece (that way things don't get in between the pieces), less mess and easy to clean- contoured etc and all the stuff they say in their descriptionWhat I wish was different:  I wish that the seat was a little cushioned.  If he's been on the potty for a while, poor thing has red marks on his butt. (it goes away, just don't like seeing that)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have a standard size and shape toilet seat. Yet, this potty seat fits the seat in an awkward manner, causing pee to leak both on top and under the front of the toilet seat. Granted, I have little boys, so maybe this isn't so much of a problem with girls.We had MUCH better luck with the Mommy's Helper Cushie Tushie potty seat (the one with the ducks on it), which is, incidentally, much cheaper and easier to clean. The same unfortunate pee situation never happens with that seat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me.  My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it.  The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his \"equipment\" being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "my son loves it!i bought 4 different brands for him to try out and this is the best one!perfect shape, perfect comfort, perfect size for a 4 yr old. (potty trained now)sometimes, he sits on this for a long time....so i know it's very comfortable....LOLthe handle helps germophobic mommies. and it easy to wash too.the pee cover should be higher though as he has to hold down his thing so as not to pee all over the toilet floor.even with that, it is still a 5 star rating!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This lid is great for my petite 3 year old to use. It adjusts to fit most toilet lids- does not fit well on grandma's already contoured seat. This is a hard, but perfectly contoured seat for a little bottom. We have the cushioned one, with little ducks which is nice, but this is really a step up. It has the nice guard in front to help minimize over shoot. I really liked this one enough to purchase a second for trips to grandma's. It is strong, sturdy, easy to clean. It comes in other colors, but I only have white. It is great how it adjusts to fit snugly with my lid underneath. Since my daughter is petite she has a hard time getting high enough to just sit- she has to \"shimmy\" and this snug lid is very safe for her to shimmy onto with out moving. Worth the extra money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "After 3 weeks of use maybe 1-2x/day, the rubber handle is separating from the rest of the potty.  I just began hanging it from a hook, so maybe that had something to do with it.  This isn't a problem that I read in any of the reviews I perused, and the instructions on the box say to hang it on a hook.  I am returning it and hoping for better luck with the replacement.Other than that, my daughter loves this.  She's 18 mo old, 21 lbs, and fit it quite well.  We only managed to catch her doing her business using it once though.  The product fit very well on my elongated toilet seat and was easy to adjust."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this for use while visiting my parents. It is okay for something like that, but I would not use it for much else.I have a very active 2 year old who does not always want to take time to sit on the potty. She can easily scoot accross the floor while seated on it.It might be good if you have a very early potty trainer or one on the (very) smaller side. My daughter is about 35 inches tall and her knees come to her chest while seated on this."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this potty after reading the reviews and trying to decide on the little or big potty.  I didn't think the small one would be a problem, since  my 18-month old son is on the small side.  However, after receiving it, I would only recommend this potty to those who are doing EC or for travel. My son seems to like it, but he looks huge on it and it will not last for long.  It also slides all over the tile floor like someone mentioned.  I really wish I would have bought the Bjorn big potty."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We take this little potty with us everywhere.  I actually purchased online from Amazon specifically to find the one piece BabyBjorn Little Potty (BBLP) after my friends raved about it.It now lives permanently in the back of my car, so that my toddler can have easy access to a potty when we're on the go.  I've also taken this on planes and trips in our carry-on, so that we would have access to a potty ...even if there was not a bathroom available.  With little ones it is so hard for them to wait, and this helps keep them potty-independent.Also, if you do infant pottying or elimination communication, this is one of the &#34;must-have&#34; pottys.  The seat is a little on the smaller side compared to the standard little pottys you'll find at Toys R Us or wherever ...which makes it ideal for little ones (I am talking 1 year or younger)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We used this chair starting when my daughter was around 8 months old and it was the perfect fit for her.  It was comfortable (or so it seemed) and easy to keep clean!She is 18 months now and we still use it often every day and we have more than gotten our money's worth - but I think she is getting a bit big for it now.  I am eyeing moving up to the regular size Bjorn potty seat, which I hope will be a little more comfortable for her height."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is perfect for my 20 month old.  She can sit on it on her own.  It is VERY small.  Imagine a gallon of milk cut in half.  My daughter is small for her age and it fits her perfectly.  There is no problem emptying it.  We just add a small amount of water and dump it in the toilet.  Then a quick rinse and dump that in the toilet.  This is much better than seats on the real toilet that she feels uncomfortable on.  She is relaxed on this and that makes all of the difference.  It is perfect for us, but be aware it is small."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got two of these after starting EC with my 9 month old.  The potty is a perfect size for a young child/baby who is beginning to use the potty.  My son can't get on it by himself, but can get off...his feet touch the floor when he is seated and he is low enough to reach for toys.  The one piece design is great for cleaning.  Other reviews said that they wished Bjorn would make a clear potty like this which is why I got white (next best thing for seeing when he's done).  If you are considering trying EC...don't hesitate you will be shocked how readily young children will indicate they need to potty and will use the potty consistently.  Great quality product for price!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a no frills, easy to clean, comfortable potty...just as a potty is supposed to be. I wanted something that would be comfortable for her little bumbum but nothing that would distract her from the job at hand. The price was definitely a plus as well. She is 2 1/2 years old, at 29 lbs and 34 inches and is on her way to becoming fully potty trained. Cleaning is pretty easy, I wipe with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes 4-Pack: 1 Fresh Scent, 2 Lemon Fresh, 1 Orange (78 Wipes Per Canister - 312 Wet Wipes Total), wash with hot water and spray withClorox Anywhere Daily Sanitizing Spray, 22-Fluid Ounce Bottles (Case of 9)and let dry or wipe dry."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I own two of these potties.  We're practicing elimination communication and these potties are the perfect size for infants!  I love that there aren't any extra bells and whistles to get in the way of easy clean up.We have one in blue and one in yellow.  My only complaint is that the yellow one came with huge black scuff marks and scratches all over it.  Even with extensive scrubbing, I can't get all the black off.  Obviously, this doesn't affect useability, but I feel robbed paying full-price for something that looks like it's been thrown under a bus.  I'm sure Amazon would have accepted it as a return, but what new parent has the time for that?  Big disappointment!  Especially since the yellow color was sooooo cute!  Way cuter than the blue - which, in comparison, seems a bit dull."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We bought this potty chair after much research and also owning another one - a Winnie the Pooh Potty chair with a removable urine shield that pops off too easily and just asks to be lost.  This chair is so much better that it doesn't even compare.  Our son has been using it to go to the bathroom (so far just pee pees :) ) for several months and loves it.  In contrast, he is lukewarm about the other chair.The best things about this chair:1)  Simple two piece design means that it is easy to clean.  The bowl lifts out and rinses easily.  Other potties seem to have 5 or more pieces, just asking for places to trap dirt.  Not a good thing with a potty2)  built in urine shield (into the bowl) works great and our son loves sitting on it.  It is a nightly ritual before his bath.3)  inexpensiveDownside?  We haven't found a downside yet."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is my second potty purchase and I truly wished it had been my first. My first was the fisher price fun to learn potty, which costs about $5 more and is shaped like a regular toilet with the pretend flush handle. My son thought it was a toy and constantly \"flushed\" to hear the music instead of sitting on it. When this potty arrived and I took it out the box, he grabbed it and said \"mine\" and immediately sat down on it. He started using it the very next day and it's been a success so far. I don't know if it's the potty or if he's just ready to be potty trained (he just turned 3) but I do know that he loves his potty. I highly recommend getting this and forget about the bells and whistles of the fisher price model."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My daughter is on the thinner side and at 18 months struggles to get comfortable in this chair. She's not able to sit on it without falling in. There's no way that she could sit on this for any length of time because she's having to hold her weight so she doesn't fall in. In addition, the splash guard makes sitting on this super awkward. Another mother wrote about how her daughter needed stitches after cutting her genitals on the splash guard. I can totally see how this can happen. It's not safe for your child to independently seat themselves without some help."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I started using this potty with my daughter when she was just able to sit up on her own.  The high back was more helpful then, than it is now, but it's still nice to have the high back.  She likes to lean back and throw her arm over the back.  She thinks she's so cool when she sits on her big girl potty.I like the &#34;handle&#34; on the front shield because my daughter hangs onto it and leans slightly forward when using the potty for #2.I like the design of the bowl and how it fits in the potty.  No leaks.  The potty chair my mom has, if my daughter is at a certain angle somehow it leaks onto the floor.  That has never happened with this potty chair.PROS:- High back to help support baby- No-slip bottom keeps potty from sliding on tile floorCONS:- Haven't thought of any yetI bought a second one of these to leave at day care."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This potty is just great.  My baby has been using this since she was 9.5 months old.  I love the fact that it has a chair-back so she doesn't need me to physically support her when she's on it.  All I have to do is watch her nearby.  It's really well made and very sturdy.  Also, the basin is big enough that it holds everything without spills and mess.  She doesn't mind sitting on it for 10 monutes in the mornings to do her thing...and she does pretty much without fail.  We haven't had to change a poop diaper for weeks now.  One of the most useful items I bought for the baby!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think what makes this potty work well for my twins is the high arms.  They like to sit on it and started the day it arrived.  Also, it arrived in one day.  But they fought over the right to sit on it and I was made to buy a second one.  I have them in white and blue.There is something about this potty that makes a little one understand its purpose.  I couldn't believe how comfortable they are for them sitting on it, due to the arms and back and overall design.  I think the price was favorable and feel great about the purchase of these two potty chairs.They're right now in the early stages of learning.  We'll be using these for awhile I expect."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We owned our last blue babybjorn potty for over 10 years. It survived 4 children.  Unfortunately, it was accidentally cleaned with a substance that ruined the coating.We decided to go with a bjorn again and we are please with this one.  It is a large potty seat so this will fit a large child.  The white part removes easily so that it can be given a quick rinse.A child can lean back and not fall off the potty. The seat is big enough so a child can sit easily without hurting themselves.Overall, I am please with the purchase."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We were using a Bjorn Little Potty (which they don't make anymore) for a long time. But as my son grew, he kept overshooting and it was becoming a problem. At Grandma and Grandpa's house they had the Bjorn Smart Potty, which seemed to work better for him. I figured the Bjorn potties have been working well for us, lets try the top of the line Potty Chair!And its working great, the bowl rinses easily. Sometimes a little pee dribbles over the side, but its easy to rinse the whole chair in the tub. I keep it on a little rug to catch the dribbles and just throw that in the wash as needed. Any potty (with boys using it) is going to have occasional dribbles.And my son was pretty excited when it arrived!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My little two year old daughter is...well...LITTLE.  I bought this potty based on the excellent reviews here and for the most part, it delivered.1. It was relatively inexpensive.2. No bells and whistles to distract.3. Easy to clean.But, being that my kiddo is a shrimp AND a girl, the molded splash guard thing kept poking her in a highly uncomfortable way when she'd try to sit on this thing and it got to the point where when she'd see this potty she'd scream.  As a test, we got the pink girly version of the Summer 3 stage potty trainer and the screaming stopped.I'd recommend taking a look at this thing at a local store before buying.  It's a pretty good product, it just didn't work for us."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles.  There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed.  $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up.  In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase.  The simple design is easy to clean.  My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over.  The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits.  Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds.  My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes.  So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We love this potty chair (bought one for each bathroom).  The design is simple.  It is comfortable and easy to use.  My 2 year old son has had no problems with it.  Very portable (we keep it in the back of our vehicle for longer trips).  We also have the BabyBjorn potty seat which is great as well.  I like having both so my son can choose whichever he wants (he likes both equally).  Made in the USA too!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I picked this potty up 2 days ago and I really can't complain.  My daughter is 9 months old and seems to have no problem with it.  I do understand some of the concerns with pee coming out because it happened to us yesterday.  I didn't make a big deal about it and it didn't seem to bother her.  I happened to have it sitting on a waterproof pad, just incase, so nothing got on my carpet.  But she seems very comfortable on it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to \"keep it all in\" if you know what I mean! =) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore! We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all. This one is truly THE BEST. Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up. It's also a really good size \"bowl\", some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in. AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles, flush noises, music, lights, the works.  Then I thought, wait a minute, the regular potty doesn't have those things.  She wants one like mommies! I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read \"the potty book for girls\" She was immediately  sitting on it without any prompting. Once I finally took her pants off she went right away.  We are still working on going always on the potty, but she loves the potty itself.  It is very basic and sturdy.  My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front.  I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the \"big\" potty."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have two of these - one for upstairs, and one for downstairs. It's great for our 2.5 year old boy who is learning to use the potty, and easy for us as parents to try to get him to use it.Pros:- There's a barrier/guard in the front so he doesn't pee everywhere. It's a huge improvement over other potties - sometimes boys just don't get that they need to hold it down.- The potty part removes easily for cleanup and pouring out.- It has a back so he doesn't fall off of it when trying to sit down. Sometimes sitting is a bit iffy at his age.- It's nonslip on the bottom, so it doesn't push around when he goes to sit.Cons:- A &#34;pour spout&#34; or something would be great along the back side."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We just got this potty after trying the Safety 1st potty for a couple of months. As soon as my son saw it he knew just what it was. We watch the \"Once Upon a Potty\" video and the old bowl style potty in it was throwing him off I think. THis is close enough to that style that he started quoting part of the video upon first site. He then stood up backed up to it and sat down without any assistance, a great improvement from the other potty. He can get up and down from it without maiming his privates. His only problem with it so far is that he's apparently gotten use to having the back pressed against his rear so he pushes all the way back on this potty too. This is a little odd given its oval shaped bowl. Hopefully our stalled potty training will get a jump start down. Just in one day he is much more eager and willing to sit on it and he giggles over quoting the video while he sits there."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38\" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have found that Baby Bjorn potty products are the best on the market and doesn't break the pocket book! It's oblong vs round so urine and poop stays in the pot. The built in splash guard is great! It's easy to clean and light weight, but built tough. Variety of colors. My triplets are all different shapes and sizes. We have a very large boy and has plenty of room for him. Our other son is a bit small for his age and because the pot is oval there is no leg stretching and no \"falling in\". Our daughter is long and very thin. She has no problems what so ever on this! Her tiny behind doesn't fall in or slip or anything. The splash guard never gets in her way! It's just the best! Other moms who see this ask where they can get one! Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This potty works very well for us.  My son likes that it is his size (we also have a potty seat for the toilet which he isn't so into).  It is light enough that he can move it himself, but the rubber grip on the bottom keeps it from slipping when he sits.  I can see how other children may have problems bumping themselves on the splash guard, which you can't remove, but this hasn't been a problem for him.  Also, we have had no problems whatsoever with pee going everywhere as other reviewers have.Pros:Easy to cleanGrips to the floorSturdyGood colorsRounded edgesCons:Can't remove the splash guardInside bowl can be removed easily by the child"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We are taking a soft approach with potty training our 21 month old. He likes his potty chair and can sit on it comfortably, though isn't really using it much yet. Like the chair, purchased 2 of them in different colors, good size for tall 21 month old and easy to clean. I knock off one star only because I can tell the \"splash control\" on front for a boy isn't going to be perfect, but I think that is likely to be a problem with every potty chair out there...and no big deal since I plan to keep the potty in the bathroom only. If we do decide to take it to another room I will absolutely put something under it to protect the floors."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have this potty in green.  I was lucky enough to find it on clearance at a local store by me for $12!!  If I would have known how much I would love this potty, I would have spent the money on it two years prior when we were potty training our first child.  I love the simple design of this potty and that it only has two parts.  It makes cleaning much easier.  No one enjoys cleaning out a potty, but it's so much easier when you only have two pieces to clean.  Our other potty had several pieces with it and a lot of cracks and crevices.  I just wipe this potty up with a lysol or clorax wipe and I'm done!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This thing is the perfect height for the boys (youngest has been sitting on it since he was 18 months, and the oldest is 4.5) to sit comfortably.  It is really easy to clean and there are no crannies for icky bits to get into.  It's pretty unobtrusive color wise, but it is kind of large. There was one incident where my older son pinched his fingers between the &#34;cup&#34; and the base, but he has since learned and we haven't had any more issues.  There is a band of rubber on the base to keep it from sliding around and it does a good job, but it seems to attract all the dust and hair in the bathroom and they stick to it pretty well, so I have to use a wet rag to rub the stuff off it every couple weeks.  Overall, great product and not too pricey."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "fit as expected,,my baby love it .This potty chair doesn't come with all the whistles and bells like other potties. But is the best. When i was shopping for a potty, i read the reviews and then went to the store to &#34;explore&#34; for myself. i wasn't convinced of any other potty. why? 'cause all the others either didn't sit sturdily on the floor (and this is w/o a child sitting on it)or were difficult to clean. This potty is simple and sturdy, gets the job done, comfy (my picky daughter never complained, she likes the teddy bear logo on it), and so easy to clean. Never had a spill too. Besides, potty training should be as simple and natural as possible, so choose a simple potty. i have 2 of this item (1 downstairs and 1 upstairs, now thinking of using 1 at home and 1 for the car).there's plenty of space to stick stickers as a reward everytime she goes potty too"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is my 5th potty chair and so far the best for a boy that I have found.  The pee still splashes out occasionally, but far less than all the other brands.  It makes me so mad that they don't have boy-specific potty's.  The splash guards are always too small and they leak ( like our defective Thomas potty seat)  So I am happy to have this one as a big improvement.  My son is on the large side he is 34 pounds and 36 inches tall and just turned 2 last month. He fits on it just fine and likes that he can lean back."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Easy to clean.The &#34;lip&#34; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty, but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the &#34;bowl&#34; off to pour the contents in the toilet.  Even my 2 (almost 3) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides. Makes it comfortable for the child, especially when we initially began using the potty."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a great little potty chair.  I like its two piece design, and how easy it is to empty.  I like the high back, and so does my son as he likes to \"lounge\" as he uses it.  The only downside is that the piece the comes out does sometimes stick to his behind so when he stands up there is potential for a mess, but this will be true with any two piece plastic chairs.  I really like the no slip grips on the bottom of the chair so my son can't scoot it across the floor.  All in all,  I would probably buy this chair again."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Overall this is a nice little training potty.  Simple design, high back for comfort and easy to clean.  My son seems to like it just fine but I wish it had a taller splash guard.  My son is 20months old, 3+ ft tall and weighs a little over 30lbs.  He fits on this potty just fine but he ALWAYS tinkles over the splash guard so I have to aim his weewee down for him.  I would not let my son use this by himself at this point (we've only just started potty training) because odds are I will end up with tinkle all over the floor."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've had several potty chairs and I'd say I like this one best. It has a high back and armrests, making it comfortable for my daughter to sit. There aren't a whole lot of cracks and crevices, which makes it easy to clean. The chair is sturdy and doesn't tip over. It is larger than some of the other chairs, which were a little too small as my daughter grew. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this chair first._________________UPDATE:  This chair eventually went to my niece and nephew.  It had been a good potty chair and I was happy to share my good find with my sister-in-law.  She agreed it is a good chair."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was the second potty we bought for our son, who is almost 3.  In one word - horrible.  I had a lot of hope that, with all the excellent reviews, we'd find success with this one.  The basic issue is the splash guard, which really doesn't work at all.  Pee still goes everywhere.  I'd love to find one of the old-fashioned potties with the high cupped splash guard - but that's nearly impossible.  If I had known that this potty would be no better than others I've tried, I would have saved my money."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this potty seat. There is no foam seat for the pee to seep into. Just two simple pieces that are so easy to clean. This was the best thing I could have bought for all of our potty training kids. The lip in front looked too high at first. But actually it is perfect. Perfect for girls potty training and for little boys. I would recommend this seat to anyone who has a little one potty training. I just might keep this seat forever....I will have visiting grandchildren someday. :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My husband insisted that our son would potty train with those on the adult toilet seat inserts.  We bought all different types.  Potty training just wasn't working.  I actually researched many of these potty chairs right here on amazon and the Babybjorn had the best reviews and comments, so I managed to convince my husband that we should at least try it.  Best decision ever.  My son's potty training excellerated.  Now he enjoys sitting on this potty.  It's the best height for him and he even likes emptying the receptical into the big toilet.  Easy to clean. Now my youngest likes to just sit on this potty, even fully clothed.  He feels like a big boy copying what his brother does.  Very glad we made the decision to go with this basic floor potty."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This IS a great potty. Easy to clean and simple in design, HOWEVER, if your son has learned to stand up to pee, then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up.  Of course, we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl, but in the meantime, we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty, which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design, and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it.  I would've gotten their one piece smaller potty, however, my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy, so I wasn't sure if he would fit on the seat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Our daughter uses this every morning as part of early potty training. She has low muscle tone, so we needed a potty chair that would be supportive and comfortable enough for her, and this one does the trick. She seems very comfortable sitting on it, I think because of its high back and the little bump in front that kind of keeps her in the right position. I also like this chair because the little potty bucket is smooth, without many little creases, nooks or crannies where, um, germs might get stuck -- so it's very easy to clean. That's a relief for me!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I just received my son's potty chair two days ago and he absolutely loves it.  He sat it in it like a chair for an entire day the first day but when he took a pee in the potty chair, it went all over the floor instead of into the bowl.  The downfall of this chair is that, the front piece that's suppose to block the pee from spilling out, is not high enough.  My son is a 2 year old and he's rather tall for his age but height has nothing to do with the front piece.  It's just not made high enough to block the pee from spilling out.  However, it is easy to clean because the bowl just pulls out easily."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I wanted a small potty chair that would be easy for our 18 month old to sit on. We didn't pressure her to use it, but would casually ask. She would run in and sit on it, read on it, and sing songs. Fast forward to when she is 22 months and she now asks to go potty and will actually use it for that purpose!  Still in the potty training process, but this is a great starter tool.  I specifically got the white with splash guard so that it was the same color as the adult toilet in all the bathrooms and also so we could see if she went."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought two potties before I realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front.  I broke down and bought this.  This doesn't have the bells and whistles like some other potty.  But it's beauty is its simplicity.  he is able to sit and do his business, carry the urine/poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself (he was not even 2 yet!).  I would highly recommed the potty training book \"Potty training in less than a day\".  it's out of print but you might find an used copy on [...]."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is great, partly because it's low-profile and doesn't take up much space, and also (best of all) because it's SO easy to clean!  The plastic seems super-slippery so all potty messes slide off OR are easily wiped away with cleaning solution.  Even the white doesn't discolor over time.  The slight rubber bottom keeps it sticking to tile, so that's convenient.  I would definitely recommend this to any and all looking for a small, simple quality training toilet.  For boys, the pee guard lip works pretty well."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is a child sized toilet.  It is attractive looking.  We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house.  Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it.  I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse.  My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that.  I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet.  We are big fans of this."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We love that this seat makes it comfortable for our little boy compared with the wider conversion style potty chairs (the ones that turn into step stools) because the back is higher and it has arm rests.  Another great perk is that it takes up significantly less space.  Makes it easier to keep it conveniently located for your toddler.  Also, despite its 'lack' of bell and whistles it is easy to clean and safe.  The no skid rubber bottom is an excellent feature!  Highly recommend this potty chair!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Having selected this chair based on the reviews here I felt I should give my own. This was for my first child, now 3 and we bought this over a year ago. He is fully potty trained now and still uses this seat and I think he'll be using it for a while to come. It cleans and disinfects very easily and still looks brand new. He's very comfortable in it and its a very very good fit. It was a year ago, and it still is. For the novice parent of boys, it doesn't matter how high they make the splash guard, boys need to point it down. That took some learning on my part. We have the Bjorn that fits over the potty too, but we've hardly used it. He and we love this one way too much and its so much easier for him to use the potty on his own."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This was our second potty for my daughter as the first one was too difficult for her to sit on. We got it before 18 months and she is very small for her age, the other potty we had was &#34;the shortest on the market&#34; but bc of the design she had trouble. She had loved this potty since day 1 and she likes the little bear logo on the front. The only downfall ivories would be she can grab the basin and easily pull it out but she is pretty good about letting me do it. Like the gray color too."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was looking for a potty to use for baby potty training, he's 6 months old and in the 25th precentile. I saw that some people commented that it was small, which is what i was actually looking for, and it works great for us. The back is great, he can sit on quite comfortably, so long as I entertain him!He has used successfully, and it's really easy to empty. I just add some water if needed and flush it, the seat just lifts out.There is an imprint on his bum after he gets up, but he doesn't seem to mind.Here's a tip: since he still pretty short and his feel don't reach the floor, I use something to put his feet on for leverage, and it really helps. The baby wipes container is perfect."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased these in the hopes they would work for our newborn.  Unfortunately, I haven't even given birth yet and I already know they're not going to hold up to the demands of a newborn wetting even once in them.The pros: inexpensive.The cons: These diapers are horribly rough, even after a washing.  The fabric is fraying and even triple folded, these things do not hold liquid.  Since I'd already washed them I figured I could at least use them for dish towels, but they merely move the water around on whatever surface you're trying to dry, they don't absorb.Save your money and skip these...and buy a higher quality cloth diaper."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "A friend recommended I register for these although she knew I was planning to use disposable diapers.  I accidentally registered for the diapers with the absorbent centerfold, and fortunately,  received these.  They are large -  27\"x 27\" square and are essential for baby care.  I still use them every day and my son is almost a year old.  I used them to line his cradle and changing-table when he was first born and going through many diapers a day.  They work great as burp cloths, and are superb for wiping up other food messes.  Additionally, I found they work as a light blanket during the summer months.  Extremely durable, fold-up rather small for travel, and launder well.  101 uses, I love them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I do not use these as diapers, but I couldn't live w/o them.  When my baby was really little, I used them on the changing pad to keep from having to change the changing pad cover constantly.  These are much easier to change and wash than those covers.  These are also the best burp cloths.  My daughter has really bad acid reflux, and not many burp cloths can stand up to a good spit up.  I go through about 5 a day.  They are VERY absorbant!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was very disappointed in this product. It was highly recommended by the hospital, so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born. After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks, I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple. We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those, either. We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium. She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those. Now she's a pro! (Anyone need my Medela set????)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right?  Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding.  Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now).  I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage.  I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These bottles are great but are very pricey.  I have a 2 month old and I was producing more more milk than he was drinking allowing me to store some in the freezer.  I was hesitant to use the bags because I was afraid they would leak so I found myself wanting to buy more bottles, but for $18.99 for 6, I needed to find another alternative.  I did some research and found bottles made my Mother's Milkmate (mothersmilkmate.com or on ebay) These bottles are compatible with the Madela breast pump and nipple rings.  The refrigerator storage system is great too, you have to check out the website to understand what I mean.  If you love these bottles, you've love the milkmate ones as well.Hope this helps and saves you money!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got the Medela bottles because I intended on breast feeding my child. Unfortunatly I was unable to do that. But these bottles work wonderfully with formula!My daughter retains much less air with the Medela nipples and she seems to prefer the shape as well. I found that when I sterilize Gerber nipples they become \"gummy\" and \"sticky\", but the Medela brand holds up very well in our sterilizer.I think the Medela bottles stand the test of time, which ends up saving you money in the long run and my baby LOVES them!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I use the pump-in-style advanced breastpump, and I really like that these bottles screw right into the pump assembly.  I like having many bottles on hand so that I don't need to wash them every day.  I don't freeze my milk in these (I use Gerber bags), but they're great for temporary storage until pouring into the feeding bottles.  I use Avent bottles as my baby seems to like the shape and flow of the newborn nipples (these nipples seem too fast-flowing)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "i got these to put on my bed for my son's morning massage-cuz by now it's no secret what little boys do once those nappies come off! the first time i used it i seriously used the expression \"let's see how good these really are\"...only to be terribly disappointed: upon turning him over (yes he did let out a dose)i found i had really let my child lay in a puddle!! this o so absorbent pad really did nothing but allow for a greater area of redistribution. i even ventured to put my hand into it to see how much was absorbed n literally had stuff dripping from my fingers!!this was a waste of my money. i am back to using a regular sheet folded over."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love these pads! After reviewing many reviewers I decide to buy one and try it. It is so soft and absorbent! Mine has not pilled and has gone through many washings. I ended using it in my diaper bag since the changing places in public restrooms don't always appear clean. It fits so much better in my diaper bag than a bulky changing pad and my daughter likes better since not cold. I bought more of these and left one in her cosleeper for leaks and as a changing pad at night so no trips to nursery. Another was placed downstairs with wipes and diapers in a basket for quick changes on the couch and everyone loved using them.Great price and you will get your moneys worth out of them. They go anywhere and we left one at grandmas and one in the car for changing on the seat when not convenient to change elsewhere. Will use for next bundle of joy!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have 2 packs in different sizes. On the package it's advertized as a burp cloth. I've used it over a pillow on my lap, but it's too stiff to use over your shoulder. It's good at trapping moisture and keeping the surface beneath from getting wet or damp. It stayed strong after several washes. I used to lay my daughter on it to protect her mattress or sheets, but I find that it doesn\"t breathe well enough and when she had baby acne it made the break-outs much worse."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "What I like about these pads are the way the don't slip around at all when you lay them down on carpet or flannel sheets.  My daughter has started resisting being changed on her changing table, so I use these pads to change her on differnt floors in our house.  And awhile back when she had a particularly upset stomach and lots of diaper blow-outs we kept her on top of these pads all day, whether she was sleeping in her crib or anywhere.  They worked wonderfully.  They come clean easily and I don't mind that the cotton pills up.  That helps to keep it from shifting on carpeted floors."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This pad is perfect for our playard. I put it under the sheet and I have no worries about trying to clean the matress board since the material cannot come off. It is very soft, provides an extra layer of padding since playards are so hard, and it can be washed and dried in the machines no problem. Even when we go on vacation we pack it up with the playard. Great investment for your babies saftey, babies confort, your sanity (when trying to wash the playard matress), and what makes this even better is the price!!!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have tried so many sippy cups over the years and these are the best. My kids are 6 1/2 years apart and I used these sippy cups for my oldest. For my second child we used Nuk silicone spout cups for awhile but he kept chewing the spouts. They were getting expensive to replace. I tried other hard spout cups but he didn't like them. I remembered my daughter liking these and looked around but couldn't find them. Looked on Amazon and so glad that I found them. My son loves these. They are easy to clean, don't leak and he happily drinks out of them. I have ordered several packs of them. All have been the blue and green as pictured except my last order I got purple and orange prints. I highly recommend these cups."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've been using these cups since my son was around 8 months.  He had another sippy with a silicon tip and handles at first, but we wanted to introduce a cup that he could use for many years to come.  This is it!  Cups with silicone tips WILL leak if they get bent.  I can throw this cup in the diaper bag and not worry that it's going to leak.  It hasn't leaked once.  I love that this cup will fit in most cup holders.  It's super easy to clean with it's THREE parts.  You can use them as regular drinking cups for older kids."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "While I agree these cups don't leak, they are difficult to get clean. The underside of the lid has crevasses around the mouth bit that are deep and narrow and almost impossible to get really clean.  I have been using ours for awhile and regularly sterilizing in boiling water, but the residue build up in the lid has gotten to the point where I have to toss them and buy new sippy cups. Too bad, as they are great in the no-leak department. I will be buying a kleen kanteen sippy--no leaks, stainless steel and easy to clean."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is great! It's so much nicer than the hard plastic tubs. My 6 month old doesn't slide around in this and it's easy for me to rest my arm on the tub while washing her. (Couldn't do that with the plastic tub.) Easy to fill up and easy to clean up. It even has a suction cup so it doesn't slide around in the tub. (I also use that for hanging up so it dries out after every bath.) This tub just makes bathtime much easier!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was worried about this purchase reading all the reviews.  So far so good.  My 9 month old son loves the water we use this in the tub for bath time where he splashes and has fun. I bought the Safety 1st Splash Infant Bath Cushion, Blue to go in it.  I use that sometimes as I don't find the bottom of the tub that slippery, my son stands up in it and doesn't slip.But I was worried about safety so I purchased the cushion.We also use it for a swimming pool, sort of.  We have had some very hot days so I take it out side on my deck putting a old blanket underneath & he just sits in it and plays.I like it also when he has diaper rash as I can put the baking soda in the water to help dry it up and the height of the tub allows me to get it high enough over his butt."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I couldn't find anywhere--not on amazon nor on the product or its packaging--what this tub is made of, but I suspect it might be made of PVC. It has a strong new-shower-curtain/new-pool-toy smell when you first open it, and I let it air out for a few days before using it. The smell is gone now, but I would have loved it if this tub were made of a less smelly (and probably more eco-friendly) material.Also, the tub doesn't fit directly under the faucet--half the water goes in the inflatable tub, and half of it goes between the inflatable tub and the side of the bathtub. I fill a large plastic bowl with water and dump it into the tub to fill the tub.Other than these issues, the tub is ok. The size is good and it does the job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We used this tub for my baby from about 7 or 8 months old until about 13 months.  It was a great transition from our infant bathtub, giving her more space without using all the water that a full bath would require.  It only took moments to inflate by mouth, and I never needed to add more air.  I liked being able to use the tub in the middle of the big tub so my baby was never in close proximity to the faucet or water controls.  The vinyl is a nice quality, and I ended up using it outdoors as a small wading pool at my mother's house after the baby outgrew it for bath purposes.  Once she started walking it was not long that she learned how to climb out of the sides, but I'm very happy with the job that this tub did for the months we were able to use it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got this for our 7 month old twins who have just started sitting up alone but are still a bit wobbly.  The tub is really cute but the bottom panel on the one we got had a leak and would not stay inflated, which completely defeats the purpose of creating a soft surface for them.  We ended up putting the infant bath sponge that we used when they were newborns in the bottom and sitting them on that.  They had a great time splashing and playing.  It's a great tub if you get one that holds air."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm very satisfied with this affordable blow up tub.  The bottom part under the baby's butt blows up separately than the sides, which is nice because my 6 month old was unstable sitting on the blown up bottom at first.  She loves the ability to play in the water in here, I just have a hard time keeping her sitting in the tub, she keeps wanting to stand up and climb the bathtub walls. I think that's more an issue with my very active daughter than the tub though :)"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The DEX Pillow is great.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am 21 weeks along.  The pillow is not overly big and fits nicely under the belly.  I tried the fully body boppy pillow, but had trouble sleeping with it and I had trouble with having to adjust it again after turning over.  This pillow is easy to change sides with.  Before pregnancy I slept on my belly.  I find that this pillow has really helped me transition from being a belly sleeper to a side sleeper."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think we bought this for $8. I was in the market for a snoogie but couldn't bring myself to pay $60 for a pillow I would only use for a few months. I am 7 months along and I didn't realize that I needed to 'lift' my belly a bit. Works great. A lot more sturdy than I thought. I'm glad it's not memory foam because I need a 'lift' not to sink in. I gave it 4 stars only because I have 2-3 more months to go in my pregnancy.A great buy! A great little size that does the job."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this pillow and when it arrived I was disappointed. I purchased it intending to use it to prop my torso up at night during my 2 trimester. It was much smaller than I realized and tossed it aside. A few weeks later I started using it between my knees while I slept on my side. I also used it under my growing belly so It wouldn't hang. I found myself using it behind my back during TV time and also in the car. I used it all the time. Right now, I am letting a friend borrow it for her back at work since she is in her third trimester. I would recommend this pillow to anyone so has back issues or is pregnant. The case comes off so you can clean it too."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This pillow is smaller than a standard sized bed pillow.  It is just enough to wedge under my hip & keep me off of my vena cava (now 7 months along.)  It does not solve all of my comfort issues, but it gives me peace of mind that I'm not laying flat while I sleep (which I find myself doing without it.)  It seems like it will fit perfectly in my bassinet after the baby is here to elevate her head.  And when I'm done using it for that, it will make a perfect knee-separator pillow.  I have already gotten my $10 worth & forsee using it for a long time to come."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help.  However, this didn't really help me sleep better at all, if anything it made it worse.  It was very uncomfortable.  Maybe I'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger.***UPDATE***  Now that I am 33 weeks, I use this support pillow every night.  Once my tummy got bigger, the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much.  Now I can't sleep without it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This headrest is perfect.  Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this.  When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward.  Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy.  At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this.  I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible.  It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car.  For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams. I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump.  I really didn't like using them with the twist ties.  That didn't make sense to me at all.  I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better.  They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup!I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "If I had to freeze breastmilk, this was great because I didn't have to put a lot of plastic containers in the freezer (we could use them to feed the baby instead).  They were easy to dispose of if they outdated (there is a place to label them with the date).  I usually put 3 of them in a freezer bag as a double layer of protection against leaks and freezer burn.  None ever leaked for me.  They thaw easier and faster than in hard plastic or glass containers, too.  Very convenient."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this gadget.  I bought two extra bases for my infant car seat for both my husband's and my mother's car.  Unlike my car, there center seat has a harness strap.  Those are hard to get really tight.  My center seat has just the lap belt and it was easy to secure the base.  With the harness strap it was just too hard to get the seat in tight enough.  With the mighty tight, it was a snap.  You just hooked it in, cranked it, and voula!!!That seat isn't going anywhere.  I love it.  It is easy to use, it makes the seat secure, and it is sturdy.  You must have this if you are trying to secure a seat in a position with a shoulder harness."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We had gotten this seat belt tighter for both our cars - a Subaru Outback and an Audi A4.  For the Subaru, the Mighty-Tite was too bulky to work well - it was pushed up against the car seat and it was difficult to tighten completely.  It fit well on the Audi, but when we got our car seat installation inspected, the police office checking our seat said that she did not recommend this product.  She has actually had one break while installing it!  Since it is not made by the car manufacturer and not made by the car seat company, you should be wary of being lulled into a false sense of security just because you have this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet.  Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality??Also, keep in mind your wash loads.  I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels.  Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry.  Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth. My nipples were raw, sore and a little bloody. Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples.  My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture.  To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts. Ouch! I found the smooth, cool lycra of my bras was better. A waste of money!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they've worked great. They're easy to wash and dry, I just throw them in with my regular clothes. I didn't give it 5 stars because you can't wear these with thin clothes or they show. I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way, but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show. I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use. I bought two packs and might get another one so that I don't have to wash them during the week. Why buy disposables? Seems pretty wasteful to me."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it...loved it! Ordered one for myself and cant do without. Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state! Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product...also...If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born..keeps me from being sore! You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold.I own the pump in style advanced... get this one, its worth every penny!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This nursing stool drastically improved the usefulness of my old-fashioned rocking chair as a place to nurse my newborn. Prior to the stool my lap was slanted in a way that made it difficult to position baby and my back was leaned too far back to be useful. The stool converted my lap into a flat horizontal stretch that could support my baby and improved my posture so I didn't end my sessions with a backache. However, I also found it useful while nursing on the couch or other armchairs (same benefits) and my husband loves to use it when he is getting baby dressed after a bath as it helps him keep his lap horizontal as well. An added bonus is that it is incredibly easy to put together (5-10 minutes tops) and comes with it's own allen wrench tool."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Can't say enough good things about this stool. I used one at my lactation consultant's office and found it really helpful. It gets your body in the right position and makes nursing so much more comfortable. It's well made and easy to assemble. I am not too tall - 5'3\" with legs on the shorter side. Maybe if you have longer legs you don't need a stool, but I would recommend it to any new mom planning to breast feed. In my experience, anything to make those first few weeks easier - while you and your baby are learning to breast feed - is worth it!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been having horrible back problems since the third trimester of my pregnancy. And things got worse when my son was born. I simply could not get comfortable while breastfeeding, and was having trouble maintaining good posture, so my back was getting worse and worse. I ordered this stool thinking it would help me get comfortable and sit straight. Unfortunately, it has not helped me at all.I think one main problem is that I am very short: 5'1\" and change. When I sit on my couch, my feet don't reach the stool. So it doesn't help me there. While I sit on the miniature recliner in my baby's room, my feet do reach, but the sticky pads on the feet of the stool are not sticky enough. So if I put any weight on the stool at all, it slides away from me in seconds.This is a nice product, and well made. I just wish it worked for me. :("}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I didn't think a stool could really make it more comfortable to nurse, but I was wrong!  I used this with an old rocking chair and found that my legs were much more comfortable when propped up - especially during those long nights of rocking!  The stool is well-built and comes ready to use in the box.  The natural wood color is attractive and goes with nearly any decor (just so happens that my crib and baby armoire are also natural wood color).  I imagine this would be a great stool to use if you were nursing on a chair or couch that was stationary as well."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Once you have this stool, you will use it long after you stop nursing. It is wonderful for just propping your feet up while reading, watching TV, doing needlework, and much more. I have a rocker/glider that I use in my front room and the gliding ottoman is just awkward and bulky. I was using a regular child's step stool but have had to tip it onto two legs and I'm starting to notice some wear on my carpet. It is also easier to pick up and move out of the way than the ottomans or switch to the couch."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I registered for this stool when pregnant, thinking it would be a nice position-helper while breast feeding, and it is, with one drawback: it tips easily if you put any weight on the edges (top edge or either side). So far, this hasn't been a huge problem, except for making a loud THUMP every time I do it, which sometimes startles the baby. I would just suggest that you avoid ever using it as an actual stool and never step or stand on it, and keep any little kiddos away from it too.Other than the potentially dangerous tipping thing, it is a nice wood piece and went together very easily. As stated before, I would not use it in place of a safer flat stool, but it would be absolutely great under a desk to prop up your feet while working."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have a white crib and the last set of these I bought (years ago) were discolored. These are clear, and look and fit great on our crib. You should definitely measure the width and thickness of the area you want to protect though. I know some people did not, and wrote poor reviews about it when it was clearly buyer error. Our son figured out how to remove the other ones we had, but not these. So far, our nice crib is saved, hopefully for baby #2."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are great if you have an infant who learned to stand up in their crib and decided it was time to sharpen their new teeth on the rails (which I think almost every infant is!). in other words these are a must. I have only 1 problem with these (hnce 4 stars). no mater how you try to group them, they do not cover the entire rail on any side of my baby's crib (standard size). At least 2 inches on each side are still left bare for her to chew on. The company should change their length in order to be able to provide complete coverage at elast for standard crib sizes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I liked this product because it's a good rubbery material to chew on, but it only fit on the sides of our crib as the front bar is much wider. I had actually gotten these & put them on when my daughter was in the crib, but after being on a few months, they almost looked kind of liquidy underneath and when I went to remove them, they removed some of the wood varnish as well, so I left them on to look better. My daughter actually never did bite on the crib railings but my son does (3yrs later) and prefers chewing on the front bar best, of course. At least the side bars they fit on will not be used when it's converted to a full size bed, but there will still be those teeth marks on the bed footer. Oh well, it's kind of cute. I plan to use one of those wood color markers to cover the teeth marks if it really bothers me."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I like the idea but in reality didn't work for us.  We would have had to order 3 sets to cover the 4 sides of his crib which gets pricey. The length (from top to bottom) is not enough for his crib either - his rails are more like 2 or 3 inches.  So he can get his bottom chompers underneath these and still go to town on the wood. And of course he pulls them off easily and throws them to the floor too (11 months).  I'm going to order some cloth ones that can be safely tied on-not interested in a DIY project when it comes to ties and cribs."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have a basic single row power strip, and i couldn't shut the smaller side door or it would depress the power switch... therefore making this completely useless to me.The snap buttons are hard to open and close, so it would be good to keep little fingers out, but i just couldnt use it for my power strip.The stip i have is SIMILAR to this one,&lt;...>but not exactly the same. Mine is dark color and newer looking with spots labeled \"adapter\" so you can plug in large plugs and not lose any outlet space."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We are fortunate in the design of our computer desk.  A baby safety gate did the trick for us. Instead of installing a power strip safety cover, I purchased an inexpensive tension safety gate (ten bucks) and pushed it way back under the desk against the wall with all the cords and boxes (routers etc.) behind it.  Keeps his little hands out of everything and I still have room for my chair & feet.  Still trying to find the best solution for protection for 2 other strips in our home. Seems like nothing is perfect."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Great Idea. Doesnt work on plugs that are bulky and go sideways. But will work for most plugs even some large ones. The reason i gave it a 3 stars is because two reasons.One the wires come out the top making it hard to put them in a cord hider. Two bc they do come out of the top by daughter can still grab and chew on them. Would be better if they had the wires group together out the side. I saw a more expensive version of this that did that."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This is one of the worst products created for child safety. It didn't fit our standard power cord, the front section opened really easily (actually had a hard time getting it to stay closed) and once we opened the back section to plug things in, couldn't get the back section closed again. Also, the opening at the top is huge! Definitely big enough for my 9-month old to stick her fingers in, which is kind of the opposite of its purpose. I sent it back and moved around furniture to hide our power cords instead."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We got this for the power strip in our livingroom by our tv.  It does a great job of hiding the strip and the plugs and I like that you can open the part of the on/off switch separate from the section where the plugs are.  But there also lies the problem with this.  The clips on the side are not easy to reattach.  So as long as you don't plan on opening and closing this a lot then it works great.... but if you need a cover over a strip that you need to access a lot, then this one will most likely frustrate you quickly!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It's not flimsy to me at all.  Maybe because the carpeting in our apartment stabalizes it, but it's perfect.  I also think it's very pretty - it brightened up the room.  I just love it.  Makes me want to further decorate the room for the baby.  Perfect height for me as well and plenty of storage room.  I do wish the pad furnished was a bit thicker and softer but it's sufficient.  I like how it's covered in smooth vinyl so we can clean it very easily.  Great table for a great price!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this changing table at a used baby store because I recieved the crib as a hand me down. Even being used this changing table is great. There are no problems. It's very sturdy and durable for the price. I have the shelves loaded up with alot of things and no problems at all. The shelves are made of a type of posterboard wood but they are sturdy. The pad that came with it is very thin and cheap so I purchased a better one. But this changing table is definitely worth the moderate price."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was going to get the \"spindle\" changing table from POttery Barn Kids but found this one, at about 1/3rd of the price. This one is even better b/c of the rail that goes around the actual changing area.. i do recommend a contoured changing pad with a comfy cover. i have attached a crib mobile to this table to keep katie happy during diaper time. this changing table looks good in her room, i also bought the Jenny Lind crib. i did get the baskets from PBK to store stuff neatly on the shelves. The only complaint that i have is that the shelves are basically hard cardboard, but dont let that discourage you b/c they really are sturdy and as i mentioned i've got baskets on the shelves so you really dont notice."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These drop-ins are okay - they are not an improvement over an ordinary bottle. Yes, I can simply throw these liners away after using them, but since I still have to wash the bottle's nipple, this system does not save me any time. I use these liners in conjunction with my bottle warmer and they don't melt, which is good. I bought the Playtex Drop-In system to try to reduce the amount (frequency and quantity) that my baby spits up. However, the amount of spit-up is the same - not better, but also not worse."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These are so easy. I don't have to wash a million bottles anymore! I just have to wash the nipples. The only complaint I have is that I pre-fill with water and dump in the formula when I'm ready, but when I put in the 8 oz. and let the bottle sit for a while, the bag expands a little so it only looks like I have 7 oz. So the measurements may be a little off. I would use a measuring cup to make sure you get exactly how much water you want and not rely on the liner's measurements."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have twins so when purchasing products, it was all about investing money in things that would make our lives simpler.  These Drop-Ins work really well for the bottles. The bag collapses as they consume the contents, which supposedly improves problems with gas but I'm not sure this system accomplishes it better than any others. Because the bag is thin, it also takes a lot less time to warm bottles if that is a consideration. The real savings is the manpower and time necessary for cleaning. I only have 4 bottles per baby, replace the liner and nipple when necessary, and wash everything once a day.  These don't come cheap so I don't think there is any cost savings associated with this versus buying a boat load of bottles."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Couldn't find this in stores around my area. But I've used this before and they're great. It's convenient and it minimizes the need for a lot of bottles and best part is they're disposables. I never had problems with this drop-in liners before although I did read another review that there's another liner that can be used with the drop-in nurser bottles, just as good if not more effective, cheaper and more count. Regardless, this has my stamp of approval and I would recommend this for new parents."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love the drop-ins system.  I used them for my first daughter when I went back to work and my family who watched her loved the convenience of them. I am using them again for my DCP for my second daughter. There is less washing needed during the day as the bottle doesn't get dirty.  I have never had an issue with these and was happy to find them on Amazon!P.S. There is also a system you can buy to pump directly into the bottles.  It was cheap and saves a step!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love these liners. They are a quick and easy way to ensure a sterile container for my milk. I have never had a problem with them leaking except for one time when I was squeezing the air out, squeezed a little too hard and POP!!, breastmilk everywhere. I learned my lesson- squeeze gently, if at all. My only complaints are: 1. They are a bit pricey for plastic bags but the convenience factor makes up for it, imho. 2. The amount markings on the bags are a bit hard to read and don't really line up with the markings on the nurser shells, so the only way I can tell how much my LO has taken is to pour out and measure the leftover milk. Otherwise, this is a great product!!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We've been using these and absolutely love them! So much easier to clean than other bottle systems. Can easily remove all air to improve gassiness and colic in little one. Just press in the liner from the bottom. We are currently supplementing with formula and only using 2oz per feeding in a 4 oz liner, and it is still easy to remove the air.With the ring and nipple loosely on the bottle we carefully press on the liner from the bottom until the liquid level nears the top of the liner. Then we tighten the lid and continue to press any remaining air out through the hole in the nipple (be careful when pushing up on the liner before tightening the lid as liquid can easily overflow). If your fingers are not long enough, we sometimes use the handles of some of our kitchen serving utensils to aid in removing the air."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We used the playtex drop in bottles for our daughter and I do not have one bad thing to say about them.  They made my life a lot easier by cutting down on the washing of bottles.  You just drop in the liner and throw it away after feeding and the only thing you have to wash is the nipple.  No taking apart the bottle and washing several parts.... Just quick and easy.  We used the Madela bottles at first but she was having a few problems (too much air) but we did not have any issues with these.  We order all of our baby stuff on autoship (including the liners) and the price is unbeatable."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love the drop in system bc although you have to buy liners, it's easy, sanitary and really helps reduce air intake. My only issue is when I put the liner in and use the bottle to measure- it's slightly off so I have to pull the liner out and check the (example) 6oz mark and I am using the bottles that are made for expandable liners so something is off and I like to be as precise as possible... It's  not that big a deal but I wish the bottle lines and liner matched perfectly."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I measured 8 ounces in a measuring cup, then poured it in the liner, and it was a little below the 8 ounces mark on the liner. I tried it again with a different measuring cup and received the same result. You can not put the liner in the bottle first to fill it up, because the measurements on the bottle do not match up with the measurements on the liners, My husband always has a hard time filling up the liners because it is hard to hold it and add water since they expand. Also, the numbers on the liner are very hard to read."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "When used with the slow flow nipple and the breast pump adapter kit this is the closest to breastfeeding as you can get.I bought the breast pump adapter kit and now i pump in these bags and never have to use a bottle holder at all.no more milk transfer from bottle to bottle, and no more air at all.  you can squeeze all the air out of these liners.take a look at the images to see step by step how i connect this to my pump kit and using the adapter rings and caps store, and feed without the need for the nurser bottle to mimic as close to mommy breastfeeding as possible.  For medical reasons my baby could not latch and this allowed me to bond with my daughter and have gas free feedings and be literally as close to breast as possible.  Check out the images - you will see for yourself this amazing way to nurse your baby."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have been using those for months and will keep using them. They are convenient because it is easy to prep a per-sterilized bottle without having to worry about cleaning bottles. I usually rotate with 4 nipples so I always have at least one clean to put on the bottle and it is ready.The bags don't seem to collapse as the milk is drunk. This might be more an issue with the bottle itself than the drop-in.First few times I wasn't careful in positioning the drop in and ending up pouring the most of the milk on baby due to a bad leak. After doing that twice I was more careful in positioning the drop-in.Conclusion it is a great idea, time saver on cleaning."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "These liners are a great idea in theory. I only use them because my baby like the latex nipples and not many other bottle brands have latex nipples anymore. The measurements are a nightmare, I have to guess how much breastmilk I am pouring in the bottle. The only thing that helps is that I pour it in from a lansinoh storage bag and that gives me a better idea of how much I am putting in.With regards to leaks and the liner lip pulling free and falling out, I only experienced that with the 4oz liners but that was because I was overfilling them. However I am always worried about this happening so I screw the nipple on very carefully. It would be great if the nipple ring was clear so you could see if the liner is on the verge of pulling free or not."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This product works directly with our Medela breastpump with the use of adapters that come with the breastpumping kit.  It is nice not to have to transfer the breast milk from one container to another.  I cannot comment on the freezing aspect since I did not make enough milk to be able to freeze.  The only downfall to the liners that we found is measuring out the quantity is not accurate if the liner isn't fully expanded.  We measure in a different container and pour into the liner.  The best part about this system is that we are sure that the container holding the milk is clean- we just don't trust a regular plastic bottle to come completely clean.  Our other bottles are the good old fashioned Evenflo glass bottles.  All in all, we recommend this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love these and will be buying more.  I like that is made of tissue paper and nothing plastic.  They absorb pretty well--I admit that when my son decides to pee in the middle of a diaper change the sheet does get wet very fast, but 95% of the time it doesn't leak into my changing pad sheet. I usually throw away the wet peewee pad right away so it doesn't have time to leak anyway. These really are a lifesaver and save me from excess washing of the changing pad cover. I only wish that Amazon sold the 108 ct instead of just the 36 ct pack."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Very handy item to have available. Heats faster than boiling and more efficiently/safely than the microwave.  The only problem I've found is that the heating instructions included with the warmer are overestimated. If you set it to a lower temperature (between 1 and 2) and let it warm longer, it's easier to prevent overheating.This warmer DOES HAVE an ON/OFF SWITCH, but still no built-in timer (the oven timer works just fine).And as far as the bottle floating around during heating, you can put the bottle in BEFORE you add the water, and fill up the water to the same level as the liquid in the bottle to prevent uneven bobbing.My son is now 1-year-old and no longer uses bottles, but I still use this warmer for his refrigerated baby food and even to warm up a cup of milk for him."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "My mom got me this for a present because it used to be that you had to heat your bottles for formula.  Now you can feed the infants room temp, warmed, or cold.  I make the bottles as I feed so I feed room temp. and actually, this is what my baby likes most.  Sometimes I buy the ready to feed and store the bottles in the fridge so I warm them, but honestly, it takes a lot longer to do that than to just make the bottles.I think that this warmer actually takes longer to warm the bottles than to just put the bottle under hot water.  Just my opinion."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I think the [...]. The fill line is crucial in getting the bottle warm. If you fill the water to high than it doesn't heat as well. The water is supposed to be just at the level of milk in order for it to heat correctly. If you fill it correctly it will work. It works fast too. A bottle of cold breast milk from the fridge is warm in about 4 minutes. If you're warming room temperature formula it will be even faster, probably about 2 minutes. I highly recommend this bottle warmer. My baby is not on solids so I can't say how it works on baby food."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I've had this warmer for 3.5 years, and have used it for both of my boys. It still works, after 3.5 years, as well as it did when I bought it. The only thing I don't like is that you have to add water almost everytime you use it, and that it doesn't have automatic shut-off. I have burnt much milk and formula in my life! (When you're chasing two kids, it's easy to forget you're cooking a bottle!) And, there have been times, too, that I've forgotten to unplug it for hours at a time... my fault, I know, but another reason auto-shut-off would be great."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I first purchased another bottle warmer which I promptly returned because it did not work.  I received this bottle warmer as a gift from a friend who has three children, two of which are twins.  So, I figured she knew what was good and what was not.  And she was right, this works well.  I read some of the other reviews of this product but can only say I've had no problems with this.  It's easy to use and always warms the bottle just right...not too hot, not too cold.  I'm very pleased with this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I got this product as a combo with the Avent Sterilizer.  ((Side note: the Sterilizer is a MUST HAVE item!!))It's nice to have a place to warm the bottle, and it does cut down on wasting water (vs the other method of a bowl of warm water).  The biggest plus is it's faster to prepare.  The problem that I had with the bowl of water method is that I would over heat the water then have to do a cool down process.  I thought this product would help with that but it doesn't.  You can get the water to almost boiling.  You have to time it, but again, it's fast and ready to go in 6-7 minutes."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I used this for a short time. It was more of a pain for us.I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there. A timer would have been nice (and cheap enough to add).I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it.Yes, it may be the best there is out there, but that doesn't mean too much. It still has many flaws.Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on. There is so much they could have done with this that they didn't. Oh well."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have a dishwasher and had a full term very healthy child, and still used this product. Lids and nipples tend to turn up in the dishwasher and retain water, and sediment..so what is point if I have to just rewash them?This sterilizer holds 6 bottles, nipples, tops, and pacifiers all at the same time. You can put breast pump parts in it, and anything else that you need to sterilize. I washed everything, filled this with the items and water, and popped it in at 6 minutes in our microwave to have perfectly clean and sterilized bottles, pacifiers, or breast pump parts. I used this everyday until my son was 6 months old, when we stopped sterilizing bottles. Its easy, safe, convenient, and fast."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Despite the concerns about BPA we are using these bottles for our daughter, and using canned formula to supplement breastfeeding. The concern with BPA seems to be heightened when the bottles are washed with hot water, or sterilized at hot temperatures. We bought this sterilizer, but have stopped using it. However, we still use the dishwasher, which is fairly hot. I am keeping an eye on Avent's statements:[...]We keep using them because they seem to be really excellent bottles and nipples, she feeds easily and doesn't get a whole lot of gas. The nipples are designed so that you can graduate her to faster flow nipples as she gets bigger. We are hoping that the BPA concerns will turn out to be unwarranted."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I ama clean freak and ws parnoid from day one about germs and my first child. I live in an area with hard water and boiling things was not reassuring because the water left deposits on our nonstick cookware. I would wash her bottles and things , pop them in here and in the time it took me to finish cleaning the kitchen or toss some clothes in the dryer this would be done. I could leave the bottles in there or take them out and prepare for use while sterilizing pacifiers and other items. I use the Avent system and love this!Now that she is about 7 months I only sterilize once a week but this s so simple I do not regret my choice. Being a nurse I worried about my daughter catching something....this was just reassuring.Great as a gift...."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I am one of those without a dishwasher, unfortunately.  I use this sterilizer a few times a day for my baby's bottles and parts.  I don't use Avent bottles - works fine with other bottles.  I have to agree about making sure it's shut/snapped properly.  You have to make sure it's just right before you snap -- otherwise, you will break a nail or two.  Also exercise caution when taking it out of the microwave.  I always use an oven mitt to take it out and when opening the lid to avoid steam burns."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "It doesn't get any easier than this product.  Boy, am I glad that I got this at my shower.  I have never used anything more in my entire life than I have this guy.  It sterilizes my Avent breast pump as well.  As an aside, don't just rely on your dishwasher to sterilize your bottles and your breast pump.  For some reason, I never felt comfortable anyway just depending on it and put the bottles from the dishwasher into this sterilizer.  Well, I found out later that it was a great thing I was doing that because our dishwasher was not heating the water the way it was supposed to and nothing had been sterilized!  You can't always depend on one thing to do the job and since it's your baby's health involved here, take the extra step and make sure with this item.  I'm glad I did!  Plus, it's just so very easy to use."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This sterilizer is absolutely wonderful, especially if you take your baby on the road, i.e. to the grandparents' house.  If they've got a microwave, then you're ready to go.It's also very durable.  Ours gets lots of use every day and yet looks like it just came out of the box brand new.  Plus, unlike a bottle warmer appliance, there are no moving part or electrical components to wear out or break, so we expect we'll be using ours for years/babies to come."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "The express steam sterilizer is really the easiest and most efficient way to go if you want to be assured that your baby's bottles are truly clean.  When I first started using bottles I would use the sterilizer between dishwasher uses.  But after repeated cleanings in the dishwasher, the ounce markings on the bottles started to fade away, and the plastic caps to cover the nipples started to change color.  From then on I've used the sterilizer exclusively. It is quick, easy and effective.  I have taken several extended trips with the baby, and it is so easy to travel with and store her clean bottles in. This is one of those products that may not be necessary to have, but I am so glad that I do!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this.  This is the most wonderful item I have gotten.  I clean the bottles and then load them into this.  4 to 5 minutes later, the bottles are all sterilized.  I love this.  Since I express milk and freeze it, it is reassuring knowing that the storage containers are sterile.  I also love it because you never know if you are washing the bottles and pacifiers and such with warm enough water (I am a first time mom).  With the sterilizers I just have that reassurance that everything is clean enough for my baby.  This is well worth the money.  It is so easy to use and comes with extra bottles."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I highly recommend this product whether you are breast or bottle feeding (or sippie cup for that matter). I did not originally register for this item because I didn't think it was necessary, especially since we have a dishwasher. This is a great tool to get all those baby/toddler items germ free. I mainly use mine for sterilizing my breast pump supplies, bottles, and pacifiers. 4 minutes in the microwave and its done. Its not necessary to sterilize all baby products but when something really needs to be, it sure beats having to run the dishwasher. There are just the 3 of us so we only need to run the dishwasher about twice a week. I find that I sterilize more often just because it is so easy to use this product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "Yet another great product from Avent!  This is so very easy to use and in minutes you have sterilized bottles, pacifiers, toys, pretty much anything that you can fit into the the thing.  We have a dishwasher, but our doctor advised that newborns can be sensitive to the soap the first few months.  Plus with animals in the house, we just like the idea of a little extra peace of mind.  By the way, we started with the electric sterilizer but after reading the directions and seeing it's size we returned it for this one.  This one is easier to store and use and is faster."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I bought this one as well as the full size counter version. This one was really helpful with pacifiers and nipples. I had a harder time with bottles just cause not many fit in it. But I found that bottles in the dishwasher and nipples and pacis in the microwave steamer were much better. In the dishwasher the nipples sometimes come out with the white dish det. film on it, of course in the sterilizer..not..BUT please don't worry about being burned. Common sense tells you what to touch or not touch and honestly if you do it once...you won't do it again.. Overall better for the money then the bigger one from Avent."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "This product is easy to use, works well and is FAST . . . and everyone knows that time is precious is a new baby.  I use Advent bottles & pacifiers and they fit perfect as do all the parts to my Medela breast pump.  I don't use the sterilizer every time anymore since my daughter is a little older now.  I run the bottles & pacifiers though the dishwasher so I feel comfortable with the heat they get from that.  This sterilizer is great though as it is very light weight and easy to store in between uses.  It's up to you & your doctor whether you need a sterilizer, but if you do decide to get one, definitely get this one."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "On more than one occassion I've had a crying hungry baby on my hands in teh middle of the night or the very early morning, and walked into the kitchen only to find that all of the bottles are in teh sink or in the dishwasher yet to be run.  It's much easier to keep my daughter distracted four the 4 or 5 minutes I need to wash and sterelize in this product than to wait for a load of dishes to run!  If this sounds like somthing that could happen to you . . . buy this product! (Or put it on your registry)."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I love this sterilizer and AVENT products in a whole! I bought a sterilizer because I don't use the dishwasher at all, and well I just didn't trust it to 'sterilize' my baby's bottles well (especially the nipples!).  Well I must say that I'm very happy that I got this product.  It is VERY easy to store and does the job well. Avent bottles fit perfectly in it (as I'm sure you already guessed), but it also fits all other bottles!  I use it to sterilize my bottles, nipples, caps, pacifiers, teethers and breast pump parts.  I generally sterilize the bottles once a week, but if needed, I can take it out and sterilize her teethers, etc anytime."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "For weeks I boiled my ISIS pump parts and bottles, leaving on my non-stick pot calcium stain. As I was going back to work and my baby had to be bottle fed (thus more things to be sterilized), I found this great product and eagerly bought it. It's such a great invention! Everything (pump parts, nipples, dome caps, bottles etc) has slot of its own on the rack so they won't shift around. And if you keep the lid closed after sterilizing, contents stay sterilized for a day!Be sure to check your microwave power though, since it takes 4 minutes for a 1100watts microwave, longer for less powerful ones. Even though I have a 1350watts one, I do it for 4 minutes just to be sure!  And let it cool for recommended length of time to avoid scorching yourself.Enjoy this product and you won't regret."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have used the Avent \"II\" sterilizer found at other retailers.  (probably not much difference between the two)  I have been using the sterilizer for one month since having my twins.  It has really been helpful cleaning non-Avent items (breast pump items, baby bottles, pacifiers, etc.)  It can sterilize in 2 minutes (depending on the power of your microwave).  You don't HAVE to have this sterilizer, but, it helps if you want to clean a few items without having to boil water each time or running your dishwasher.It came with two small Avent bottles.  I'm not reviewing the bottles themselves - that's another topic.  However, this is a nice feature so you can try these bottles out to determine if you want to use their bottles or not."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We received the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot for ease of access to diapers. It attaches perfectly to the Gulliver Changing Table we have from IKEA which made me really happy. Accessing newborn diapers is a bit difficult since the diapers are much smaller than those used for older babies but that's fine since we won't be using newborn diapers for long. I'm curious to see how it will work with the cloth diaper inserts since we're planning on cloth diapering when our baby is out of the newborn stage. We haven't received our cloth diapers so I have yet to see. I'll post an update when I get them.I do wish it had a little larger storage for diapering supplies. With the wipers warmer in the caddy, it's difficult to see the supplies on the back side and I can only hold a pump bottle of hand sanitizer or a couple of tubes of diaper cream. Other than that, it's a handy product."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I have recently started having a problem with my 12 month old kicking everything off of the end of his changing table while I am changing his diaper. His changing table is a dresser than came with a wooden surround that is removable once you are out of the diaper changing stage. This easily slid onto the rail and remedied the problem we had with him kicking the diaper changing supplies to the floor.I like that the little side compartments are removable. DIsposable diapers are so thin now that the slot you pull the diapers out through could be a bit thinner. I do often have two diapers come out instead of one. Even with that issue, this product is well worth the eleven bucks I paid for it."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I was worried this wouldn't work for us. We have a Pottery Barn Kids changing table that has a decorative moulding that sticks out about 3/4 inch beyond the frame of the changer top. This product hangs at a slight angle because of this, but it still hooks on solidly to the changer's top edge, and gives us much needed storage space for wipes up top. It is an inexpensive fix to a very annoying problem. Another bonus is that the plastic piece that the wipes container rests on is hinged to allow easy access below for loading diapers or whatever you choose to store in there."}
{"label": 3, "raw": "We have had this product for 2 years now and it works great! We hang it off the side of the changing table and it keeps everything handy. The plastic is thick and it is very well constructed. The only issue we have with it was keeping the box of wipes from moving about in the space for the wipes. We just use the plastic flip top box the wipes come in and it isn't a wipe warmer so it is smaller. We couldn't take a wipe out of the dispenser using one hand without either lifting the lid off the box or lifting the enitre box. To solve the problem, we just bought industrial strengh velcro and attached it to the bottom of the box and the \"lid\" of the diaper depot. Great product after this minor adjustment!"}
{"label": 3, "raw": "I purchased this for use on our play yard where our son slept when he first came home. When I received it the size was appropriate, and I was able to attach it to the side of our play yard. However, I was very disappointed in the quality. The plastic it was constructed of was thinner than I hoped and that made the unit somewhat flimsy in my opinion and certainly not as sturdy as I had hoped. When I filled it with supplies, it looked as if it might break. I ended up returning it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic, it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses, I guess it's meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I'm giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the  product itself  is wonderful, it's not cakey, gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections, therefore I highly recommend it :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have mixed feelings about this product. When I first started using it, I can see and feel the difference. It actually started to literally peel the dark skin away. There's a bit of a sting but that's how I know it was working. My skin was lighter in just a couple weeks! However, once I've stopped using it when I reached my desired skin color, it went back to being dark. I applied more and suddenly it was no longer working. It didn't peel or sting. I wonder what went wrong or if it has an expiration date or something. Overall, it works but definitely not consistent."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I haven't been a big fan of Prada's fragrances over the years but absolutely fell in love with the sweetness and candy-like scent of this perfume! This smells like a sweet, decadent caramel with tones of vanilla and I'm not sure what else, but it smells great! Although, I must say that this seller is asking for WAY too high a price for this bottle! You could get the 2.7 oz bottle for around the same price at Neiman Marcus (the 1.7 oz for around $80 if you prefer a smaller bottle)!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm very picky when it comes to fragrance. I love to wear it, but I don't want to leave it on others after a handshake or a hug. My fragrance needs to be subtle.I sample a lot of fragrance until I settle on one that I really love and right now, BRIGHT CRYSTAL is what I put on each morning.BRIGHT CRYSTAL is like standing in a flower garden on a warm spring day and having a slight breeze blow just a hint of the garden's aroma in your direction.I put on a few drops in the morning and BRIGHT CRYSTAL is with me all day.I can't fully describe a fragrance without including a very important aspect of the product--the bottle. BRIGHT CRYSTAL is a pink liquid that comes in a rectangular clear bottle with an oversized oval-cut &#8220;crystal&#8221; stopper. It looks nice on the counter.If you enjoy a light floral scent, I definitely recommend BRIGHT CRYSTAL by Versace."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the real Versace Bright Crystal fragrance.  My bottle was not open, tampered with, or have a strong alcohol smell. I love how clean this perfume smells. I tried it out at Macy's. I wanted to try a fendi  scent, but the salesman asked me to try Bright Crystal and another Versace scent. I smelled the other first and then Bright Crystal. I was instantly sold on the Bright Crystal. I sprayed it on myself and then came straight to amazon to get it at a fraction of the price. The bottle is huge! I'll be wearing this everyday to the office, I'm sure I'll receive tons of compliments. Because the scent is not overpowering and very clean, I don't have to worry about it being too loud in an office setting. Thanks amazon!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "So i have been using the Avalon Organics both Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now. I have seen a pretty good result. My hair has definitely gotten a bit thicker and stronger. I notice less hair falling out. I have combined this shampoo/conditioner with also taking Biotin Supplements so i do not know if its solely because of the shampoo/conditioner or a combination between the both, but improvement is there. My only one complain is that the conditioner doesnt give you that soft conditioner feel other conditioners give you.. Its a little rough as oppose to soft. In conclusion, if you have thin hair i recommend both products as well to supplement with a daily Biotin vitamin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Bought this because my shower was getting cluttered with different kind of soap, shampoo, face wash and etc. After receiving this and putting it up on my shower wall, no more bottles!Pros:Each bottle holds a lot of liquid.Each to use buttons.Clean design.Comes with waterproof adhesive and it's stick as hell.Durable - I've dropped the bottles over and over again when I was clumsily trying to shampoo inside and it still works.Cons:The adhesive stinks when you first place it on but that's a given and does not take away rating for this product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have this in our guest bathroom shower and it is perfect.  The bottles hold only about 2/3 of the full size one I have in our master bath, but that is fine since the occasional use it gets doesn't facilitate a lot of refilling.  I loath those wire shelving units for showers so I was so excited to find this and have everything off the floor and kept together for easy use in such a tidy little package.This comes with the silicone adhesive AND a few squares of adhesive foam backing, the idea is you spread the silicone on and the adhesive foam squares hold it in place while it dries.  You have to wait 24 hours before filling the bottles to allow the silicone glue to cure. I have one of these in my master bath for 3 years without budging so it is a very strong hold."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I first purchased this hand treatment from a garden center - what a favorite it has become. I really does help restore your hands after digging in the garden (or washing dishes in the sink, if you're old-fashioned like me). I have purchased many as gifts for others. This size (100g) is a generous tube and will last a long time. I gave it four stars only because it is more expensive here than at the Crabtree & Evelyn outlet store - or maybe I just got lucky when I visited that store last time. Truth is, I'll buy it wherever I can find it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Crabtree & Evelyn Gardener's Hand Therapy has been my favorite lotion for many years.  While I don't have a problem with very dry skin, I still like a good, non-greasy lotion for my hands, arms, feet, and sometimes even my face.  This product is not greasy.  It does not have an annoying fragrance, actually not much at all.  My sister-in-law told me she uses it on her psoriasis and it helps.  It's not a cure, of course.  There really isn't one.  But it helps the skin feel better.  Since she liked it so much, I tried it and have been using it ever since.  It's hard to find in stores---almost impossible---but Amazon.com carries it.  Thanks again, Amazon."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't curl my hair every day so I didn't need to get a high-end curler.  I dropped my old curling iron (10+ years old) and had to buy one from an all-night pharmacy.  I paid twice as much as the Amazon price but was very happy with the curling iron.  What a surprise to save 50% thru Amazon for the exact same product.  Now I have one tucked into my overnight bag for visits to the grandkids.The iron does everything I need it to do.  Heats quickly, evenly, and has an automatic turn-off.  The barrel is the perfect width (you'd be surprised how much this can vary.)  It feels great in my hand without being cumbersome."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I like the size of the barrel on this iron and I like the results I got with it.  However the design of the kickstand and its location are horrible and unsafe.When you heat the iron up on the higher settings the kickstand gets very, very hot and it's very difficult to use the iron without touching that kickstand because of where it's located.  I burned my hand on it while holding the iron and then I burned my face with the kickstand while curing my hair.I'm not at all happy with this product and I'm returning it after using it only twice."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "So in love with my conair curling iron. I have been using this everyday since I bought this. I have never had a curling iron with a clip, so I was wanting to try it. It heats up quick. I think the buttons are perfect, I have not hit them once while using the tool. Curling iron came in super fast, came in2 days before shipment date! It did take me some practice to use this. After the third time, I finally got use to it. Overall this product is fabulous. I recommend this if you want a curling iron easy to use, something that heats up quick, shipment comes in super quick, and for a great deal!P.S If you are interested in this product, but unsure how to use it; go on youTube and look up &#34;How to curl hair with conair curling iron&#34;.

It gets hot pretty quickly and doesn't take long to curl my hair. I like it, and I believe it's good buy. I read some comment said it doesn't last &#34;too&#34; long or something but I don't really mind. For the price, just can't beat it or at least give it a try!!!"}

It gets extremely hot -- settings range from 1 to 25 and even a \"5\" is too hot to touch; I've used it at \"13\" for several months now with great results. Its clamp holds hair securely but doesn't snag hairs in the hinge. A sturdy wire foot and a plastic tip keep the hot barrel off the countertop. It has an on/off button and will automatically turn itself off (but not until it's left untouched for about an hour). The iron cools in the usual amount of time (touchable in 5-10 minutes, completely cool in 15+ minutes).I mostly use the 3/4-inch model -- but, with my very short hair, I also use the1/2-inch modelduring the first week or so after I've had a haircut. Highly recommended -- they're the best curling irons I've ever used."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My hair is super straight and thin. It also doesn't take heat very well. What's so great about this curler is the adjustable heat settings. 7 works great for me and I just hold it there for ten seconds. Not only that but the curls actually stay. Most times, they go wavy after the first 30 minutes, no matter how long I hold it on for. But with this it lasted me two hours. I'm so impressed and especially for the price. You cannot beat that."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I absolutely love this conair instant heat curling iron!  I ordered it on amazon because of the great price. It did not come in the packaging I'm used to seeing in stores but figured it may have just changed since my last curling iron purchase (last year).  The first time I used it it worked great.  The second it kept turning off or shorting out on me.  I changed outlets and still the problem continued.I would recommend this curling iron to a friend but perhaps not through the internet.I re-ordered thinking it was just a defective one and the second time, it wouldn't even heat up enough to hold a curl.  I think Conair has changed it's product and I will not buy again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I asked my husband to go out and get me a curling iron with a fat barrel and this is what he got me. It has a large barrel, it heats up extremely quickly, and it has automatic shut-off. Those are some definite pluses, but there are a few things that bother me. The barrel is short compared to my other curling irons. The stand gets in the way, though I can fold it back; and the the way the handle is designed, it's not comfortable to hold. I accidentally change the heat settings just trying to curl my bangs.It works, but all the little details make this my least desirable curling iron of all time."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I needed a 1/2 inch curling iron and this one works just fine for my needs.  I have one of the same model in the one inch and I liked it, so ordered the same model in the smaller size.  I like that it turns itself off after a certain period of time because I often forget to do so.  I also like that you can adjust the heat or strength of curl.  I have had many Conair products over the years and have been satisfied with all of them."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I wanted to be blown away by this concealer, but sadly I wasn't; don't get me wrong this concealer is good, I gave it 3 stars because first and foremost it's real sticky creamy consistency, after I applied it, it kept this wet sticky texture, I like the ones that don't stay wet like and sticky, plus it made me have a few pimples,  if your looking for a concealer that stays kinda damp then you will love this one, because all of us girls like different things, and one thing may work perfect for one of us may not work at all for someone else, ya know!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have had one tube of this for a couple of years now and JUST ran out. I am feeling very yucky without it.I only gave it 4 stars because the consistency could be a SMIDGE more creamy, but it has decent staying power.For those who say that it doesn't cover the dark circles under the eyes, you will need to 1st use a concealer that is a shade lighter than your face's skin color first (or closer to a salmon color) and then lightly add this to the top. Watch some videos on YouTube about 'highlighting' and you will find that this color is perfect for those highlighting areas on top of your base/ foundation and normal concealer.Maybe there are better versions of this in the 'fancier' brands, but I am returning to buy this one because I know it works and takes off 10 years when used under my eyes."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm no expert at beauty, so this is just one regular user's experience. However, I put it on and it stayed green, which had me worried. I blended it, and could see the blemish (red) peeking through, while the green remained stubbornly green. Given that it's a stick of concealer, it's a little insulting to think I did it wrong. Nevertheless, I removed it and tried again. Same result.So I went ahead and did my usual powder foundation/settling veil powder routine, and lo and behold - I could still see the blemish AND the green through my makeup.I'm not really sure what's going on. Perhaps I'm using the wrong color concealer? Either way, it really didn't behave or perform the way I expected or hoped it would. Good thing it was cheap because it has been sitting, unused in a drawer since day 1."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It does remove most of my eye makeup but not all. When I use it, it seems to remove it all but then I wash my face and see black mascara rings under my eyes. I'm using as directed, so I feel  it's not that effective. Also, it is moisturizing but too 'oily' for me. I find myself wiping my eyes on my face towel but still feel a residue around my eyes. I think it's all right but I wouldn't purchase again. Almay's makeup remover pads did a much better  job but they were somewhat drying ... so I'm still on the lookout for an ideal mascara remover"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I read Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover and thought &#34;Hey, I can finally used something other than baby oil, or other house-hold oils,&#34; thinking that it wasn't an oil bases remover. When it arrived I find out that this product is essentially just unscented mineral oil. It works and I'll use it until it's gone but I'll go back to using coconut oil when it's gone. If, like me, your use an unscented oil for moisturizing (I use coconut oil) then make it work double duty as a makeup remover as well and save a couple bucks and cut down on counter/makeup drawer clutter."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This was the first waterproof liquid eyeliner that I used. When I first started using it, I loved it. However, I had nothing to compare it to. Since, I've used different drug store brands of liquid eyeliner and this one sort of fails in comparison. Don't get me wrong, it isn't horrible, but there are others out there that are better. It is waterproof, but it isn't air proof. It dries, cracks an then flakes off throughout the day. As it dries, it feels as if it tightens and shrinks (which causes the cracking). While it does this, IT ITCHES SOMETHING FIERCE! After a while, the brush starts to get weird and application gets messy. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "As long as this eyeliner is applied correctly there should be no peeling, fading or flaking.  The only time I get some flaking or peeling is if I apply it too thickly. I put this on early in the morning (7am or so) and don't take it off until 11 or 12 pm.  And in all that time it stayed where I put it and the color stayed true.I have horrible allergies and I also have tear producing issues...combine these problems and there is really nothing I could wear to line my eyes-until I found  Maybelline Lineworks.  My eyes can and will at times ooze tears all day.Sometimes it looks as if I'm having a crying jag. BUT even through all this, my liner never goes anywhere! I use Ponds to take it off at night.  Easy peasy!The only thing I'm upset with is that Maybelline seems to be  dis-continuing many of the colors and while I can understand it, I don't LIKE it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Simply put, there is nothing on this earth that removes rough skin for my feet.  My skin is baby smooth after use.  This product is rather messy; therefore I would suggest using the product outside.  Otherwise you are left with white skin bits on your floors that are rather unappealing and difficult to clean.  You will be astonished by how much new skin is revealed after using this product.  I also use it on my hands, knees and elbows.  My skin is highly sensitive and there are no adverse reactions to this product. I've been using this for over 10 years and wouldn't use anything else."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This may work on dandruff but does not work on seborrhoeic dermatitis. They are different. Dandruff is a generic term and coal-tar active ingredient products like this one may work on the kind of dandruff that flakes.If you have an itchy scalp which does not shed but instead causes sores, you may have the already mentioned seborrhoeic dermatitis. The latter is caused by clogged oil glands. It often takes place if you don't shampoo frequently. That was the case with me. I shampooed only once a week because I did not want to ruin my expensive hair-color. The problem took several years to really develop before my doctor and I finally figured out what was wrong. What you need instead is a shampoo like the kind of Selsun Blue which contains selenium hydride."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "As a young woman who has lost a lot of hair due to thyroid problems, I have tried a few products with mixed success.  This product isn't even marketed towards hair loss but I gave it a try...and it actually works!  I started with the extra strength shampoo but switched to regular (less stinky, still effective).  My hair loss stopped completely and even started growing back!  The shampoo does smell awful, but it works!  I just rinse really well and use a lot of shampoo.  It leaves my hair soft, clean, and shiny.  I will definitely keep using this product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was looking for something to aleive my scalp build up so that my hair will grow out again.  I tried Nioxin, and all it did was burn my scalp and make my hair feel dry and brittle.  I had tried T/Sal a long time ago without any adverse effects.  I went back to it, and I'm STILL in love with it!  No burning, itching, or other adverse effects.  (It doesn't strip my hair either!)My scalp is actually sun burnt right now and it didn't even agitate the burn when I applied it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "During the past two years I've been struggling with some scalp build up problems and I pretty much have purchased all the drugstore products I could find to solve this. After months and months of trying to find a solution I decided to give this a try even though I thought it was quite expensive and yes, it did start to get better right away. However, it wasn't as quick of a process as I wanted it to be so I decided to buy Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength and use it combined with this and this combination REALLY solved it in a matter of days. Since I've done that I haven't had any problems, my scalp is super clear and I couldn't be any more please. I never really stopped using this product and I don't plan on doing it but just keep in mind that this product by itself didn't really do too much. In terms of the smell I don't really like it, but it's nothing intolerable or disgusting."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very dry super curly hair. I get build up on my scalp whenever i use 'regular' shampoo/conditioner. I've been using apple cider vinegar to treat this but it doesn't always work for me.  After the FIRST use, this shampoo cleared up my scalp. It's squeaky clean with no weird off-white build up! Yay!There's also no smell! I've tried head and shoulders, tar shampoo and hated the smell.This stuff is fragrance free. I love it :)Btw, haven't tried the conditioner but I use my ACV/Water spray as a conditioner after this shampoo. Works wonders, super soft curly hair with clean scalp :)"}

My stylist told me about this product but I didn't want to buy it from her because the product was marked up so much, so I went in search of it a year or two later. I found it at a local store more expensive than online, so I purchased it here.Wow o wow is my hair happy. My hair has a shine that wasn't there before, my hair seems stronger with the weekly use of the VO5 hot oil treatment and I'm having less issues with our humidity creating flyaways. My hair is noticeably softer to the touch, and easier to manage when I straighten. I'm no longer having to use the flat iron as long.Love love love this product. Buy it once, and I promise you'll want to keep buying."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have natural tightly coiled African hair and have tried other hot oils included pure olive oil but wasn't satisfied with the result. I heard about using VO5 from natural hair forums and thought I'd give it a try. While using it in the shower I wasn't particularly impressed, but once my hair dried, I must say I was happy with the result. My very very tight coils were actually loosened quite a bit and hung down to my shoulder....with a lot of bounce. I will defiantly be using this product again."}

This is the 3 ounce travel bottle that you can sometimes find in you local drug store for about $2.50, NOT $5.62!!!  For $5.48 - $5.85 you can buy the 7 ounce bottle at every drugstore in your town or on line at CVS.com or Drugstore.com or any other online national drug store chain.  DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THIS SELLER!!  YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU GET! THE PRICE SHOULD BE FOR THE 7 OUNCE BOTTLE AND NOT THE 3 OUNCE BOTTLE.  RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I know a lot of persons have commented on how great these Buf-puf sponges are, but I had to add my own praise.  I had previously tried the regular and found that they were a bit too harsh for my skin (I have both eczema and acne, so my face tended to get extremely sensitive even when I was gentle with the puff).  The gentle is perfect and  I'm happy I bought the 6-pack too.We're currently renovating at home and it feels so nice after dusting, sweeping and mopping every evening to be able to just put a little Cetaphil cleanser on it and just buff off all the dirt....no other scrub product required...I also use the body buf-puf for showering and can't help but feel nice and clean afterwards.A great little product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is another product I've used for years to keep my face clean. I'm almost 70 and people say I look 20 years younger so keeping the facial skin free of oil and dirt must have some merit. Buf-Puf are a bit hard to find but luckily we have Amazon. Gave one to my granddaughter to help her avoid Acne and show her how to avoid oil and bacteria caused pimples. Buf-Puf Gentle has a little scrubbing action which helps to remove dead skin and keep the skin glowing. Recommended highly for daily use."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had this item in my wish list forever and I'm so glad I finally bought it.I use the buff puff with a good facial cleaner in the shower and wow - it exfoliates more effectively that anything else I've tried, and I've tried it all. I really feel like my serums and moisturizers are able to penetrate after using the buff puff instead of sitting on top of my skin. For the first few uses, I suggest using a very light hand, as it can be a little harsh."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I really like that this stuff is mild and gentle, but also totally cleans off any makeup that I'm wearing, even waterproof mascara. I love the scent, very fresh and clean, and the texture is nice too. It washes off very easily and doesn't cause any problems to my skin. I have a problem with acne, and haven't noticed any improvement on it because of this product, but it definitely doesn't make it worse and really makes me feel fresh after I've used it.This is now my favorite nighttime cleanser because it's gentle, yet does an amazing job of getting my face clean and makeup-free at the end of the day. I love it for that reason, and will keep using it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "As the title says, it broke me out really bad. I finally had figured out what worked for my skin and had a semi clear face with a pimple or two here and there (that time of the month, stress) but I needed just a bit more of moisture so I decided to try this moisturizer--BIG mistake. I usually brake out on my chin/jaw and in between my eyebrows/forehead so when I woke up the next day I had so many little white in those exact spots. I cannot tell you how upset I was and how itchy my face was. I hate this product and would not recommend this to somebody who has acne-prone, sensitive, oily skin.I only gave it a star because I could not give it zero stars!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this product after in was recommend as a disinfectant in the book Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me. I had been becoming extremely frustrated with my oily skin and frequent breakouts, so I was ready to try something new. For the past 1 1/2 months, I have been religiously using this product in the morning and Clear Pore Nighttime Clarifying Gel (a BHA product) prior to bed. While I haven't seen miraculous results, I have had a reduction in breakouts, and my skin texture seems to be slowly improving. In addition, I am no longer getting the dry, flaky patches which I was getting with other products. However, my skin is still oily, and I do still experience the occasional breakout. While this product certainly might provide you with some benefits over time, keep in mind that you will not see immediate results:  despite the claims, there is NO product available which can get rid of existing blemishes."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I can't believe that I find an acne cream that actually works!! I don't even remember how many creams, lotions etc.  I tried over the years until now for adult acne. This is the first time I really see some result and I even don't use it regularly. If you put it on at night you'll see the effect the next morning. Even if the blemishes don't completely go away the next day, they reduce down in size. It helps with the redness and the pain. I have a very sensitive skin and this doesn't dry out my skin. The only minor issue is that I don't think it is completely vanishing. Some white residue still stays but it is manageable. Overall very gentle yet powerful cream. Definitely recommended."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I recently started breaking out on my cheeks and jawline which was never a problem area when I was in my teens. This works if you use it just like the directions say: on clean skin, once a day initially then increase to several times daily. On day two I use it like every 2 hours.It makes the pimple or, in my case, underground monster, less visible and less irritating. It gets rid of any pain or soreness that makes me want to pick and pop. After day two it completely disappears.Honestly, the best thing about this product is that it makes me keep my hands OFF my face which is likely why I break out in the first place. Oh, and I started changing my pillow case every night."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My skin is pretty resilient and not easily irritated, with that being said I started with one a day but quickly moved up to two. I use this between my CeraVe foaming cleanser and my CeraVe moisturizer and they've been working very well so far. They are pretty cheap and this order came with three boxes, but if you want the most bang for your buck you can cut these pads in half. I generally don't use the entire pad so half is perfect and now you have 540 uses for ~$11."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Cetaphil Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar is indeed the optimum choice for my problem skin.This pH balance non-soap cleansing bar is a super gentle all over body wash. I even use it on my face in lieu of shaving cream - it's that soothing!  The antibacterial ingredient - triclosan, also helps protect my freshly shaved face.CONS:This stuff's priceyCetaphil Antibacterial Cleansing Bar is very soft and it melts away quickly once it's under the shower stream.TIP: To reduce wastage of this pricey cleansing bar, don't lather up under the shower, lather up your washcloth instead and store your Cetaphil Cleansing Bar away from the shower (I keep mine in a covered soap dish).Shop around on Amazon ... this product offers a few buying choices.Hope my review was helpful ...

{"label": 4, "raw": "As someone who has battled acne in the past and still gets occasional breakouts, I learned over time that the beauty companies will keep coming out with their new facial cleaners that are supposed to do some new thing that all the other previous facial cleansers didn't do. The cleansers that were advertised as for acne always made my acne worse, especially if they had salicylic acid. This is a basic facial cleanser that does everything you need. Personally I don't want to wash my face every single day with a cleanser full of chemicals. The 6 ounce bar of this is a great value and lasts a long time. The only thing to be careful about with this bar is that it can be a little drying. Make sure you don't use too much, and I always use a moisturizer. I use once a day before bed."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Alpha Hydrox might as well close it's doors.  I don't know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price.  Now they cost twice what they did then, understandable with inflation, but don't work worth a darn.  Yet another epic fail.  I am so disappointed in this product line.  I purchased several different products a few months ago and after finishing the bottles am still convinced they are absolute garbage.  They do not do what they claim but if you just want a lotion...here you go.  They are just like any other plain old lotion."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I usually read ingredient lists carefully, but I guess the name fulled me and I thought this product had some AHA's.  After using it for a while and not seeing or feeling any difference (AHA's should sting a bit) I checked and sure enough, despite the name, no AHAs.  I wanted a product with AHAs and think the company's name is deceiving on such a product.  I thought they only sold products with AHAs.  Perhaps they aren't doing this intentionally, but it is confusing and I wanted to let everyone know in case you were fooled too."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this instead of the moisturizer by mistake, and thought I'd give it a try.It works better than most other cleansers I've tried for my more mature, slightly acne prone, sensitive skin. It's gentle, but effective and my skin feels really smooth and great after I use it. I've noticed that it seems to make the Alpha Hydrox Moisturizer more effective. Definitely a plus. The size of the container is ample, and I use about a quarter's worth for my whole face and decolletage, so it will go a long way."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I wanted a good face wash that doesn't sting my eyes and leave them bright red with irritation.  I read another reviewers comments that this face wash was non irritating to your eyes & decided to give it a try. It does the job and doesn't irritate my eyes unless I intentionally open them while I'm washing my face. Stupid, I know, but I kind of wanted to see if it would burn? So here's the report: not too much. It did burn but not nearly as much as some others I've tried AND it washed out instantly & didn't leave my eyes scarlet with irritation.My personal favorite face wash is by Philosophy - but that's a huge bottle and really pricey. This is a great size, doesn't take up too much real estate on my bathroom counter & does the job.  I'll definitely order again."}

I had bad acne from using the pill and was on ProActive.This cleanser worked just as well and it wasn't $40!My skin was so soft and seriously, after one day of use my skin cleared up.I'm so happy I found this again. They've stopped selling this at most drug stores.I have dry skin during the winter and super oily during the summer. This is great cleanser during the summer months.It's a bit drying on my skin during the winter so I use Aveda moisturizer after.Btw,If you love Aveda cleansing gel, you might like this."}

I did a search on Amazon and stumbled upon the Alpha Hydrox which had some good reviews so I decided to give it a try.I've been using it for about a week now, twice a day and I am actually seeing a reduction in the appearance of cellulite! I've been using on my hips/thighs/booty in conjunction with zone-specific exercises (which in the past by itself hasn't produced results like these). I was never overweight or large, so there was never a lot of cellulite, but enough to make me self-conscious in a swimsuit.I would say that the appearance of stretch marks is still the same, but for the price of the bottle this is definitely worth it for combating cellulite!"}

It has softend the depth of a lot of my wrinkles, and faded my darkest age spots.They're not gone completely, but definitely less noticeable. My skin tone is much more even. I use it morning and night. My skin is very sensitive and every other AHA lotion I've used has caused breakouts. I get none with this stuff. My skin is very dry however and after letting this absorb for 5-10 minutes, I use Cetaphil moisturizer... cream at night and the lighter Cetaphil lotion in the morning. Very happy with this product, which is 1/2 the price of drug store stuff and 1/4 the price of department store stuff with all it's fancy advertising."}

After, I applied this and when I woke up this morning, I noticed a change in my skin already.  *I have KP (Keratosis Pilaris) on my back and small areas of my thighs* Don't expect a miracle overnight, but expect to notice a change in the way your skin feels instantly.  You don't need to apply much of this product.  A small, less than a dime sized amount, is more than enough to work with.  On the box it says that if application does not dry within a minute or less, you've used too much.  It's true.  I think this is a steal for the price and the thickness of this product.  I look forward to more results after a week, two weeks, a month, etc. and will be back for a second review.  7/24/13"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If you want to live your life like a vampire...this is the right product for you! Why? Well, I found out the hard way, Glycolic Acid increases your skins sensitivity to the sun. A warning was issued on the lable, but silly me didn't think it would be that big of a deal. I burnt horribly the next day from 20 min. of sun exposure! YIKES! Not worth it.It does, however, improve the look of the skin, the price is great, and there is no fragrance(YAY). BUT, like most beauty products, it has dimethicone, which is an acne irritant. If you have horrible acne like me, dimethicone is TERRIBLE for you! Find something with out it! If you don't, than this might work nicely for you. Dimethicone is bad no matter what, but it wont hurt your skin appearance if you have no acne."}

It did exactly like it promised. My face looked much brighter and clear.  However on day 5, I woke up with red itchy pimples all over my face and neck.  After a series of expensive test and research, my derm said it was contact dermatitis from using this product. She said that it had the preservative Diazolidinyl Urea in it.  She went on say that a lot of companies are moving away from this preservative because it causes problems with a lot of people. Keep in mind, I do not have sensitive skin. That being said, if they would discontinue using DIAZOLIDINYL UREA in their product, I would definately try it again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "As a retired hairdresser I have some training in skin care and the Alpha Hydrox line is effective and modestly priced. It works better than the designer products at triple the price. Don't waste your time or money on any product with less than 8% glycolic acid, and don't be suckered into buying brands that promise more than 14%. The FDA mandates no more than 14%, and those products that claim higher concentrations are \"fudging\" their formulations. One thing to remember? When you try a new product give it 6 weeks of use before deciding whether or not it works for you. It takes 6 weeks for skin cells to go through their \"life\" cycle. It's only after a full cycle that you will see full and true results. I love this whole line of skin care and have been using it for several years. I just turned 50, and people are constantly asking what skin care products I use. You simply cannot beat the Alpha Hydrox line for effectivness and cost!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product seems to be making my fine lines fade. I only use it around my eyes and sometimes my forehead on the horizontal creases. I have used it almost nightly for about a month, and even though my sleeping has been less than desirable, my fine lines are definetly minimized. I am using this as a preventive measure (I am only 24 years old) so not sure how it would work on more mature skin. My one criticism is that it also seems to dry my face out slightly. This product is very potent with Alpha Hydroxy Acids(10%) which can cause irritation, photo-sensitivity and flaking. Research has shown that AHA can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but there is little evidence to suggest long-term efficacy."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't know what it is about AHA products but they all make me break out insanely. I thought maybe it was just the face wash so I tried the lotion because of all the amazing reviews but it was horrible. First, it doesn't blend well into the skin. Within two days of using it I have acne all over my face, blackheads and huge cysts. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has acne. There are waaayy better products, like Bliss No Zit Sherlock.Edit: I had 2 people say this review was \"unhelpful\" so maybe I should clarify. I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all, I've never had a rash or any type of allergic reaction to a face product before. Maybe this is an allergic reaction, there's a first time for everything! Personally, I just think this product is not good for people who have acne, but it could just be me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this to try because it seemed to have some good active ingredients at a fair price. Alas, as I already know, you get what you pay for. First, the smell is pretty off putting, but that's not the deal breaker for me. What I really dislike is the watery texture and how it seems to just sit on my skin in white streaks that don't seem to absorb so much as dry on the face. This just feels icky yo use before bed and it's definitely not right for under makeup. Once it finally dries, it does sort of tighten the skin, but leaves it feeling sort of tuggy, not soft and smooth.I am generously giving this 2 stars because at least it doesn't seem to cause any adverse reactions."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "So i was a bit skeptical about this product at first. I tried it for a whole week and let me tell you-brighten skin tone-acne going away-old acne scars fading-new acne scars fading-softnes-smoothnessI just dont really like the smell. I did a patch test as they said. It burns on acne marks alil but no harm just working.How I use it before I go to bed i apply a peas size that all. I even started using it for my toes knuckles they have gotten hard from last summer.. and its helping!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "so i've been using this product for around 5+ months. it stung a lot in the beginning and became a little better once I started using it regularly. the cream isn't very moisturizing and to me doesn't have a velvet-ey texture that some of my other moisturizers have.i guess it did seem to work but only after a few months. my skin's texture feels somewhat softer but i'm not sure if it's entirely because of this. in the past couple of months i've improved my diet and also incorporated gym trips.i recently switched my cleansers from the PINK loreal 360 to the apricot scrub also by Loreal 360 and since the scrub dries out my face, i used this and it STUNG SO MUCH. i don't have sensitive skin and i have normal/dry skini have a little product left but i am not repurchasing and i'm switching to st. ivers elastic collagen? cream."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was very skeptical about buying this because I have tried just about everything out there on my skin. I haven't had any noticable results until now. I use this with Alpha Hydrox facewash. My skin has never looked better! After the first week I noticed amazing results. I have oily acne prone skin, but the combination of the two products has made a huge difference in my life. My complection has never looked better. I finally feel comfortable going without my make up, which I haven't done that since I was 13, pathetic huh?  I reccommend this to EVERYONE! It's worth every penny! I started noticing fine lines in my forehead so I wanted to find a anti-wrinkle cream to help with all my skin issues,uneven skin tone, breakouts, oily skin, etc.After a 2 weeks of this wah la! PERFECTION!!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This lotion in okay, not greasy, not very moisturising either.I bought it after reading the benefits of including glycolic acid in my skin care regimen, it was intended for my face. I have not used it for that long on my face, as I use Tretinoin most evenings. When I did use it, it was somewhat sticky, stung a bit, and I did not notice much in terms of effect or benefit from it. I did not break out, but it did not help with the acne and other sundry bumps on my face.However, I had these small bumps, in the fold behind my knees. I read on Amazon that this lotion could help, and indeed it has, within about 5 days the area has been completely cleared of the bumps.I will continue to use it all over my body, and face, whenever I am taking a break from Tretinoin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts. The worst part are the red marks that hang around for weeks even after the blemish is gone. This product is not only keeping my skin clearer, thus avoiding more red marks, it's also fading the red marks that were already there. My face hasn't been this clear in a long, long time. I use it once in the morning and once at night. It goes on nice and light under makeup - I can't even tell it's there. I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm 48 and Mom is 75 yrs old and ANY moisturizer gives us immediate acne.  I'm glad I found this again, the AH souffle is a tad oily.  The no-oil formula is a godsend, no more breakouts.  The product exfoliates according to how much and how often you use it (overuse will get you a red face).  It provides a gentle peel effect that starts working quickly drying up oil and acne.  I like the rate of peel; no scaly face. In 2-3 months I had smoother skin, slightly smaller pores, and better skin tone.  Using Alpha Hydroxy I have received the first EVER complements on my skin. I have very few wrinkles for my age.  I'm not saying I look 30, but I look good.  Mom's a recent convert, her skin has smoothed and she has noticed a difference."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this product based on the rave reviews about using it as a treatment for acne. I currently have a strict regimen I stick to every morning and every night that is the only thing that works for me. I added the Alpha in and have seen no significant difference. It's on par with using 2% salicylic acid, which doesn't do much. I won't be repurchasing this as I don't feel it's worth the money.My products:Morning- 15% Benzoyl Peroxide face wash, 1% clindamycin lotion (prescription)Afternoon - 1% Clindamycin lotionNight - 10% Benzoyl peroxide creamI tried using this in the morning before applying my clindamycin lotion and then again in the afternoon after washing my make up off. It's better than using nothing but barely."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am using this in tandem (switching nights) with other products that provide chemical exfoliation for my horrible skin, so it is hard for me to speak about its effectiveness specifically. That said, I do know that I have had no problems with this product. I was concerned that it would irritate my skin, as I am certainly prone to irritation and redness,  but I have had no such issues at all. It seems to be the gentlest of the products that I use. My skin is looking (relatively) fantastic lately, and this probably has something to do with it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is heavier than the lotions so I normally use it on my arms and legs, and a dab on my face at night with the lotion. It's fragrance free, doesn't break me out and helps with winter itching. I recommend for sensitive skin types like mine, because cold weather makes my life miserable. Always has. Dry skin, rough hair and five months of no light. At least there's a lotion line out there that cures one of those issues. Could the makers of cetaphil please destroy winter as we know it? I'd really appreciate it, if this global warming deal doesn't work out...thanks. Oh by the way, I think they changed the formula because it's easier to spread."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I moved to the high desert plains a couple of years ago and the combination of low humidity and hard water began to wreak havoc on my skin. I've tried many different products at many price points, including some extremely expensive ones. Lotions did not last and most creams I tried felt too heavy or either looked *or* felt greasy. This Cetaphil formula has the perfect balance for me; it is light enough to sink in deeply and thick and creamy enough to make my skin feel incredibly soft and have that feeling last.TIP: I buy this extra large size to keep the cost low but I reuse small cream containers to make this \"portable\".Leaves my skin soft and supple. Doesn't leave a scent. Doesn't cause breakouts. Quite simply the best!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I buy this sat Costco when it is on sale and went on Amazon to do a comparison price check.  I do not use this as my everyday body cr&egrave;me, even though my dermatologist wishes I would.  This is non scented and I tend to use it at night after showering before I go to bed as it very rich.  I turned on a friend to this as she has very dry skin and now she uses it every day.  Important to note:  scoop a small amount onto your hands and rub your hands together to 'melt it down' before applying to the body."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't know why people use crap like this.It is full of chemicals that I would not put on my body because those chemicals you put ON your body go into your body.So what does one use instead?Well just about EVERY brand you can buy online or at the drugstore uses bad ingredients.So it's better to use natural stuff like:shea butterCoastal Scents Unrefined Shea Butter, 16 Ouncejojoba oilorganic coconut oilYou can easily mix this stuff together and make your own 100% natural and CHEAPER creams and oils for your face and body and not risk getting cancer from all those bad chemicals.Check out this info:beautyoffood.com/?hop=nfopowerUnfortunately the \"beauty industry\" will put any crap into a product if it will make your skin look or feel better but they don't give a dang about how it might affect your overall health.Don't be a chump, use your own cheaper better creams and oils - some stuff like cucumbers which you can rub on your face, are So cheap and work better than anything!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This stuff is a miracle. I have incredibly dry skin from eczema and allergies. Winter is pretty awful for me. My skin, especially my legs, get very dry and itchy. Then I scratch and they hurt. Then I put lotion on and they sting. And I've tried everything, having particular luck with colloidal oatmeal lotions, but they weren't perfect.But this has been a godsend.Even though I use Cetaphil face wash, I would have never thought to try this out but received it in a package of products from Allure called the Allure Beauty Box. After my first use I was in love.It's thick, feels nice going on, doesn't burn, and kept my skin unbelievably healthy. I haven't scratched my legs once all winter for the first time in 25 years. Seriously unbelievable.I can't recommend this enough. Really does what it says!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "On my doctor's advice I started using Cetaphil products. I absolutely love the moisturizing cream as it seems to really sink into the skin and moisturize it. I always apply this cream before going to sleep at night followed up by an application the following day. During particularly dry seasons, I may apply this cream several times a day.This stuff really works. I suffer from very dry skin and Atopic Dermatitis. Applying the Cetaphil cream seems to help alleviate these skin conditions. What is really nice is the skin cream is unscented. Sensitive skin, like mine, can be irritated by perfumed lotions.Highly reommend."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have extremely dry skin/psoriasis and I have tried all of the moisturizers in the world that claim to relieve dry skin but Cetaphil is the only cream that has ever saved me. It's really great for any skin type and I recommend it to everyone. It seems like it would be greasy but when its put on, it absorbs really fast and you can see that your skin really and FINALLY finally moisturized and its a rather wonderful feeling. I'm pretty sure that if I didn't use it, I'll have horribly dry/ peeling skin all over my face and look twenty years older than I actually do because of it. It's so wonderful! CeraVe and Cetaphil are the two moisturizers I highly recommend, but Cetaphil is still my favorite."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find.  I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn't cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.I'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads).The only downside is that it won't remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This 4 oz side is perfect to throw in your gym bag or overnight suitcase."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Hi,I've been using Cetaphil for years now.  I first bought after reading reviews in Allure magazine and I wasn't disappointed one bit!! It's the best, non drying and non-abrasive cleanser I've ever used... and while it is a bit pricey (I'm pretty cheap lol) it's worth it and the bottle (used by my eldest daughter and myself) lasts us 6 months!  And you can use it without water if you needed too!  It's amazing!Honestly, I will use this stuff forever.  :)LOVE it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have sensitive skin and combination at that. I used to spend much more money on the kinerase moisturizer. But I decided to try other brands so save some money. After several attempts on different brands. I found this gem! Diamond in the rough! It lasts me a long time and I have no reaction to it. I only hope they don't discontinue it any time soon because I really don't want to find another one and chances are, it will be much more expensive. At this price you should definitely try this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Pleasant smell, non-irritating, non-drying does it what it claims! I was depressed over how my skin was looking & tried Proactiv but that stuff made my condition worse, with this & the Neutrogena, Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Blemish cream, I noticed a noticable difference the next day even my mom said that my skin was pretty! Don't expect a big lather with this in fact, it's actually a good thing it doesn't lather too much (it's just right) because that can be drying to your skin just as they say you don't want an uber soapy shampoo that lathers too much because that can strip the oils from your hair drying it out. I LOVE THIS STUFF, & being on a fixed income I needed something I can afford that actually delivered on it's promises!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was using neutrogena rapid anti wrinkle night moisturizer... By the way I am 36 and have 2 lines in the forehead and a wrinkle in the nose in between eyes. And also lines around eyes... I don't prefer to use chemicals near eyes.. So I use organic natural product for around eyes. The rapid anti wrinkle was good.. Still I felt it might be too strong and I don't need it now .. In late 30s... Might be in late 40s... So tried this cream which is milder... I am using it for the last 2 weeks... When I wake up every morning and see myself in the mirror... I feel like my face is super clean, fresh and soft...doesn't  break out my combination skin... So far so good... Will continue using this"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have oily acne prone skin and I started getting fine lines around my eyes. I usually like Neutrogena products but this one is a dud. First, it doesn't lather at all. I've had an issue w/ it actually sliding off my hands a few times since it doesn't lather. Second it has a weird smell. Third it doesn't work. I'm delusional in thinking that a few months using the product will suddenly make my fine lines disappear but there is no difference at all. Plus my skin is still oily and I've broken out several times since I started using it. After this bottle I'm done. I'm in the market for something new."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried nearly all of the major anti-aging creams out there. I've tried all the big drugstore brands (olay, Roc, etc), I've tried department store brands (clinique, origins, etc), and I keep coming back to this one every time. I love that it does not have a fragrance (the overpowering scent of perfume is what turned me off from Roc). I love that it's not greasy, but yet it gives me just the right amount of moisture before bed. Most of all, I love that this 30-something girl still gets carded regularly when I buy a bottle of wine at the grocery store. Really, what more can a girl ask for from a wrinkle cream?"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "All the neutrogena are very effective when it comes to anti wrinkle and acne fighting, only draw back if you are prone to have sensitive skin like me, be careful how much you apply, and how often you apply it, otherwise it will really dry your skin out and your skin becomes very itchy.So make sure to follow the directions, do only apply to the effected area, stay away from anywhere from the eye area, about 1 inch at least, and try it out first and use it every other day or so.Even as I keep my Neutrogena products on hand for emergencies,:) , for the day to day use you maybe want to check out the Lush products that are also on sale here on Amazon. Dream Creme, amazing moisturizer(also for people who have dry skin due to Caner treatments !!!!) , Vanishing creme, amazing moisturizer for acne prone skin, deminishes redness, acne scars, and Herbalism, an organic cleanser."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is an amazing night cream. I wanted to try a mild retinol product to see how it affected my acne prone skin and I am happy to say that there are only two products in the world that do not make me break out after using it and this is one of them. I noticed my skin was much smoother after just the first application and only improved afterwards. No tingling or burning as with other retinol products and I even applied it around my eyes without any negative reactions. There wasn't any significant improvement with the fine wrinkles that I have on my forehead due to sun exposure but it is still a wonderful night cream. Overall, I definitely recommend this product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this product in despair after Neutrogena discontinued Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment. But I found I liked this product better. True I am older and it is time to switch to a more intense moisturizing regime, but this product really worked. I know Neutrogena has put Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment back on the market but I am sticking with this Anti-wrinkle stuff from now on. I highly recommend this to anyone over the age of 25 who has the intelligence to wash their face before bedtime. Use this, it may not get rid of wrinkles but it really does keep your face softer and prevents peeling and helps heal sun damage. I speak from experience. This stuff is not a miracle (most products are not) but it really does a good job and the price is very reasonable."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "As a body oil it's just fine.... I like to use a cap full in a bath. It makes my skin very soft. It will make your bathtub just disgusting though, you will have to clean it after.But the smell.... It's not my favorite to begin with, but it's ok. It's just SO strong!!!!! I give it 3 stars because it works well and does what it supposed to, but I actually don't use it. I can't handle the scent, or its strength of scent I guess."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have tried all kinds of oils over the years to combat dry skin.  I love this Neutrogena body oil, I love the large bottle it comes in, it has a great flip top that makes it easy to use, without making a huge oily mess.  It smells great, it goes on smoothly and is easy to blend in.  I will be ordering more of this, it works so well.  It has helped me get rid of a patch of very dry skin I had on the back of my neck.  I just put this on after a shower, when the skin is still moist.  It really moisturizes and isn't greasy."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It does not smell like sesame oil at all, which is good. Not like the smell of food. It actually has a very pleasant smell.  Oil is not too thick.  Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing. Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter.  It helps you to stay a little bit warm.  Helps your skin to keep it from drying.  Not bad to use for massage, but kinda expensive for that purpose."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This goes on soooooo easily and absorbs quickly into my skin.  There is a very slight shimmer upon application.  NOT greasy at all!!!!  Since this product is fragrance-free, I've also used it in my hair, and it works as well as the Fekkai hair oil I use.  It's thin so it would be hard to overdo it like lotion.  The only thing is that when I'm in a rush, some oil droplets find their way to the floor or my counter.  Easy peasy to clean though."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have to start out by saying that I am really not a fan of Neutrogena products. This is one of the exceptions. Three days after starting Accutane, I ran out of my expensive moisturizer (Physiodermie - Oily Skin Cream - 50ml) and had to run to the drugstore to buy moisturizer. I had a meltdown because they didn't have Olay in stock and bought Aveeno, Cetaphil, and this. This is the best, by a long shot. It feels nearly as good as my expensive one, but it doesn't sink into the skin quite as fast. The only downside is the smell, which is of clay. I don't mind it, since that proves it is fragrance free-- I just wish it was a little less strong.My favorite drugstore moisturizer is stillOlay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, 1.7-Fluid Ounce, but I would definitely repurchase this neutrogena moisturizer!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Neutrogena oil free moisture SPF 15 is amazing. The bottle has a little pump that makes it very easy to dispense. The product goes very far and you only need a little bit. This product is great for people with dry/semidry or combination skin. It helps combat dry skin in the places that need it without adding additional oil. It is also good to put under makeup. It causes much less foundation to be used up due to the fact that the skin is already moisturized. It also has SPF 15 which is great for the summer when you're not outside for long periods of time. (For long periods of sun exposure, I would suggest a higher SPF.) This product does smell a bit like sunscreen so there's no secret to what you're using!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have oily skin to the point where I avoided using moisturizer as every one that I tried in the past made by skin even oilier. It was embarrassing! I decided to give this one a try because of what it says it does and because I somehow developed small patches of dry skin on my face that needed to be treated, even though I was still oily. This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My skin feels so smooth after application with no greasy after feel and I am totally shocked to see how well it has kept my makeup in place. I did not have to blot once during the day while at work. It's been 12 hours since I applied it today and my face still looks great. This product really works!!! I am overjoyed that I decided to give it a try and highly recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this facial moisturizer recently, as well as farther back a year or so. Both times I have ended up returning it, mind you I didn't purchase this on Amazon, but rather stores in-person at stores like Walmart and Target. This moisturizer says it is hypo-allergenic although I don't buy it. I am allergic to basically everything and rely on mainly baby products. I have very fair, sensitive skin and acne. I do not find this moisturizes, but rather burns one's skin horribly. After using the moisturizer, I had eroded, scabby sores all over my face. I think it made my skin much worse, although I am not supposed to be allergic to any of the ingredients. Also, for you fellow fair-skinned folks, it makes your skin look very red and ruddy in a bad way. Do not buy this, you will regret it, or at least I did."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had meant to order the SPF version, which comes out of the pump a white color.  This is a creamy-whitish.  Nothing wrong with that, but I need the SPF coverage and I actually use it to lighten up my light tinted moisturizer...I'm kinda pale, so I will stick with the SPF next time.  That said, I still use this sometimes at night or if I know I will be bumming around the house all day with no fun-in-the-sun.  It is lightweight and, like all Neutrogena products, of high quality."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have 30 years old, white female. Had acne all thru my 20s, it's clearing up the older Im getting but this moisturizer has been a LIFE saver. I have tried so many other products out there, Simple, Clinique, Coconut Oil, Oil of Olay, etc... and nothing worked. They were too greasy, too smelly and caused breakouts or over drying and made my skin feel tight. Read many reviews on this, purchased this at my local Walmart and have been IN LOVE with this ever since. I use before my makeup every morning. 1 pump is plenty- apply to face, let dry (5 mins or so) and then apply makeup. I use a Neutrogena Night cream as a night moisturizer, but this would work fine too! So happy with this. No break outs, leaves my skin feeling wonderful and just enough moisture to NOT be oily! Deff reccommend this as a try! : )"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For years I have struggled with dry, acne-prone skin, and all moisturizers I tried caused me to break out, left my face feeling oily, or would wear-off and would need to be re-applied throughout the day. This is the first moisturizer I have tried that works for my sensitive skin without any of those problems.This product dissolves quickly without oily residue and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day (until I wash my face my again).  I use this product twice a day (morning and night) after I wash my face, and I love it!  If you are struggling to find a good facial moisturizer, I would definitely recommend this product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I chose tiis moisturizer because it did not have SPF in it and it was advertised as not to clog the pore on my face.  I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay.  I have always used a moisturizer after shaving, it does a far better job of soothing the skin thanalcohol based products P.S. after about 1/2 of the bottle the pump no longer will pump and you are left with 1/2 bottle that you have to beat out with your hand to get it.... I won't make this mistake again of ordering this... Shame of them..."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I use this both night AND morning and have never experienced a break out, rash, or any such thing. I used to use Clinique oil-free \"moisture in control\" because I would frequently break out. While I didn't break out after using it, my skin didn't feel moisturized, and after turning 40 that is key. I've been using Neutrogena Light Night Cream for over a year and love that it also contains few ingredients, no fragrance and NO sunscreen. Personally I don't like the idea of rubbing sunscreen into my face every morning, especially when I don't spend much time outside during the day. So I recommend giving this a try for both morning and night applications for sensitive skin. It makes my skin soft and moisturized but never greasy feeling. I use this in conjunction with Regenerist for sensitive skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "After having my baby I developed a rash on my hands from overwashing and extremely dry skin. I visited a dermatologist who prescribed me a steroid cream to get rid of the rash and samples of this hand cream. He insisted I use this every time I wash my hands to keep them moisturized so I would not have another rash breakout. I have been using this for over a year now and do not have dry chapped skin. I still wash my hands about 20 times a day so this is a life saver!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This creme is super heavy duty, but tends to disappear as it soaks in.  Great for hands and feet. Being in Arizona, I am always having to apply some kind of creme to my heels and hands to combat dryness. I've run through about a dozen, high-end and low-end, but nothing works quite like the Norwegian Formula. Must be all the glycerin?I wouldn't use it on my face, obviously, but anywhere you have itchy, cracked or super dry skin, go for it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First of all, thank you to all the other reviewers who persuaded me to give the Norwegian Formula Hand Cream a try! I can't remember the last time my hands were this soft... if ever.It took a little less than 7 days of regular use to smooth my rough, winter skin and now my hands are soft all the time and that includes after washing dishes.  There is no scent so the men in the household also did not mind giving it a try. I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from chronically dry, rough hands and probably will never buy another brand of hand cream again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This stuff really does work. The hype is real. I have been using Crabtree & Evelyn's gardner's hand therapy for years and have really liked it, but this stuff just plain works better. The other stuff is good though, if you need an alternative, but it's more expensive and frankly isn't as good.I live in the Pacific Northwest, which typically doesn't have a very dry climate. But we are having a very cold spell right now with no moisture in the air and my skin is drying up something awful. And, this stuff has saved my hands and, believe it or not, my face! I use argan & maracuja oils on my face typically and they do wonders, but this magic potion is taking care of a pesky dry spot on my face as we speak.This stuff is fragrance free too, so any of you sensitive folks will have no problem. And a little goes a long way as it is very concentrated."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This hand cream was created for use by Norwegian fishermen working in the North Atlantic.  There is nothing glamorous about it. It doesn't have pretty packaging, there is no pretty fragrance, it tends to be a little slow to absorb and it is gooey if you get  too much on.  However...it is hands down, without a doubt, the hand cream that produces the best results over any other, in my opinion.  I use it at night (I use a more easily absorbed cream during the day) and the next morning my hands are kitten-soft and incredibly smooth.  Not surprising.  After all, if it can help those fishermen braving the icey waters of the North Atlantic, think what it can do with our hands!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My mom started using this product and has been \"addicted\" to it ever since. She uses it when her hands are dry any time of the year. I was a little skeptical of this \"miracle cure\" (as said by my mom), but when I tried it out I must say that I was pretty impressed. My dry skin went from being rough and ,well, dry to smooth and moist (but not too moist . .just enough to feel nice). The only problem I had with this hand cream was that it was very thick and it made my hands very sticky/slippery for quite some time . .a longer time than most lotions/hand creams. . .But, after it dried out some, everything was cool . .."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Neutrogena hand cream is just about the best heavy-duty hand lotion out there.  It isn't nearly as greasy as many of the hand creams on the market.  It is quick and easy to apply because it rubs into your skin fairy quickly, yet its effects are long lasting.  Using this cream a couple of times a day really helps my chapped hands.The only drawback of this product as far as I'm concerned is its packaging.  The old version of this product used to have a flip-top cap which was much easier to use and less messy than the screw-on cap which the new version has."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "All 3  arrived in great condition, and I use quite a lot of this product in the Summer time. I have tried so many other costly sunscreen products, and found them all to be rather sticky.  I am handicapped and like to sit outside in good weather. I used to freckle up so much, even though many sunscreens say up to 30 minutes.  But with this light formula I don't have to use very much, and I don't look like our Dalmatian.  This is sort of funny, but when I used other sunscreen products my sweet dog didn't like the smell and she wouldn't sit real close to me out  side.  Animals are very sensitive to smells.  It is a very nice product, and I'm sure that other customers will enjoy it also as the moisturizer keeps the skin so nice and soft."}

{"label": 4, "raw": "I will readily admit that the ingredients are not great. That's why I gave 4 out 5 stars. But... It works. I've got dry skin specially because I live in a dry climate. After washing my face, it would be greasy looking in less than an hour. I realized my skin was too dry and it was overcompensating. The area around my eyes has drastically improved and my skin isn't as greasy looking.Since using this product for a few months, it does clog my skin. I now only use it around my eyes, cleaning gently with a washcloth.  I have seen a big difference in keeping the area around my eyes moisterized."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This does have the extra ingredients that some people on here are unhappy about, but it does not sting or burn me whatsoever. It feels very mild and nice on my face. Everybody was raving about the smell, so I was surprised when I opened it and realized that the smell is kind of like a grandmother's perfume. It's not a bad smell at all, though. The cream takes my make-up off nicely, even tough liquid liner. I was really surprised by how small the jar actually is, but after using it I realized that this stuff will last me forever. You only need a very small amount to do the trick. Overall, I'd recommend this to anybody!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I never taken care of my face as I should so I ordered a jar of this to start the process. Turning 30 is boring and hard. so far this has been a really, really great choice!! I have very sensitive skin and I get little to no breakouts and this lotion has been a perfect balance to keep that consistent. I've tried other lotions that claimed to be amazing (I'm looking at you Lush) and have either broken out of the ingredients have dried my skin out drastically.I will buy this again and continue to use it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have extremely dry skin...if I scratch my face in certain areas, like around my nose, skin flakes off, it's so dry. So of course I've tried every kind of moisturizer out there. This has worked the best for me. You only need a littlebit, I put it on and my face stays moisturized all day without my skin soaking it up and drying right back out. But it's definitely only for dry skin. Other people will say its greasy, but if your skin is truly dry like mine, It'll soak it right up and stay moisturized and it won't look greasy."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Thank you Amazon for finding an importer for this makeup.  When Max Factor stopped selling in the US, I was devastated.  I then found it at another place online, but they stopped carrying it too.  I hope this vendor will continue the relationship with Amazon.This makeup is creamy, covers well, and comes in a variety of shades to blend with almost any skin tone.  And it is a lasting makeup.  I get several month's use from each tube.  I also love this makeup, because I no longer have to worry about spills when I travel.  It's not magic, but it will cover those flaws and blemishes, of which I have far too many.  It doesn't cake or look garish.  What else can you say?  It works!It is expensive, since it has to be imported, but it is worth the cost to me to.  I love using it that much."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I tried this product while looking for a replacement for the Neutrogena Visibly Firm lotion that has now apparently been discontinued.  I am NOT impressed.  It reeks of \"that sunscreen smell\" and leaves my face feeling greasy for hours.  It does not work well under makeup - the face ends up with a somewhat smeary look, similar to the look you get on a hot day when you've been sweating buckets.  Additionally, it causes a very uncomfortable burning sensation if you get even the tiniest bit in an eye.I now only apply this product on my neck and d&eacute;colletage. While it does seem to work pretty well as a moisturizer, I will not be purchasing any more when the two-pack has been used up.Disappointing."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have dry, sensitive skin. I've tried a number of cleansers like this one (Cetaphil, Ponds cold cream, Boots cleansing lotion, etc.) and this one seems to work the best. It takes make up off well and doesn't leave behind a 'filmy' feeling if you just wipe off.  If you do rinse with water, it doesn't leave you with a tight, squeeky-clean feeling. It really does leave your skin feeling moisturized and yet cleanses enough to get rid of the dirt and make-up!  I'm very happy with this cleanser and will purchase again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Okay - I agree with others that this face wash can be drying.  I would not use it.  However, my husband swears by it and I see his results.  He has been cursed with horrible problem skin that can have bad cystic acne breakouts even though he is in his fifties.  If he goes even a few days without using Deep Clean he will begin breaking out.  He is a firefighter and is usually very good about bringing all of his grooming items when he works a 24 or 48-hour shift.  Occasionally he forgets an item.  If this is the item , you can tell even if he had to use a different product for as little as one day.I have to believe what I see and his testimonial."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've found this cleanser does a great job of removing light to moderate oil/dirt from the skin without overdrying.  It is a cream based cleanser with no abrasives in it, so it's very gentle on the skin as well.I usually rub a little bit on my skin with my hands, then wash it off with water.  This is good for when you just need a light cleansing.  You can put a little on a wash rag, then rub your skin with the rag if you need a more robust cleaning.Overall a great product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "When they say deep clean they mean it.  I have sensitive skin and don't normally use astringent products like this but right after I had my baby I was only getting the chance to wash my face about twice a week.  My normal cleanser (which I typically used every day) wasn't getting my face clean when used so infrequently so I tried this and it was a great find.  I understand why some people felt it was too harsh and I would never use it every day, but if you have oily skin and are only getting the chance to wash every few days this is a great way to go.  One problem was that it did dry out my lips if it ran over my mouth when I rinsed my face, so I spread a little petroleum on them first and that did the trick."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love love love this cleanser!!! I'm changing products all the time to see if I find a better fit, but I always come back to this cleanser! It feels sooo good on my combination acne prone skin. It doesn't dry it out, however I can feel it cleanses very well. I like to leave it on as a mask during the time I brush my teeth (about 5 min or so), then when I rinse it off my skin feels amazing, there's a light tingling feeling and incredible deep clean sensation! They say it contains beta hydroxy, so I'm guessing it's acting a little kind of like very light peeling, refreshing your complexion every time..."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this cleanser for years and I love it.  It does a good job cleaning your skin, while also leaving it soft.A few months ago I switched over to Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser.  In comparing the two products, the Biore does a much better job cleansing your skin.  When I am wearing make-up, the Neutrogena Deep Clean always left a little reside behind.  The Biore, however, never did.But, after using Biore for 3 months, I decided to go back to Neutrogena for daily use.  The Biore was just too drying.  I never had a problem with dry skin with Neutrogena.  So, back to what I used for years before.  I'll still use the Biore for the few times a week that I wear make-up...but, for every other day, I am going to use Neutrogena.My husband also uses this and loves it as well."}

These pads irritated my eyes because they are scratchy and they have soooooo much oil on them.  One word: Horrible!  I have to use a paper towel to soak up the oil first before I put these on my eyes and it's still that bad.  I only got them because I love Almay make-up towellete like wipes.  Boy was that a big mistake.  Stay-away from these pads."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have used both the moisturizing and the oil-free version of this makeup remover. Now, I will only rebuy the moisturizing one. The oil-free one was terrible.I can deal with having a bit of oil around my eyes after removing makeup, especially if it is moisturizing the area like it says it does. I end up going to sleep anyway after removing makeup, so it isn't a big deal. The formula is extremely gentle and it does its job without irritating the eyes. And if you don't want the oil around your eyes after removing the makeup, just take a towel and wipe it off. It is not a big deal.The oil-free one, on the other hand, irritated my eyes to no end! I couldn't even finish the container. My eyes became really red and bloodshot and I just couldn't keep using them. I am going to throw these out and re-buy the moisturizing ones."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this because it was on the top ten colognes for men on some site i went too on google. Anyways, it smells really great and lasts all day. I work in a corporate office and its 8 hour days and this scent lasts well pass the time i get home. Warning: you dont need a lot of sprays for this, a few well placed squirts around the neck and the wrists and your good to go. I recommend this, it came well before the estimated delivery time, nothing was tampered with and it smells really great. Get this fragrance and smell like a BOSS!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Early in my married days we were living, well let's call it, a low-income life. With a baby on the way I picked up another (lower-cost) brand. The sticks were harder and the cotton wasn't nearly as puffy and soft.All I can say is that on this item you CAN tell the difference!So in my house we always carry the Q-tips brand of cotton swabs and I must admit we also use a decent (and soft) toilet paper as well.Some things just aren't worth skimping on no matter how tight your budget."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "There's a reason why these guys have been around for years.  Their quality and price have made them the best value there is for cotton swabs.  They do the job, however interesting that that may be, and come back for more.  They're indispensable if you have a baby or young children, but they grow with you into adulthood as well.  There's some things you shouldn't buy the generic and this is one of them.  They've been around for years and for good reason - they're great!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For starters, my hair LOOOOOVES color. Soaks it right up and does great with almost all cheapo home kits.I got to the color on the box from very dark brown in about 3 colorings that were spaced out, hence the 4 stars. I have a lot of red in my hair and it really kept the brassiness to the minimum while I worked on getting to a lighter shade. there is a lot of really nice dimension to the color as well, making it look naturally blonde.I also ignored the timing instructions. I always apply my color the same way (roots to ends) and leave it on for 45 minutes no matter what. I also cover my hair with a plastic cover to keep heat in and help the color set.I finally got bored of the upkeep this color required as far as roots go and went back to my natural, but it was a fun (and cheap) way to go medium blonde for a while."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I like the ombre look. So i decided to try this after all of the tutorials Ive watched.Long story short, I think this look is okay.....Its definitely looks better with your hair curled, like a light wavy....But thats just my opinion....Its a very nice product, everything you need is right there in the box.You can achieve any look with this.i will say my first time, my hair did turn brassy copper color.But i bought a second box by accident and re did my color, and its a nice honey blonde....."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I rarely see copper colors in the drugstores so I was happy to find this on Amazon. I've been coloring my hair red for years but I have found that the coppery reds are much more flattering. And as I tend to leave the mixture on longer than required as i usually get distracted, this does not leave reddish- purply tones. When I colored my hair today I left in on for an hour and it looks rich and gorgeous. Feria colors don't seem to fade as fast either. Great product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Bought this product at walmart for $10...  waste of money!!  I am mosltly platinum and had a few yellow tones and brassy streaks that I wanted toned out..  I've used feria before but just the darker brown colors.  It did tone out the yellow.. not so much the brass though....  the damage is horrid!!  It feels like it did the first day a bleached it from black..  save your money and your hair and go to sally's and get a quality lightening cream."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this color regularly for 4 years. I love it.It's a very bright carrot-y color at first, but as it fades it becomes a very natural red. I have seen many surprised reactions when I tell people that I am not a natural red head.This is the ONLY brand that I will buy an orange-y red from. It's the only brand with the vibrancy I want.TIPS:-when dying your hair red spray windex on anything you accidentally get hair dye on (it'll come off near immediately)-DO NOT wash your hair for 3-4 days after dying your hair red (it helps lock the color in)-DO NOT use shampoos with sulfate in them (they cause the color to fade extremely quickly)-depending on how much it fades and how long it's been you may have to completely redye your hair instead of touching up on it because of the color difference between when you first dye it and when it fadesGood luck!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bleached my hair to a mostly yellow, slightly orange color and then applied this product to take it to the next level, to the color I wanted my hair to be. Instead, my hair is yellow-blond. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice color, just not the one I was hoping for. For that reason, I would say it's not worth the time or money. However, I gave it 2 stars because the conditioner it comes with is FANTASTIC! It's a nice purple anti-brass conditioner that works like a miracle at toning brassiness (to some degree anyway...)and leaves your hair feeling healthy and smelling like heaven. But other than that, I'm disappointed with my result and I'm sure it's human error to some degree but I wasn't that far off and expected the tone of my hair to cool somewhat to be closer to what was on the package. Will not purchase again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't like spending a lot of money and I don't like going to get my hair done. Over the years I try to save money by buying the cheaper boxes but my hair never turns out the way I want it to. When I use Feria it comes out exactly how I want it each time. I also love that it's pretty much the only box that gives out true highlights. It's amazing. Other plus about Feria is that it comes with a lot of actual product. Meaning if you have long hair you only need to buy one box! In the end it's just better to spend a couple more dollars to make yourself look great. I've never had a problem with any Feria hair colors. I love it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I wanted a coppery orange color and i had dyed black hair so i picked this up to strip the color out (this is something i've done before with other brands with no problem) however, this formula is so crazy thick it didnt spread at all and my hair turned out so splotchy because of it. This product was not meant to be your standard bleaching kit, its for people with already light hair who want to go lighter, If your dark like me and wanted to go lighter i suggest manic panic bleaching kit or splat."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Don't bother! What a waste of time. On the side of the box it states what color your hair will turn out based on the color of your hair. My hair is dark brown/ black.  The turnout color would be a bright intense red, exactly what I wanted. What color did my hair come out? Dark brown/ black with a hint of red in the sunlight. Nothing like it states on the side of the box.  I pursed this product over another based on the color chart and spent extra to get it.  Won't ever buy from L'Oreal again!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have not been able to find this conditioner anywhere until I spotted it on Amazon. Because it's a spray mist, it's much easier to control where and how much I want to apply, which I like because my hair is fine and most bottled conditioners weigh it down, even after ample rinsing.  This spray also enhances the highlights in my hair - I don't know why since it's not meant to do that, but I don't mind. The scent is wonderful and light. I purchased a 3/pk for about $11 with free Prime shipping so for now, I'm a happy camper!  Thanks again Amazon....."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Never tried this brand before, I have super damaged hair from recently going from red to pink to platinum to black, this helps as a detangler,  though I don't think is actually doing anything to long term improve my damaged hair (I don't think any product would though). What I like most is it doesn't make my hair oily or greasy and I can still go 2 days between washings without getting the greasy look a lot of leave in products have over time. I give 3 stars because I'm just not wowed, still looking for something that will actually help repair my hair. As just a detangler it would be a 5 though."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought a bottle of this a few years ago and it had tea tree in it and it was absolutely amazing stuff and really great for my itchy scalp. My hair never looked better. Now, they've replaced the tea tree with aloe and it now has a better pina colada type smell. Delicious, summery smell, by the way. Without the tea tree, the product is not as good as it used to be, but I will continue using it because the ingredient list is top notch and the smell is so yummy. There's really no need to spend more money buying salon products when you can get stuff that's just as good or better for a fraction of the cost. One bottle of this is $2.50 at my local Wal-mart. You can't beat that!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm becoming obsessed with hair products so now I always like to have something in my hair even when I'm not styling it. I love this product because it's a spray, and it's quick to use. It doesn't leave my hands sticky, and I can put it in my hair as soon as I get out of the shower. I use it before I use other hair products too. Plus, it smells really good!I mostly love it because it's a spray and not a cream. It's cheap, and I will definitely be buying this again when I run out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product smells great. It has a coconut/beachy/light smell that fades so it is not overpowering at all. I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner, then spray it on my dry hair and comb thru. It leaves my hair super soft and smooth. I even used it a day after washing my hair when I woke in the morning to smooth out bed head. It does not leave your hair greasy or weighed down at all. Not sure how that is possible but I love it. I have atomic pink hair and it does not fade my color."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "In my quest to find the best products for my hair, I purchased this leave-in on a whim, thinking the spray bottle would add convenience to my overall hair regimen. I was so wrong. This product left my hair extremely dry and difficult to manage. I expected it to work like other leave-ins and provide moisture, but all it did was suck the moisture out and leave behind something resembling a helmet. lol The bottle states that the product contains silk protein, but I think there is more protein than moisturizing ingredients, hence the hard hair. I will not be purchasing this again in the future and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I ADORE this leave-in conditioner! It smells nice, it works great, and it doesn't leave a nasty feeling residue in my hair! I have very curly hair, and live in a humid climate. This stuff was GREAT for humid days. I use it EVERY day after showering, before I put in any other products, and it helps keep my hair from damage due to styling products. If I use just the conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and less frizzy. It's WONDERFUL stuff, and Amazon has a GREAT price!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price.  It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this, I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless.  When I got home, I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product.  I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original, almost-odorless formula."}

In addition it works fine as a body wash, which means that I can clean the entirety of their sweaty, mud splattered little bodies with one product.

{"label": 4, "raw": "This shampoo does not smell like strawberry. It smells like Jolly Rancher or Starburst strawberry flavored candy. Perhaps a bit like Marie Callender's frozen strawberry pie.  It is sweet and artificial, but not too strong. Nevertheless, I love it. It takes me back to junior high almost instantly  (when I was 12, I purchased any personal care product based on the way it smelled...bonus points for fruity). It lathers well and removes any conditioner product you might have used the prior day/week/year. If you have dry hair and are looking for conditioning shampoo, look elsewhere. This is a shampoo for stripping your hair of excess product. It is not organic, it is not eco-friendly, and it is not really natural. I use it when I need to clarify my hair (and take a nostalgic return to 9th grade)."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased several bottles of Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo when Amazon had it on sale for $1.24. At that price, it was a real bargain. It is a decent shampoo, that didn't dry out or leave my \"normal\" hair greasy. The shampoo is a poor man's Nexxus or Paul Mitchell formula. Having used both of those over the years, the Suave version isn't as good. If you have dry or damaged hair, you may want to look elsewhere. Also, the current Amazon price is $5.99. There is no way I'd pay this for a Suave product. If you can get it on sale, and have \"normal\" hair though, I can recommend Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "After reading all the reviews on this face powder I was a bit let down.  I have been using it for about a week now and it does not to seem to control the shine any better than all the other face powders I have tried.  I put my makeup on around 7:30 and around 9 am the shine is already coming through on my T-zone.  If I apply it every hour I suppose it would keep the shine down but the whole purpose was something I did not have to keep applying.  Also I got Golden and it is a bit light.  It is a nice feeling powder and I do like the case and the puff unfortunately it does not control the shine like I hoped."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This powder really does what it says, controls shine! I have relatively shiny skin, especially in my T-zone, so I have to dab it on there & it takes the shine right out.

I also use it for touch ups.. A LOT! It lasts quite awhile & doesn't feel heavy or cakey at all. I definitely recommend for someone who is looking for something that is JUST as good as high end powders! The only downside is the powder puff it comes with falls apart VERY easily. I bought my last compact just 3 weeks ago & its completely falling apart! But it's an easy fix because I just use my blush brush to apply it for touch ups. Just wish it came with a better quality puff. It's worth it though for the LOW PRICE! I just recommend tossing the puff & buying a better quality one that can be washed over & over or simply by using a powder/blush brush. Other than that I love this stuff!!"}

This Maybelline remover works so very well, removes all of my makeup, doesn't leave my eyes greasy or leave remnants of mascara behind.  It even removes waterproof mascara.  I used Lancome for a while, and honestly, this works better and is so much less expensive.  Everyone should at least try it before buying expensive brands."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Recommended.I have used this to set my L'oreal True Match liquid makeup for years. I have fairly pale skin, and this is the only powder I've found to match my skin tone. Most powders have a tendency to run pink, and I have decidedly warm undertones, so I was pleasantly pleased to find a powder that won't turn my face orange. I have also used CoverGirl's similar powder foundation, which runs slightly more pink than this (though I'd probably classify it more neutral...), and I have a tendency to buy whichever one's cheaper at the drug store. I do not, however, like the powder puff that comes with this product. It's the thin, flat, cloth-type thing that might work better for some people but cakes the powder over my foundation. Whenever I purchase this powder, I use my own face brush to apply it."}

You can wear it alone for some light coverage and to feel clean when lounging around or wear it over/under makeup to stay looking matte much longer. If you've got super oily skin, you need this. Don't expect all your problems to be solved.. you'll still need oil blotting sheets and your usual methods, but I find this to be a big help. For under $5, you can't go wrong!"}

I get compliments every time. I have found that my ombre lip works BESTEST ;) with this lipstick. I've tried it with mac ones and its never as good! This lipstick is a staple in  my collection. Very quick shipping !"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I recently bought two gorgeous colors of Revlon lipstick: Fabulous Fig and Highbeam Tan. I was pleased to discover that the Fabulous Fig rates surprisingly safe on the EWG Skindeep site, but the Highbeam Tan has a poor score and is full of parabens and other junk. It's too bad, because Highbeam Tan is such a fantastic color. I wish companies like Revlon would clean up the ingredients in their products. It isn't that hard, or that expensive, to make lipstick that contains safer ingredients. The Fabulous Fig vs. the Highbeam Tan is a perfect example of this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love the formula for the Revlon Super Lustrous Lipsticks - I own a handful of different shades and this was an excellent addition.  The lipstick is creamy but not sticky and doesn't bleed even without lip liner.  The shade is very opaque and gets good color on one swipe, but I find it has better staying power after a dab with some tissue and then reapplication.  The color itself is perfectly neutral for my lips, evens the color out slightly and adds the barest natural pink to my lips.  Not sure how that'll help other people, but I've got lightly tanned/olive skin tone for some perspective.  10/10 would buy again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this for my mom who loves the color. She wants me to get a couple more because she's wants backups.I tried it several times and I would say the formula is VERY good for a lipstick at this price point. It doesn't last amazingly long and isn't as AMAZING as some of the more expensive lipsticks I own (Estee Lauder, Mac). But the difference in price is HUGE. And if you're okay with several touch ups in the day, it makes a good every day lipstick."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First, other reviewers are correct that what is pictured is not what you'll receive. The shape is different, the handles aren't the same shape, the pads are silicon rather than the rubber we're used to, etc. It threw me for a moment... but then I used the curlers. I have used Revlon lash curlers for as long as I can remember and love them. This actually curls my lashes better than all the ones I've previously owned so I don't care that they aren't what is pictured. I don't know if it's the slightly bent shape, the larger head, the silicone pads, or what, but my lashes are completely curled - nice sweep-up effect - and the curl seems to stay much longer. I highly recommend them."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This soap is just ok; it sort of makes my skin feel a bit like it has a film on it or something, but perhaps I just need to get used to it.  I quit using sulphate soaps, and I use this or Dr. Bronner's Tea Tree Oil soap.UPDATE: I really love this soap, and my skin loves it too.  I have VERY sensitive skin, and I can't even use soap with a wash cloth, because I will itch when I get out of the shower if I do.  I really like how delicate this soap is on my skin.  I slather my arms and legs in coconut oil after the shower, and my skin has no irritation at all.  I will probably use this soap forever, as it cleans, but it doesn't make my skin angry.  The bar also lasts FOREVER; I have been using it everyday now for several months, and it's only halfway gone.  Great deal for the money :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This soap is AWESOME! I first found it at a discount store and the single bar lasted 8 months. I wash my face with it twice per day. Olive oil is the perfect for any skin type. Its nature's perfect moisturizer. The bar itself is extremely large so that it will not fit in a normal soap container. I was tempted to buy two just in case but its so large I will have it for awhile. Now that I think about it, I will buy more at the current price. You never know when it might go up in price."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I feel the need to write a review of this product mainly because of all the reviews saying its caustic.First let me say I am a soap maker and run a very successful business making cold process soap. Sometimes I don't get a batch made for myself and I have to buy some,so this was convenient and I bought it even after reading some of the terrible reviews. I have several means of testing soap for caustics I used every single one on this bar before using it on my skin,this soap is in NO way caustic! It's a pretty nice basic soap, a large bar, and came at a good price.When I neglect to have soap made for personal use I will definately purchase this product again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Love the smell and texture of this creme, a very small amount goes a very very long way. The smell is simply clean and makes you feel good, and I am very sensitive towards fragrances in lotions especially on my face.I did try this out under my make up, when i wear my Mac Studio Fix, I prefer to use Mac's prep and prime , as with only the moisturizer it seems to make my make up just a bit uneven, not badly, but i saw a bit of a difference.Might try it under the Prep and Prime as I am not sure if the Prep and Prime will give my dry prone face enough moisture.But i do love using this moisturizer to use with my cinema secrets creme foundation pallet, (must try ladies, and amazing beauty product)Overall I love the creme, will definitely re order, and for my break out sensitive prone skin, no issue either. Definitely recommend"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've only been using the product for a week morning and night and can say that it works for its intended purpose that I got it for. Within two days I saw drastically reduced puffiness and after four the dark circles were diminished enough that I felt okay without makeup to cover my severe dark circles.Granted, they are still there a little, but it has only been a week. All in all, I say it works pretty well considering I didn't really have high expectations at all. I'll wait and see if it holds up over time.I don't have any wrinkles around my eyes yet so I can't speak for that part, but maybe it'll help keep them away."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this for a few months now and this just moisturizes. For reference, I have normal, slightly oily lids. My eye area is incredibly sensitive to retinol. I have really dark circles, mostly due to genetics.Pros:-my skin has not reacted negatively to this product-first ingredient is water, making this a good starter moisturizer for beginners-does not sting or bother my eyes much if I accidentally get some in-affordableCons:-does not get rid of dark circles. There is white shimmer in this gel, which will reflect light making it seem like your dark circles are lighter.-does not get rid/fill in fine lines.-dries tacky. I've varied the amount I put on and there's still a tacky residue through out the day. Might be good for those who use makeup.Although I wouldn't buy this again, I would definitely recommend this product to those just starting out with eye creams. Also, this seems like it will last me a long time. I do use this twice a day."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been wanting to try a menstrual cup out but was hesitant. I decided to try these rather than the diva cup or reusable ones. I like the fact I can just throw it away. I was surprised I actually like this product!When inserting push back and down not up. I have not had a leak with this technique. I have not had any issues with it coming out. If you bear down too hard it might come out though. I put the garbage can right in front of me when taking the cup out. I really don't think it's messy at all. I pull it out slowly and am careful not to spill. You will obviously get blood on your fingers but you could put gloves on if it bothers you. I have not tried taking out or inserting a new cup in a public restroom. I would rather do this at home. It is really nice not having to worry about changing a tampon all the time!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I know there are some very long reviews about these. Here are my suggestions:1) watch the Youtube video and read other blogs/reviews on how to put them in. I had success my first time using and I think the extra research helped.2) I do feel pressure; it isn't true for me that you don't feel anything. I don't seem to have any extra cramping or discomfort other then feeling pressure in my lower, lower abdominal area though.3) I suggest taking these out in the shower if you can or follow the directions about using a medical glove so you have something to put it in to throw it away.I bought these mainly to use for intimacy during that time of the month and for that purpose these have worked great. I don't use these exclusively and still use tampons/pads as well. My partner has been thrilled with the results."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I was so hopeful about these. I wanted an alternative to tampons that was healthy and environmentally-friendly (and cheaper!) So I was excited to try them. But it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I don't want to get into vivid details. But basically, I was not warned that this would be such a MESSY ordeal. Not to mention it's not at all convenient. I do not want to leave it in for too long, because if I do, I know it's not absorbing any fluid, so I worry about leakage, or the horrible mess that it will make all over my hands when I try to take it out. GROSS! Also, the thing itself is absolutely huge. I imagine most people would look at it and be terrified to try to put it in their bodies. I believe there was a reason tampons became so much more popular than these methods. Sorry, but I've got to switch back."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I saw this and figure I would give them a try. When I finally got to use them I read the directions and scanned the square and watched the video. It took a few tries before I got it in place.( I have a injured back so there's not a whole lot I can do. ) I would stay in place for about three hours and then I would have to push it back in place. I still think it would be better if them did come in different sizes because I do feel it is to big. It might just be me cause I haven't had any kids."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had been using the DivaCup for a while and had a lot of success with it, but when I lost it a friend  gave me a pack of the softcups she had used once and didn't like. I thought since I had liked the other brand this would be much the same way... it wasn't I don't know how many times I tried to readjust things and try different angles or higher/lower inside the vaginal walls, I couldn't stop the cup from leaking. It wasn't horrible, but it was enough to ruin a couple of pairs of panties which ensured that I wasn't saving money on this alternative item and that I won't be using the brand again. It was an utter disappointment... I'd say try another brand instead like DivaCup or Lunette, I had good experiences with both."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this cleanser since my late teens. It is one of the best OTC acne medicines available, and slightly cheaper than other drugstore cleansers like Neutrogena. When used twice a day, the Clean and Clear greatly reduces the number of pimples I get. Also, it contains menthol, so it feels pleasantly tingly on skin (but do not get it into your eyes; it burns like the flames of he11!). There are only two drawbacks to this product: 1) It will dry out your skin, so wear a lotion and 2) The active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is a bleaching agent, so it will bleach fabric. I recommend using old wash cloths to wash your face and be very careful not to get it on your clothes."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this for about 6 months. Before I had been using Proactive. Proactive worked great for me for a while but eventually stopped clearing up my skin so I switched to Clean and Clear Continuous Control. My skin cleared right up and stays clear other than whiteheads. The only problem is that it's a little harsh on my skin. Usually irritates it if I leave it on but for a second. It also dries out my skin a lot. So I use it every other day. I get a couple pimples by using it every other day but it is still better than Proactive and AcneFree."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I dug this stuff out from under my cabinet...I had vowed never to use Clean and Clear again after my disaster breakout with the blackhead cleanser. But since this had no beads to irritate my skin, I decided to give it a try and it really worked!! 2 days after putting it on once or twice daily, I could see breakouts that were starting to come had faded, and my blackheads were actually disappearing from my nose! There's a little bit of a stingy feeling, and if you get it in your eyes it hurts like a bitch, and your face is pretty red afterward, I'm assuming from the chemical contents. But it makes your skin smooth as a baby's bottom if you use it everyday, so your skin has a daily regimen and can fight breakouts. I highly recommend and will be back to buy more&lt;3 I'm a 15 year old girl if that helps."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I tried this product for 2 months and i have to say it didnt do anything for my acne. I am the type that breaks out when my period is about to start and using this pill didn't change a thing. I broke out just as i normally would and this last month even while using the pill was nearly the worst i've had. I'm sure must just be a coincidence. I am not saying this is not a good product as we have to keep in mind one thing can't and won't work for everyone as we all have different skin types. This just isn't for me and i have discontinued using this product and cannot really recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "this is one of my all time favorite products. It really evens out your skin tone and makes your skin glow! I use it at night before I go to bed and when I go to apply my makeup in the morning after my shower you can really see how even this stuff has made my skin appear. I'm 34 with no wrinkles and a few fine lines and I guess I had uneven skin tone because this stuff will make your skin looking absolutely amazing! fast absorbent, no smell - great results!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've only recently started incorporating toner into my facial cleansing program, but this is my favorite that I've tried so far. This toner leaves my face feeling very clean, yet soft (not tight or itchy), plus it has the benefits of an Alpha and Beta hydroxy. It really does help keep my pores cleaner, and therefore smaller over time. I find it to be perfect for my combination/oily skin, but for those with dry or sensitive skin the alcohol might be irritating or overly drying."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I washed my face with this once yesterday, and once the day before and yesterday in the evening, a good portion of the right side of my face and a few under my chin broke out in ugly hives! It itches horribly and it really hurts. To make matters worse, I had to go to work looking like this. I didn't want to put on makeup that would irritate my skin so I was forced to leave the house looking like a pepperoni pizza. :(And also, when I was washing my face with this, I noticed that the scrubbing beads in this were SCRATCHING my face. Not a comfortable exfoliation, but like sandpaper. And this cleanser has a very noticeable chemical smell to it. I wish that I had never wasted my money on this product, and I wish that I had never put this on my face!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this after reading reviews on multiple sites and seeing this toner ranked as one of the best when it comes to drug store brands.I've been using this every night for three weeks (I've skipped it by accident roughly 4 times) and my skin is noticeably clearer. Within a few days I noticed some of my trouble areas looked better and while the clearing process has been slow its noticeable and the progress steady. I also haven't seen a \"new\" blemish since adding this to my regimen.It hasn't done much for blackheads so a few days ago I purchased an exfoliant to address that issue around my nose.Overall I am very happy and will likely repurchase this when it runs out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am prone to breakouts and have tried Proactiv - which does work but it is too expensive for me to keep using, especially since my problem is hormonal/occasional. This product fits my needs perfectly. Whenever I see or feel a pimple coming on, I just take a Q-tip immersed in this astringent and clean that area - and that area only. I try not to wipe my whole face with it because it is drying. Last month my whole upper chest/neck area broke out for some reason. That was when I diligently wiped that area 2x a day, morning & night. Took care of the problem immediately."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried other astringents, and this one is the perfect balance of effective cleansing without overdrying.  Those who use this product alone probably do not get great results, but this is designed to be part of a skincare regimen, including moisturizing.  I use a mild face wash, then I use this astringent to help remove any makeup that did not get removed by the face wash (makeup remover gives me breakouts).  After that, I use Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish lotion.  It's a very simple regimen, but extremely effective.  I've tried other astringents in the same regimen, but they dried out my skin and had noticeably higher alcohol content, likely the cause of the over-drying."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is an excellent astringent, I had my doubts with products touting  \"oil eliminating\", \"oil free\" as they never seemed to work. This product does exactly what it's supposed to. The smell is similar to theNeutrogena Clear Pore Scruband it does not burn like some astringents do. I follow this with theNeutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30in the morning. I consider this product my \"holy grail\" in my skin care regimen. I kills the bacteria without killing my skin cells. It's an excellent product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful about what products I use when I have breakouts on my body (notably my shoulders and back).  My dermatologists recommended that I try the Neutrogrena Body Clear Body Wash, Pink Grapefruit for when I broke out.  She was adamant that I did not use it on a daily basis because my sensitive skin and she is right! This body wash is great for when you breakout during the summer months- the salicylic acid treats your pimples.  It does so quickly and without much irritation to my sensitive skin.  However, I thought because it was rather gentle when I did breakout that I could use it on a daily basis- WRONG.  After using it for about 5 days in a row, my skin was extremely irritated and very dry.  I would recommend that sensitive skin people only use this product when they breakout or KNOW they are going to breakout, otherwise it will dry out your skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am a hormonally challenged female and have been suffering from bacne lately, though it isn't typical. I decided to go ahead and try this body wash to see if it would help. What do you know -- just a day later and it was working quite well! I still have little blackheads, but no more big, really noticeable zits. I combined it with a really great exfoliating loofah and the skin on my back has gotten much better. It does smell pretty gross though - my husband thought he smelled something rank this morning in the shower, but I told him it was probably the body wash and when he sniffed it he confirmed. If you can deal with the smelliness while you're washing then it's worth it. I don't find that it leaves a residual smell at all."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this product for several years, and I love it. It smalles wonderful, it rinses clean, unlike some other body washes that I've used that leave residue. It's also not too drying, which is good, because my skin dries out really easily.During the summer, though, I tend to get blemishes on my shoulders and chest, and I've switched to the Neutrogena Body Scrub, which I find deals with acne a little better. It comes in an identical bottle to this, and has some exfoliating beads in it as well. If you don't have to wory about bodily acne, this is a great product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I ordered this because I needed a face moisturizer for nighttime wear.  I have had great success with Ester C creams - I am not old enough to have any severe wrinkles but it seems to be stopping what little creasing I had starting in its tracks.This cream is heavy and smells good.  I mixed some argan oil into it for an extra boost.  So far, my face feels very good after using this and I'm glad it comes in a very generous container for the price.  I would definitely recommend trying it, especially if you've been using stuff from a drugstore or supermarket - it's definitely nicer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I typically use Burt's Bees shampoo and love what it does for my hair, but not for my scalp (dry and itchy). I purchased this shampoo to use on occasion to prevent the itchy scalp it seems to cause. Plus, I love the refreshing tingle of tea tree shampoos.Let me just say, I honestly felt like I was being dipped for fleas the first time I used this product. It has a horrible chemical odor...EXACTLY like pesticide. I tried a few more times to stomach it, but just can't do it. Plus, you would think it would at least tingle a bit, with it smelling like Raid and all, but nope; NADA.Also, if you are looking for a shampoo that is organic with no SLS...READ THE LABEL! This product is not what it is marketed to be."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My husband and I both use this shampoo - he for light dandruff control, and me just because I like the way it cleans my fine hair.  It is paraben-free, and does not contain sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates.  The scent is not as refreshing as the scent of Jason Natural Cosmetics - Satin Shower Body Wash/Tea Tree Oil 30 fl oz Gel, which is a fabulous body wash, but it is not a bad scent.  You do need to watch that it doesn't get in your eyes, since tea tree oil can sting a bit."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My favorite wish is for Jason to make a bigger, less expensive bottle.  This is my favorite shampoo but I rarely buy it because of the cost.  If you have fine, wispy hair this will do wonders for the texture and feel of your hair!  It smells great and, as an added bonus, does great things for your scalp too!  Simply adore it.  Wether it actually THICKENS your hair... I don't know about that, BUT my superfine hair certainly FEELS more lush and lustrous after using this shampoo and conditioner... I just wish I could afford to use it exclusively, but for me this will have to remain a special occasion shampoo.  :(Note:  This stuff is THICK.  I mean it.  Almost like honey."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Jason's natural products are exceptional. I love the body wash and this product tends to be more expensive in stores so that's why I purchase on amazon. If you like the smell of  lavender, this product  will tickle your fancy.  Very nice during shower time.  The soap feels great on your skin and nourishes because it contians Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5 and aloe vera. Jason's body washes are known for no or low sulfides which is good for sensitive skins and the main reason I purchase.  I think what I love the most about this product is the bottle dispenser.  It's so easy to use in the shower and never had a problem with clogging.  It despenses down to the bottom of the bottle.This is a prime product which is a plus too.  Multiple purchase customer and I'll be back again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have used Jason products for many years, mainly because they do not test on animals. I believe that is very important to many people. This body wash lasts a  long time, just one pump onto my fluffy wash thing, (I never know what they call those little round net things we have so many of), anyway, one pump is enough to supply a ton of foaming suds that make you feel so clean and it rinses off so easily. Leaves my skin soft and not dry. I am a great fan of this body wash because I do like tea tree oil for it's antiseptic properties,  and  I also buy the lavender one, for it's soothing effect. I alternate between the two of them.  It is a great bargin for the price considering how much body wash we use.  I think it would be good for a large family of kids because the Koala bear is just too cute."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this for my boyfriend, he loves it. I ended up taking a shine to it as well so now we use it all the time. Tea Tree oil is great for oily skin and this particular wash smells great. We use it as a face wash and have had less break outs since we started using it. Best thing about Jason products is that they are organic, all natural, not tested on animals and contain no animal ingredients. Perfect for vegans or those who just care about what they use on their skin and bodies."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "In the past I've purchased a ton of LUSH beauty products because they make them with lots of essential oils. What I've realized is that I can make some scented liquid soaps myself by using essential oils and this Jason's Body Wash. Simply put a combination of oils in a small plastic bottle and add in some body wash. Shake and use. Some of my favorite combinations are sweet orange, neroli and rose. I've also tried Ylang Ylang, Patchouli, Lotus and Sandalwood. I'm looking forward to trying out new combinations as I have a big collection of essential oils. I also like Balsam Fir Needle which is refreshing. I find the body wash works well with a body brush.~The Rebecca Review"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Smell is so subjective it seems that it may not be a valid review point. One person may love the smell of something and another person hate it. That being said, I like the smell of the citrus body wash. It has a faint scent of oranges and is sweet. It doesn't dry out my skin as much as other soaps do. It makes mounds of lather, so a little goes a long way. The ingredients listed on the product page are incorrect; it does not contain lauryl or laureth sulfates."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I worked in cosmetic ingredient sales for several years meaning I sold the ingredients directly to large manufacturers and worked with the scientists.I learned much and try to share it.It's rare to find so many natural and beneficial ingrdients in a soap or face wash. This is a cleanser for oily skin according to the bottle front but it actually is surprisingly mild and non-drying. But the big bonus for me is the tea tree. This is a natural antiseptic and blemish cure yet having to dilute a bottle of it and then apply that mixture to skin isn't all that convenient. This does it for you so you not only have cleaner hands, but better skin on your face as well.How can it clean the skin with an antiseptic without drying it? It also contains olive oil, another great skin helper. So between the two you are cleaning, removing bacteria, as well as moisturizing.I have very sensitive skin and have had great results with this cleanser."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The first time I used Avalon's Vitamin C eye cream, my eyes began to sting so badly that I was uncomfortable for 24 hours.  I thought that maybe I had used too much, so I tried again several days later with only a tiny amount, being careful to keep it away from my lashes.  My eyes still became uncomfortable. This is the exact opposite of what an eye cream should do.  The whole point of eye cream is to be thick enough not to melt and get into your eyes and, if it does, it should not sting. That's why eye cream is different than face cream. This one fails. I won't be using it again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have used this product for years. I have a dermatological condition called keratosis pilaris which consists of small raised bumps that appear on one side of my forehead and on my arms. This rich cream is actually more effective in minimizing these bumps than the prescription lotion that I have used. I was extremely distressed to read that this company has been purchased by health food giant Hains and that other product formulas have been changed and are no longer effective for whatever they were supposed to do. When I purchased this bottle there was only one left and it is not a new product nor is it manufactured by Hains so I guess I was lucky. If this information is correct then I assume Amazon will be restocking another facial cream that is ineffective. Apart from my particular condition, this cream is a wonderful eye cream. It softens and smooths this area just as you should expect. Can't really recommend it if the formula is being manufactured by another company."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Aside from my standard Olay ORIGINAL moisturizer which I use faithfully every day -- this seems to be the ONLY other product that helps the &#34;vertical&#34; lines that are appearing on the top of my eyelids.  I'm 67 and have tried a lot of products - found most to be rather useless for the money except for the Olay ORIGINAL mositurizer which I have used all my life and now this.  Nice touch before bed as well.  Smell is faint but good.  Very creamy.  Use just a tiny dab -- and the pump is nice in that it only puts out a very small amount - just what you need for the small eye space -- so no waste of product.I have also tried the facial cream from Avalon Organics Vit C  - like it, but this Revitalizing Eye Creme is the one that makes a visible difference on my lines above my eye with repeated daily use."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm only 5 months pregnant but I have no stretchmarks (so far), no itchy belly, and it's kept dryness to a minimum in this cold weather. I use it once a day after the shower, all over. I've been using it since I was 3 months pregnant. I took off one star because it's a big oilier than I'd like, but I did try another (more expensive, lighter oil, mamma mio) product and I started seeing dryness, so I switched back to this Mother's Special Blend. The initial smell is nice (chocolately!) but it goes away in a few minutes."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I recently had a bad case of hives from an allergic reaction to a medicine.This product helped a lot in the short run, which was worth quite a bit. Cooling and soothing. However, I found that after a couple of applications over the course of half a day or so, the product buildup became an irritant in itself, and I had to shower and remove it, which I didn't necessarily feel well enough to want to do. I didn't have that problem with aloe vera gel.However, this product contains a mild local anesthetic, so it may be more helpful for some things. I didn't think of the aloe vera gel until the hives had improved somewhat, so it may not have compared as well in the beginning.I'd buy this again, but I sure hope I don't need to."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this mascara for years and it never disappoints. Adds lots of length and volume to my lashes. The first couple applications from a brand new tube are pretty thin and light, but it will thicken and give you the desired results thereafter. I used to go through these tubes so quickly because they would dry out pretty fast... until a trick I learned: if your tube starts drying out, extend its life by adding 2 drops of contact solution/eye drops to the tube. It will instantly rehydrate it for continued use. I've been using the same tube for 10 months now by doing this! :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "BEST mascara I've ever used.  I recently had been following the advice of some beauty bloggers and tried a couple other brands only to be disappointed by their clumping, or inability to give me long, beautiful looking lashes (mostly clumping - yuck).So I came back to my old favorite and it's just as good as ever.  This mascara goes on really well-- no clumping even if you slide the wand through your lashes a few times (for complete, awesome coverage).  It makes my eyes look great, doesn't smudge for me.  I have a friend who says she gets raccoon eyes from this-- so she uses their waterproof version and loves it.  So if you touch your eyes a lot or have allergies/watery eyes, maybe go waterproof.  I don't prefer waterproof because I like that this comes off easy with soap and water without need for a special makeup remover."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used to love Revlon's full n' soft mascara, so I decided to try this one.  Its just not the same.  If I'm not extreme careful my eyelashes become clumped.  My eyelashes are soft, but only because I used one coat.  If I put a coat this one and then use a different brush, my lashes look great, but I didn't want to have to use two brushes. Just not for me.  The good part is it washes off easily."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this based on the good reviews I read, and had confidence that it would live up to them. It didn't. This mascara smudges and smears very easily. It's allergy season, so my eyes tear a little... but just from that it streaked under my eyes! Other mascaras don't do this at all. The mascara goes on nicely and separates your lashes well, but I can't give it a three-star rating because I can't use it and had to throw it in the trash."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This has to be one of the best mascaras I have ever tried (and I've tried many!).  My lashes are both thin and short, and I've found that this mascara adds plenty of fullness AND a bit of length, too.  Plus, there are absolutely NO CLUMPS when I use this mascara; the unique brush deposits just the right amount of product on my lashes, unlike other products that claim to be \"clump-free.\"  I've tried both the regular and the waterproof versions of this mascara; I prefer the latter, as it stays on great yet washes off easily.  The only thing that I think could make this product better would be a curling brush to give the lashes a bit more lift.  Although Full 'N Soft isn't a dramatic mascara, it is perfect for everyday wear, and I would recommend highly to anyone."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "As far as drugstore mascaras go, I have loved Full N Soft for years. Drugstore mascara is inexpensive, so I have often experimented with other brands/formulas - Maybelline, Revlon, L'Oreal, etc., but Full N Soft is the one I come back to. It is great in a single coat and also builds well. If building, I recommend using a clean mascara brush to separate between coats. If during the day your lashes get bent (this happens to me with sun and prescription glasses), use your finger to apply pressure and curve lashes back in place. The flexible formula will re-mold. No flakes, no mess.The brownish-black is natural and minky-coloured. The super black is dramatically black!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This cream feels great and feels like it absorbs well. Unfortunately, it also seems to be slightly pore clogging since it causes small white heads.I also the had the tinted version of this cream and was not satisfied with it at all. It was too thick and did not spread well. The &#34;tint&#34; was more heavily colored than some of the foundations I have used in the past AND it just seemed to sit on top of the skin. As a result, the color would rub off in spot and look blotchy. In other words, it was terrible. This one is MUCH better, but it still doesn't cut it, really.If you want an AMAZING cream, see my review of the L'Oreal Ideal Moisture Even Tone cream. I really love it. http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4OWBH1VSBUF/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B00AYWN8OY"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one. It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft. I also love the way you just pump the top and the moisturizer comes out....you don't have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what's left in it. All creams and lotions and such should be this way...I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I've left any germs in the remaining cream. I recommend this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I hate it when my moisturizer slithers of my face like an oil slick, or is so thick you almost have to add water to spread it onto your face. Just one pump of this covers my face, neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute;. Makeup application is smooth, and seems to stay put longer than usual when I use this. I haven't noticed any major changes in the appearance of my fine lines, etcBut I do like he way my skin feels when I use this.  I'd order it again for sure."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried many different brands of moisturizer for my very sensitive skin and found this to be completely non-irritating and it moisturizes well. I don't know what \"anti-aging\" means. I wouldn't say that I look any younger as a result of using it. I like that the same amount comes out each time with one press on the pump--it helps prevent accidentally squirting out too much. And I sure wouldn't want to do that because this stuff costs a whole lot per ounce for those of us on a limited budget. The best deal around is to buy a two-pack on Amazon. That cost will beat a retail purchase by several dollars."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't know why they call this &#34;Plus Touch of Sun&#34; as I took that to mean it had self-tanner or bronzer in it - but it does nothing really for color. It's not a bad moisturizer at all- I just haven't found the 'touch of sun' in it. This may be because I tan easily and there isn't enough of a &#34;touch of Sun&#34;. In other words I find this no better than other moisturizers which don't promise as much as this one does but I still like it"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've only been using this moisturizer for a little over a week and I can already feel the difference in my skin.  My foundation goes on smoothly and my skin feels moisturized all day.  I have been using Aveeno for years but I like this moisturizer so much better.I work at a skilled nursing facility and the residents with the nicest skin ALL say that they've been using Oil of Olay for decades.  If that doesn't make you want to try it for yourself, I don't know what will."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First of all let me say that I have dry skin so I need something that is really going to help me with that and this just didn't do that for me. It didn't break me out or cause irritation but it didn't help with my problem areas either! I have large pores around my nose, chin and forhead, This didn't help tighten those. I have dry cheeks and oily in T-Zone and it didn't help with the dryness AT ALL. If you have perfect skin and you just need a face cream then this is for you. But as an Anti-Ager and all the other stuff it's supposed to do not so much. It didn't brighten my complexion or help even out my skin. So I went back to my Boots No 7 Regimen (See My Review) and I couldn't be happier."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried many different moisturizers.  I've been looking for something that helps with the fine lines, but doesn't make my face greasy or clog my pores.  I love this moisturizer!  It feels like velvet, absorbs quickly, and doesn't cause my face to break out.  The description says it's unscented, but it does have a very, very light fragrance.  It's not perfumey, just fresh and clean.  I'm on my second bottle and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Everything has a smell. When Aveeno says that it is fragrance free that means they did not add any external fragrances to the product which can be irritating to some people. This product smells like cooked plain oats when initially applied, but that will go away after it absorbs.Now that that's out of the way, the reason I rated this product 3 stars is because Aveeno seems to have changed its ingredients around from when I first bought this lotion. Oat Flour (Avena Sativa) use to be its FIRST(most abundant) ingredient. Now it's the 7th, and the first ingredient is water, which I think has caused this lotion to be less effective than it used to be for me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I liked that this was light and hydrating for my hands. As an artist, I work with a lot of mediums that require me to wash my hands afterward (i.e. paints, oil pastels), so one can imagine that my hands are prone to dryness. However, after two weeks of use, I got an allergic reaction from the lotion in the form of tiny, non-itchy bumps on the backs of my hands. I gave the rest to my friend who does like Aveeno, but I'll have to search for another hand lotion."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Love it............... it cleans skin wounderful, if u boil hot water on the stove.steam it, take a hot washcloth and let it soak for about 1 min, cool the cloth down it a lilcold water.. put the cloth on your face let it sit there for about 1 min to open your pores.take a lil bit of facial cleanser and rub it on your face, then rinse of with cold water... skin comes outlooking like milk.. wait about 2 mins then put your favorite moisturizer on your skin, head out the door.and start your day.. trus me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been wanting to purchase a body oil ever since I received one as a sample. I went to Target one day & unexpectedly found this with the rest of the Palmer's stuff. I didn't even know they had a body oil! I saw the price & quickly put it in my basket. This stuff works so well! Ever since using this after every shower my boyfriend now says all the time how soft my skin is ( he doesn't even know I use body oil!). 4 reasons you should purchase this: Palmer's doesn't test on animals, low price, smells so good, & it works!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product is not at all good for short hair.  The barrel is huge!  I know the description gives the 1-1/2\" measurement but nowhere does it say anything about hair length recommendations.  I have to wrap my hair around half the brush and hold it there with my hand (hot!) because it doesn't even begin to wrap enough to stay on there.  Slightly better luck with the curling iron attachment.  This will be a fine product if you have at least shoulder length hair.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.  Now I am hoping mine burns up so I can return it at Amazon's expense instead of mine."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "An item you can do without. Before i bought this i would sit covered over a bowl of hot water. The benefit to having this product is that you can turn on the steam as soon as you need it. Still takes like 5 min for it to actually start steaming. Once you have your face in the bowl mask you can feel a bit insecure because if that thing splashes water on you it will burn you. The battery operated exfoliating brush (included) is loud and cheap. I dont use any of these things as much i thought i would."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The first one arrived & the facial sauna worked fine, but the little facial scrubber didn't.  Amazon replaced the entire package and everything works fine.  Is it like going to the spa and getting a facial?  No.  But then I didn't pay as much for this little device as the spa paid for the one they use.  The steam isn't a lot, it's gentle.  I did put a towel over my head & that helped.  The sinus attachment works well.  I am pleased with the purchase."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I purchased this system at a \"Bed, Bath, and Beyond\" store. I used it, and I really did like the whole Facial Sauna System. However, not too long after using the system, problems did occur. The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down & eventually fell apart...And there's really no way to order a replacement. The other problem was that the actual Facial Tool eventually stopped working. I thought perhaps I needed to replace the batteries, although when I put new batteries in, it still did not work. So the only thing left that still works is the Facial Steamer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this steamer for the last 9 years.  My first lasted about 8 years, but got a little crusty by the end of it.  The timer option is great so  I don't have to keep track of time.  This one includes a convenient measuring cup.  I wasn't crazy about the exfoliation tool (prefer to use a combo of Cetaphil and baking soda), but I guess it does the job.  I use the steamer about 2x a week for blackheads."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using these for several years, and I try never to be without them. My face tends to get oily in the afternoons, and a quick dab all over with one of these completely takes care of it without disturbing my makeup.  I took off one star because they aren't quite as big as I would like.  If you're oily enough that you need to use the whole sheet, you end up having to hold it by a spot that is already used and then you have your face oil on your fingers.  If the sheets were a little bigger, that wouldn't be a problem.  Overall, though, one of my favorite products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used this during the day for a couple months in conjunction with the Q10 night cream and it seemed to help soften the wrinkles I had started to notice.  Doesn't aggravate my acne prone skin and I like this lotion better than the night cream since the consistency is light and absorbs well and the smell is very minimal (plain suntan/lotion smell).  Works fine under my makeup.  Would be great if they offered it with a slightly higher spf to last just a bit longer (since I don't reapply over my makeup)."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The good thing about this product is that it contains a pretty good antioxidant.  The packaging, a pump as opposed to an open jar, makes it so the product isn't exposed to oxygen, so the antioxidents don't break down and oxidize.  The product isn't too greasy either, and I have cobination to oily skin.Now my gripe with the product is that because it contains SPF 15, this will lull many consumers into thinking they are covered for sun protection.  Unfortunately, it's not broad spectrum protection.  This product doesn't contain titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, avobenzone, or one of many other ingredients that protect against UVA rays.  UVA rays cause skin cancer.  Many moisturizer with SPF do not contain broad spectrum protection, so make sure to check the labels.Bottom line: This is a good, light moisturizer for sensitive skin.  Just be sure to use a full spectrum sunscreen along with the moisturizer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this lotion for quite some time - probably about 9 months now, and I absolutely love it. It's lightweight and oil free and it makes a great base under foundation too. I love that it contains SPF too. A nice feature this product has is that it doesn't leave that whitened look on your skin after application as a lot of lotions with sunscreen do. As far as the wrinkle prevention Q10 is concerned I haven't noticed any lessening of my lines of my face, but I also haven't noticed any new ones either so maybe it's preventing new wrinkles? Anyhow, this is a very nice lightweight SPF that feels nice on your face and won't break you out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This curling iron is pretty good, but it does not have a strong enough spring to keep hair in place when curling. I have learned to correct this by hair-spraying the strands of hair I am about to curl. Then I clamp the hair under the metal clip about an inch or two up from the end of the strand. If you try to clamp your hair at the tip--it will not hold. You have to start an inch or two up from the edge to get it to hold. But if you do that, and if you hair spray it first--this curler can make some excellent spirals. I give this item 4 stars because it was basically the cheapest ringlet curler I could find. And this product does give me the curl I want, it just takes a little bit of finesse. But if you want something stronger and easier to use, look elsewhere."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Anything I every purchase by revlon was cheap and works great as high pricey products. Packaging was great as if it was just light books were inside and delivery was perfect timing for me.  If you haven't tried anything by revlon then I really recommend all there products and purchasing them from this seller when needed to. It's really worth every cent you worked for and heats up in seconds when your on the go. I really have to complete the whole entire set by getting the other size barrels by revlon that works wonders on any type of hair.Thanks!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This may be great for some people but the information listed neglects to tell you that this is a flat barrel 1/2 inch iron which is suppose to give ribbon like curls. Although the package says ribbon curl I didnt realize the barrel was going to be flat and I was a little disappointed when I got it. That's the only downside, everything else like the settings, heat, and tangle free cord all work great and shipping was fast. So if your into ribbon looking curls then this iron would be for you otherwise keep looking."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this scrub (sensitive skin, original, and the acne varieties) for over 10 years now.  It's a great basic scrub that is inexpensive.  I use it every morning in the shower and my makeup goes on a lot more evenly once I've exfoliated with it.  My best friend tried it out when she stayed over my place and has been using it ever since as well.  Even my boyfriend loves it and says that it prevents ingrown hairs on his face and neck from shaving.  This is a great scrub and I'm going to keep buying it as long as St. Ives is making it.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Okay, so I'm a guy... but yes, once a week I scrub my face with St Ives Swiss Formula Apricot Scrub.  I have gone through this ritual for about 20 years now.  I'm not crazy about the new scent, but this brand name item is the best out there.  (I've used the generic).  I'm 45 years old while writing this review... but I look at least 10 years younger.  Is it because of St Ives or is it genetic?  I'll never know... but I'm going to continue to use this product until I die.  Keeps my face smooth (makes it easier to shave with an electric) and keeps my pores open.  That's about all I ever wanted to use this for and I believe it serves it's purpose."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm a cashier at Rite aid, and this guy came to my check stand and bought 2 of the Eucerin Q10 cremes. I asked him if it worked well, and his answer was pretty much \"it's amazing and only rite aid sells it!\"So since it was buy one get the second one 50 % off I decided to get the Q10 and the night creme.I get very dry skin, def when the whether is cold. It gets peely and red and it's awful to deal with. Also, I tend to break out with this whether. I opened the container and I was happy that is was truly fragrance free (my skin will break out with fragrances). The yellow color is from all the natural ingredients, it's not bad at all. It's a thicker cream, but when I apply it in the morning I can put make up over it and work all day and everything is good! My dry, red skin is gone too. This creme is amazing. :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Used for about 2 months.  Did seem to help soften the wrinkles that I had started to notice.  Product absorbs quite well and isn't overly greasy although consistency is rather thick.  I have acne prone skin and dry skin areas and while it did not aggravate my acne it didn't really help the dry areas either (surprising considering the consistency).  I hate strong perfume-y night cream on my face when I'm trying to sleep (which is one of the reasons I don't care for olay products) and this product could pass exactly for a tub of margarine or butter for color, smell, and texture.  It was better than perfume but I didn't exactly love it, either."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a lot like the Nivea Visage Q10 that stopped coming to the US and you can buy online still (made by the same company, Beiersdorf, in their factory in Poland). It's impressively cheap, it moisturizes really well, you can use it morning or night, it has no fragrance or dye, so you can use it around your eyes without them getting red or swollen.Negatives - it doesn't have the immediate effectiveness that retinol products do, then again you can't use those during the day. Also, an sunscnreen would make this more useful. I'm not a fan of using many different lotions, so I'm unlikely to buy this again, as it's neither an ideal night nor day lotion, even if it is a great value and a solid product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Better late than never! This cream is amazing, it's rich without being super greasy and has vitamins (A, C, E), no oils, no parabens, fragrance free it's very gentle yet effective. I love it and its now a staple for me. I don't know why Eucerin dosent advertise this face cream especally since it has vitamin C and E which is all the rage in anti-aging face products.My only gripe is that it needs to be in a tube not a jar because of the vitamins.Ingrediants: Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotine, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First off, I do have slightly oily skin, so people with normal or dry skin would probably have a better time with this product.I got this pretty cheap, so for the price I can't complain much. I wanted to try it and now I have, and for me at least, it was just 'okay'.I found the cream a little too thick, and it felt a little greasy after use. It was okay for using at night, but I want a cream I can use before I put my makeup on too.However, I will say that it is indeed good for sensitive skin. I never experienced any redness or itchiness like with some products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Just the scent and lotion I've been looking for. Ecco Bella Vanilla is amazingly creamy and luxurious. It's gourmet lotion! I absolutely love the feel of it on my skin. It's not greasy yet it delivers fabulous moisture to dry skin. The vanilla smells heavenly. It's subtle and natural but you won't be able to stop smelling your own arms because the scent is SO intoxicating. It DOES NOT leave you smelling like a cupcake. It's a sexy vanilla scent. I will purchase more before this runs completely out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I suffer from dry hands... My own fault - I hate to wear rubber gloves when I do things. This lotion is a saver. It has NO water whatsoever and all the good stuff. So, a good sugar scrub and an application of this later, my hands look like I've never done any housework in my life. Highly recommended. I know it's a body lotion, but the rest of me is not dry enough to waste this on... It is rich, so if your legs are dry from shaving, it will probably save them too."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love this so much!This mask is everything I was looking for: thick, not too pungent, great ingredients, and best of all, IT WORKS!I use this mask whenever I've had a long day and I know the oil/dirt buildup on my skin is a lot or if I fell asleep the night before and was too lazy and tired to wash my face.You simply apply it, let it dry, rinse, then continue to wash your face with you normal cleanse.I paired this mask along with the Freeman Pineapple Enzyme mask (which smells amazing might I add!) and with my normal Neutrogena cleanser/toner and together they have brought my skin (which was blemished and damaged) back to life.I truly love this and recommend this to anyone whose skin easily gets oily just like mine."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "i went to the drugstore looking for queen helene's mint julep mask, but i couldn't find it, so i picked this up instead. i really like this mask as well, it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it's very easy to rinse off. i have sensitive skin and i haven't had any breakouts or adverse reactions to it after using it. the only things i don't like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them, and it's a little itchy when it dries."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I saw this clay mask at CVS and it had a rebate thing stating \"Try For Free\".  I gave it a try because I love free products.  This thing is actually good.  I have watched Youtube and saw reviews here that say this thing is wonderful.  I might have to agree with everyone.  It applies like a regular mask and after a few minutes, it dries up and you wash it off and voila, you'll feel great afterwards.  I took off one star because this mask does have a strong smell that even for a non-sensitive person like me, I would like for the manufacturer to chill with the scent.  It's a strong smell of baby powder with a tinge of hair perm??  Some of you guys might disagree but personally, that's what comes to mind when I apply it  on my face.  Overall it's not bad of a product because I do feel my face being cleaner after use."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This avocado & oatmeal masque is super cheap and I know some people complain about the ingredients. People! You get what you pay, if you want something better, pay extra to get something fancy to suit your needs. This tube is big enough so this should last me longer than 6 months really since I use it maybe once a week.I like how this helped me a little with reducing the size of pores. My face feels fresh and tight after I use this. My only complains are that whenever I apply this on my face, it stings my eyes so much although I did not apply it close around the eyes either, just around cheek area. Overall, I like it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I absolutely love this face mask, its the best one i have used.It evens out my skin, soothes it and makes my skin feel clean and feel really nice. I use this product once and a while and do spot treatment on places where i am prone to get breakouts (i touch my face a lot on my chin and i use this to wash this area to prevent breakouts)I have been using this product for years now, and I still haven't run out. I dont use it too often but when i do its really nice and refreshing for my skin. its lasted so long that my bottle isn't updated to this photo, but its the same ingredients. I will be re purchasing this product as im almost finally running out. I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Even though I am pushing 50, and my skin is pretty dry, I still keep this clay masque on hand. Why? Because I have large pores that are getting (ack!) even bigger as I age. With one use, I can see my pores visibly reduced. With two I'm almost back to \"Pores? What pores?\" This stuff is super cheap, you get a lot for your money and it works.General 411: I usually put this all over my face (except eyes and mouth, of course),leave it on 20-ish minutes to let it dry. Rinse with a wash cloth then follow with a good moisturizer on my drier bits. The next day I exfoliate really well to get rid of any dry skin flakes. After this 1-2 procedure, I look like I've had a professional facial!Unfortunately, there's no way to \"cure\" large pores, but this masque certainly helps keep them in check."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I use the Freeman Cucumber Facial Mask religiously, once a week, followed by Queen Helene's Mint Julep mud mask. After exfoliating I apply this mask for fifteen minutes - it's kind of fun marching around the house looking like a burn victim (the mask goes on clear and shiny, and dries clear and shiny) - before peeling it off and applying the mud mask for fifteen minutes. The mud mask is excellent for standing in clear view by your front window as the neighbor mows his lawn or answering the door for the FedEx guy so you can sign for a package. It's such a conversation starter.Anyhow, after moisturizing my skin is good to go for the week, and it's consistently clear and fresh thanks to this mask."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I really like this product, it is my go-to peel off mask. All of Freeman's products are amazing, and this one is no different. It smells just like cucumbers, and it is not difficult to remove at all. It's kind of a thicker consistency so its a little hard to spread onto your skin but its not an impossible task. I just removed it from my face about ten minutes ago and it feels fresh and clean. I recommend this to anyone looking for a peel-off mask, and if you're just shopping for masks in general, I recommend any of the Freeman products, especially this one, the lemon and mint clay mask, and the anti-stress dead sea minerals mask."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "this one happens to be my least favorite. it has an extremely pungent alcohol smell to the point that it will have your eyes watering. applying it to the skin is like applying very, very thick honey. on the plus side, it is EXTREMELY cooling and invigorating as it is drying. i also enjoy peeling it off and find that the majority of it does come off in one piece, but some glue-like remnants sometimes get stuck to my eyebrows and that is not fun to scrape off. i most likely will not be buying this product again. i recommend sticking to the clay masks that freeman has to offer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If you are looking for a peeling mask this one is pretty good.  It dries fast and you can get a good peel with it - all in one sheet. It seems to help to control my sons acne a little.I made the mistake of after the mask, using a blackhead tool and clearing out anything that came to the surface --- well everything came out easily but he was left with a face full of red marks and scabs for like a week, so I felt terrible. It draws everything to the surface and leaves the skin extra soft and sensitive and more easy to tear and damage.So I'd recommend just using the mask - and not picking after! I've used it several times without picking and it's been fine."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is a fun product to buy and it actually works well. If you are going to use this I would suggest applying the product liberally so that you do not have a thin layer but a nice thick one. I also suggest leaving this product on for longer than 10 minutes, maybe around 15 so that it really gets to dry. Before you apply the product pull back your hair because it can get a little annoying when the product gets stuck to your hair. I would also be mindful not to get any on your eyebrows cause it can get inbetween the little hairs.Once you remove the mask you'll find that your skin is nice and soft and less oily. It does remove dead skin but do not anticipate removal of blackheads. It also leaves you with a nice soothing/cooling sensation afterwards."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "One of my favorite peel-off masks. A treat for my face. Exfoliates/peels and leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft. It's gentle on skin but cleans effectively.  The cucumber mask feels great in the hot summer months for deep cleaning and leaves my face feeling refreshed and renewed.  Dries fairly quickly and peels easily.  I use a cucumber toner after peeling off and my skin feels calmed and soothed. I have better results with moisturizing when I use this peel a couple times per week."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "First of all, it does pull out stuff from your pores, bet very little bit. Just to explain: if you use strips on your nose (I think most of the girls know what strips I talk about), then you pull it out, you see some pore stuff left on the strip, but most of pores still not cleaned. So this mask working much less than strips for nose. It takes some stuff out, but its nothing, doesn't make sense to use.I couldn't find some good pore cleaner, until I try proactiv. Even if you have no pimples, try to buy just a cleanser from proactiv (the first one from regular kit), it's like a scrub, but it's first scrub in my life that really clean pores instead of scratching skin. So, put the scrab on DRY face, scrab it all for minute, especially your nose. After 2-3 use your pores will be clean. I promise."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Cucumber cool facial that is just what I wanted. My favorite was discontinued years ago and the Freeman brand isn't one I was familiar with until Amazon. Use a thin layer for best results . . . drying time is 10 min. or less. Soothing for sensitive and mature skin. Can be used daily. Product information and description is accurate. It does feel a bit sticky so just rinse your hands and remember that a thin layer accomplishes the desired results. The tube makes it easy to use and store.Consider the other peel masks offered by Freeman . . . Pomegranate is another good choice from this line of products.Definitely recommended!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This won't take off blackheads or renew your skin overnight, but for what you pay for its ok. It does make my skin softer, reduce some redness, and has a calming smell. I mainly use this with my younger sisters when I visit from College. It breaks a bit when you peel unless you are very slow about it. When applying to your face you might want to make sure you have water on the side to start washing your hands off, its very sticky and needs a bit of soap to get off! Imagine applying it then turning the water on, you'll get the handle nasty. If that happens just wait to peel it off when it dries, but kinda annoying if you have OCD!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I just brought this product yesterday at Walgreens for $4.29 and I love it. It smells great, it's a little sticky but it works. When I opened the top I wasn't expecting a clear gel like substance, I was a little hesitant at first but I followed the directions. It will dry fast so smooth it over your face fast and wait about 20 minutes and peel it off and then wash your face. 5-10 minutes is not long enough in my opinion and make sure to not put it on your eyebrows or sideburns because when your peeling it off it will be very hard to get it off your hair. If you do run into this problem do not panic just simply wash it off your face with warm water. Your face will be left feeling smooth and smelling great. The bumps on my face are smaller but not as noticeable but I will continue to use this product."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This really is a good hair dryer, it gets very hot which I love and dries the hair quickly.  I have long hair and it didn't take me long at all to dry it.  The dryer itself is pretty heavy but that was not a problem for me, to others it may be though.  The reason I gave this product a 3 is because I bought it on Sept 4 2010 and finally just had to replace it about 2 months ago because it started to make the most god awful noise when I would use it, I can only describe the noise as slowly murdering a cat behind the engine of a plane.  I do like conair products and it was definitely a good dryer and lasted me for quite a while."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This Conair Ionic was purchased after my other hair dryer fell into the pool.  Don't ask.Anyway, thinking the ionic part was just a gimmick but still hoping it was for real,  I got this.  It's a pretty thing, and on the small side which I like.I actually DID see a big improvement in the shine of my hair from using this!  My hair has more body bounce and shine, and just looks much healthier.  This seems to be less hot on the highest setting, and it takes a slightly longer time to dry my hair with this but I don't mind a bit because whatever \"ionic\" means, it works.  I am extremely pleased with this.  I don't find this any heavier than other hairdryers, as some reviews stated.I highly recommend this dryer.  My hair loves this.  Finally a hair dryer that seems to improve the condition of my hair instead of damaging it.  I'm so happy I got this!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "There are plenty of reviews here on the performance of this dryer, which I think is fine, but I wanted to comment on it being a \"quiet\" dryer.  It \"is\" quieter than most, but my previous Conair Ionic hair dryer was 80 decibels on high, and this one is 90 decibels on high.  Anything over 80 decibels can damage your hearing, so I'm a bit disappointed in this, but again, it's still quieter than most hair dryers... but I would have thought the \"newer\" dryer would have been even more quiet."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have long wavy hair and I bought this because it came with a diffuser attachment. It clicks in no problem (as well as the concentrator but I've only used it once) and you can easily take it off. The cord is longer so if you have a larger bathroom, it helps. It also has a hook on the base of the handle, you can kind of see it in the picture, which helps with storage if you choose to hang it up. I use it on the hot heat, low setting and I don't see a lot of frizz even without product. It dries my hair quickly without it being noisy. But if you use it on the high setting, it gets noisy. Overall, I love this dryer. So far. I'll post another review if anything bad happens to the dryer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I thought this was a more powerful dryer...my bad. I'm going to keep it since I like the color (LOL) and it dries well  with a high and low setting and 2 speeds, and has concentrator and attachment for curls. Both attachments are very tough to take off...I'm so afraid I'll break one of them....they need a better system to get them on and off. The dryer is only 1275 watts, not exactly powerful. And, very important, the buttons for high/low/off/ and heat settings are very small, and placed badly. I keep accidentally turning off the blower!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This dryer doesn't blow hard or hot enough to straighten the waves out of my hair without a lot of extra styling, which is time-consuming. I have pretty fine, thin hair, so I think this dryer should only be good for people with very straight hair that only want to dry it, not style it. I tried using a styling brush, but the style didn't hold due to the air from the dryer being too cool. I had to use a curling iron. It does leave my hair soft and fluffy, but I wouldn't buy another one."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "With below the shoulder hair, I found this to dry it quickly and without burning.  I have fine, thick hair so usually it takes 10 minutes or more to dry ... and other dryers run so hot that they burn if focused in one spot for more than a moment (to set a wave, for instance).  This gets just hot enough to be safe and pleasant to use.The finger-attachment might be useful if someone else is styling your hair, but my arms (I'm 5'9\") aren't long enough to make its use practicable.Two speeds, two heat settings (plus cold-shot button) actually give a very usable range for drying efficiently.  Took me less time than with my previous dryer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This blow dryer is a little on the heavy side, and the sound isn't exactly quiet either. BUT, like most people said, I do feel a difference in the way my hair looks and feels when I use this one compared to other regular dryers. My hair tends to be dry to begin with, so maybe that's why i notice the change. But if you already have smooth hair, I wouldn't know how the product performs. Another plus is that it dries my hair quickly...takes about 1/2 the time I usually need."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Wow, never thought I would purchase anything else but Origins and this product proved me otherwise.  So far it has moisturized my face very well during the day (I have dry skin and sometimes flaky on my forehead, chin area and lightly on my cheeks during the winter season in the east coast).  You would have to try it since everyone's face will respond to it differently and depending on what season and where you are residing will also make a difference.  This is my first time being in the east coast during the winter season so my face is a lot more dehydrated (it has not yet acclimated to the east coast winter weather, if it will ever be) in any case this product has done it's job and I have been very happy of it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using this for about 2 weeks now. I got this product hoping it would be a huge turn around for my overly dry skin. And while sadly my skin is still dry, it is less harsh than regular body washes out there and leaves me feeling very moisturized after a shower. However, the relief only seems to last mere minutes. I'm still having to use lotion all over my body on a daily basis. Maybe my results will change with the season as right now its winter and the air is fairly dry, but I'm not so sure.  The smell isn't horrible, but its also not great. And when I received the package body wash had leaked all per inside the box and all over the bottle. That Was something I was most definitely not happy with. I will probably, however, continue to use the product as organic stuff is still healthier for your skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The smell is fantastic but I wished it was stronger and lasted longer; though maybe this would be good for someone who wants scented body wash but who are sensitive to overpowering scents. My husband even loves the smell. I was happy that there is a good amount of lather since most shampoos that are sulfate free do not have any lather. I even used it as a shampoo and it did not dry my hair out at all! I have since tried the tropical scent of this body wash and I prefer it more over the honey mango."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It says that you should see results in 2 weeks. Well, I didn't, but I guess we all have different skin. I could start seeing results within the first month (right cheek & forehead). It truly works.Make sure you use it with a sunscreen though. Fade creams can potentially damage skin when the profuct is on and the skin is exposed to sunlight.Along with the fade cream, I used Alba's Skin Lotion w/h SPF 15 as well as Palmer's Cocoa Butter Lotion during the night. On nights were it got really cold, I used Bio Oil on my face with the fade cream underneath.Will definitely buy a second bottle (well, jar) soon."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've already have this product and ordered it in January. I decided to come online and write about how well its working and I plan to order more soon! I am a dark skinned african american women and have had discoloration on my face for years until I began to use this product. I only use this product, suncreen, along with carbolic soap and have seen a DRASTIC improvement. I was scared this would burn my skin or make me itch because I suffer from eczema and tend to have sensitive skin but no problems whatsoever! :)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I couldn't wait to get this eye pillow. I read the reviews and was hoping that the scent wasn't too overpowering. Well it came last night, I opened the box expecting a beautiful scent of lavender and I can BARELY smell the scent. I don't know if I just received one that was older or what, but when I used it last night the lavender was so faint that even holding it up to my nose didn't work. I love the fabric and it's very well made, just doesn't smell...is there something you can do?"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "ok so first of all it has a VERY Strong odor. its not going to fade so don't worry about that.  when I first got it the smell was actually a little overwhelming but it has calmed down a little over the months.  this is a great product to relax with, this is not a good product to try to sleep with as it slides all over the place.  I am sure some people who sleep on their backs would love this but I sleep on my side so I am constantly doing a balancing act with it until I fall asleep.  For headaches or just general relaxation when you are laying on your back I highly advise!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Suave is value for the money.  It's not watered down like some other inexpensive brands.  Thick and rich, smooth and silky.  I just love how my hand just glides over my skin in the shower, like I had just buttered myself all up!  It's the same sensation as showering in very soft water -- only I live in an area with nothing but hard water.  I feel clean and moisturized when I'm done.  I've always been a fan of Suave products and this one just reaffirms my loyalty."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "YUCK! I am really starting to think many of these rave reviews are fake, because go on over to Makeupalley and everyone else hates this product as well. I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product, until this one. It was literally unusable. It made my face look muddy, not natural at all. And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face, even though I didn't use that much! It just looked so bad, I didn't feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all. Buy at your own risk"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting Tinted Moisture, Sheer Tint, SPF 30, which is currently out of stock on AMAZON.  I decided to try the Healthy Defense product instead.I am 57 years old and although I like this product I do prefer the Ageless Intensives because I feel like it hydrates my skin better than the Healthy Defense.  This product goes on a little thicker and doesn't feel as light on my skin.I have found that if I am working outside for several hours, I still need a sunscreen product under this one.  It does not seem to be as effective in blocking the sun as I would expect for an SPF 30.All in all, this is an acceptable sub until the Ageless product becomes available.  If you have younger skin or do not spend hours outside this may be the perfect product for you."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used to use liquid foundation when I was younger and my pores were much smaller.  Now that I am in my 40's I find that liquid foundation doesn't apply well and leaves my face looking flaky.  This product is perfect to use in place of liquid, applies evenly and covers blemishes well.  It can be applied throughout the day to reduce shininess and doesn't cake or build up.  This is the only product I use unless I am going for a more dramatic look, in which case I use a silicone primer and liquid but, even then I apply this on top of the liquid with a brush to reduce shine"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the best foundation I have ever used.  It is easy to apply, completely covers and evens the skin tone, and stays on all day without clumping up.  Like the other reviewers, I appreciate that it dries matte.  I tried it because I have lupus and live at a high altitude, so I need extra UV protection.  So far so good.  The ability to lighten and darken the tone is great, although I do wish there were a way to add cooler/pink tones, since it is a tad yellowish.  That being said, I get lots of compliments about my skin when I wear this and, hey, I feel pretty!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This sunblock provides great physical sun protection.  It is good for people who have normal or combination to oily skin.  It feels a little heavy on your face but not as gross or greasy as regular sunblock or sunscreen.  It actually provides decent coverage and evens out your skin tone quite nicely.  The concept of being able to adjust the color of the foundation is pretty cool.  I wish cosmetic companies would provide regular foundations with this concept.  The color is pretty neutral, neither warm nor cool toned.  I could see, however, that on darker skin tones it could possibly be a little ashy due to the mineral sunblock content."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have trouble with sunscreen causing breakouts and this almost never causes blemishes.  I also have come to hate the smell of typical sunscreen and this doesn't have that smell.  I have light to medium tone Caucasian skin with some yellow undertones and this is so thick it can double as foundation makeup.  It says it dries clear, but it's a little chalky and would probably really look bad if you have dark or ethnic skin.  I have read that the tinted kind doesn't blend well with Asian skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is by far the best sun block I have ever used.  It goes on well and does the job it says it will, totally blocks the sun.  I used it in Florida recently and never burned and I have skin that burns within 20 to 30 minutes of strong sunlight.  Also this did not cause any irritation to my super sensitive skin.  I use in whenever I see that we are having a sunny day as UV rays penetrate car windows.  The key to using this product is to put it on about 20 to 30 minutes before going out and to reapply every three hours or so."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I started using this product about 4-5 months ago and I must say, I love this scrub! Its better than most scrubs I've used. Its gentle on skin, beads are very fine and it doesnt irritate my skin, smells heavenly and best of all, it doesn't make my skin break out nor makes it more oily. I've always had acne and had mild to moderate amount of acne scars on my face as well, with daily use for several months, I've started to notice that the scars are fading away, not completely gone but much less visible than before. Will definitely repurchase this! Also, price is great and a lasts a good while."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This stuff isn't very moisturizing at all. It has SPF 30 which automatically makes it thicker, plus the tint, this is just as moisterizing as foundation. I don't use foundation so I like that this is a very light foundation substitute, and that's what I would call it, not a moisterizer. I mix mine with grapeseed or emu oil so that it goes on slick and not cakey. When combined with my facial oil, I love the stuff..... But by itself? No good.Also I have moderate acne which I try VERY hard to keep under control, and this product does NOT make me break out."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used Aveeno for years but switched to Elta MD over two years ago and have not looked back:Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 provides higher spf protection and goes on smoother with a cleaner finish.  Elta MD is much better for combination or acne prone skin than Aveeno.  Elta MD does a FANTASTIC job of calming the excess redness in my complexion, something Aveeno has no effect on.  I also love how Elta MD goes on much lighter than Aveeno and Elta MD lasts longer as a result.  Elta MD is more expensive than Aveeno but I found myself going through an Aveeno every 2 months and a container of Elta MD lasts me over 4 months, so net net you are spending about the same or less with Elta MD over time.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love these. Minus one star because they are almost either too large, or too soapy. I cut them in half because I feel like I am wasting product at the end because their is a lot left in the pad. The cleanser is very gentle, and I really like the exfoliating side of the pad. Very useful for when I am in a hurry and don't have time to do my whole skin care routine. I also like to use them in the morning if I need a quick cleanse or if I wake up and my face is a little oily."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "STAY AWAY FROM IT IF YOU WEAR CONTACTS AND HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. I put this on my face and it felt alright for the first hour. I noticed my eyes started getting irritated and a rash on my forehead. My eyes looks stressed and was red. I didn't put this on the next day and my eyes felt way better and no rash. However my face is red from the irritation from this sunscreen. This product seems like the perfect choice for me:A daily moisturizer that has clinically proven Total Soy Complex and natural light diffusers that work to naturally even out skin toneGentle enough for sensitive skin and daily useOil freeHypoallergenicNoncomedogenic(won't clog pores)but the result turned out to be a bad product for me...I wish I could get my money back. If you wear contacts do not buy this. This product has a very heavy scent that will irritate your eyes and you will be desperate to take your contacts off....."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I cannot use liquid foundation. I have tried tons of different products and everything I use, no matter how light, turn orange on my skin after a very short time. I decided to try tinted moisturizer and this seems to blend like I was hoping it would. This is not for someone who needs a lot of coverage. I have normal skin and I don't get acne very often so I don't need anything full coverage. I tried this and for the first 2 days I used it it seemed to blend well, I would still wipe some off after I went out into the sunlight, but I didn't have to remove all of it. This morning I put it on and it wasn't even on my skin for 5 minutes and I looked like I was turning into an oompa loompa. No matter how much I tried to blend it around my skin. Maybe I am destined to never wear liquid makeup. :("}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have sensitive skin and a history of melanoma so I require a high spf.  I chose this product because my old product was discontinued, Aveeno has typically been very gentle and this one offered a 30 spf, which I need.It smells like sunscreen.  It went on easily but after a few minutes, it feels like it's kind of caked on.  Like a layer on top of my skin.  After a few hours, my skin felt very dried out as if I hadn't put a moisturizer on at all.  Three days into using it, I got two huge under the skin pimples that left marks on my face for over week."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is one of the better acne products out there. I use it almost everyday to gently exfoliate and clean my skin. Some people, like my brother, prefer the large beads in a facial scrub, but I like the smaller beads in this one. Because the beads are finer, it feels like it's exfoliating more evenly. It can also be used in combination with other products, where as other facial scrubs might be too harsh for combination with anything else in the day. I would recommend trying it out; It's effective, cheap, and the tube lasts for a really long time."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this product for about 2 years, but after running out and having to borrow my sister's (Eucerin Everyday Protection/SPF 30) for a week or so, my breakouts all but disappeared! I didn't change anything else in my routine or lifestyle habits - it had to be this moisturizer making me break out. If you look closely in the mirror after applying, you'll notice little glitter flecks. In my opinion, it's completely unnecessary and just contributing to the amount of crap available to clog pores! It has a tendency to leave my skin still thirsty for moisture too, also contributing to breakouts. Overall, it's ok, but after trying another product (that's also less expensive!), I found this wasn't what I assumed was as good at it got."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I looked in the mirror and saw glitter on my face, I was sad and thought my eyeshadow wasnt so great and was coming off. Then I noticed that the glitter was also on my palms... its this moisturizer, I suppose the natural light reflector... are like mirrors / glitter, Im actually wondering if it is seashell as that pops up in lotions sometimes, this is one reason I dont like the moisturizer so much... I'll only be wearing this on my upper lip, as soy is suppose to minimize hairs... and Ill see how that goes... Id wear this at the beach, or going to a night club... it does make skin feel soft, but Im not a total fan of the texture, beats olay though, but I think ill be going back to neutrogena."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If by positively radiant, Aveeno means shininess, then this is the product for you. I love Aveeno products, but this one isn't it. I have some light acne scars and I heard this was a good way to cover it up (BB creams, tinted moisturizers, etc.).When I first applied the product, it really burned and felt like a sunburn for a good 30 minutes. Then, I waited for it to dry and not look as shiny but it pretty much glimmered on my skin for the rest of the night. The color was marked fair to light, yet it was rather orange. Overall, I'm disappointed in the results. I'll stick to my Maybelline concealer for now."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I work full time and go to school at night so I was looking for a product that I could throw on in a hurry that was able to stand in place of make up. I have combination skin so a moisturizer was just what I was looking for. At first I LOVED this product! It covered quiet well and was very moisturizing. However, I only wore it for 4-5 hours at a time while I was in class. I later tried it on a weekend and noticed I had some minor break outs. The more I used it the more I broke out. Then I noticed there is SHIMMER in it! If you have acne shimmer will accentuate your break outs. Awful!Pros:Coverage; Not quite as good as make up but able to stand inSmell; VERY light smell of sun tan lotion, other than that unscentedFeel; It goes on pretty thick but absorbs into the skin well so you don't feel too greasy.

Unless you really need a higher SPF, you'll probably like the feel of the SPF 15 better. This one seems greasy. I have combination skin, but even when I dried out this winter I didn't care much for the texture of it. The extra grease didn't seem to help my dry skin problem either! It just made me shiny lol. I still use this (just to finish the bottle), but only mixed with make up.I haven't tried the tinted version of this moisturize because they don't make it in brown *ahem!*. :-)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm a 29 year old active male with moderately oily skin and I generally like this product.  The exfoliation is more gentle than most \"scrubs\" due to the very tiny beads.  It almost feels like you are rubbing fine grit sand on your face.  The actual cleansing portion is fairly gentle and smells nice.  Just a little dab of this will easily cover your face and I find one bottle lasting me over a month.One thing I will note is that this tends to be a tad harsh for normal skin - especially during the winter months.  I like to mix usage of this withAveeno Smart Essentials Scrub, since the latter is a little more gentle on the skin for when you don't need much exfoliation."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I absolutely love this product!  Finally, a tinted moisturizer that actually has some coverage to it.  I would definitely say this falls more into the BB cream category without all of the marketing gimmicks.  I use this as my daily makeup, use some color correcting concealer if needed, and set with a translucent powder.  I love that it is actually light enough for me, but be aware that there is nothing medium about this product, unless you are in the middle of the fair skin tones.  I love that the product helps even out skin tone & has SPF 30.  This product is 14.99 at my local Target so be sure to price compare!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Bought this today at Publix (our local grocery) on clearance for $8.00.  I really didnt need a sunscreen, just a tinted moisturizer as I dont like to wear foundation in Fla. in the hot humid season.  I read the other reviews and (1) The texture is due to the spf30 and quickly absorbs into the skin.  (2) Dont buy this if you have very dry skin as it is a lighweight moisturizer.  The fair to light works fine for me."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "PROS- I LOVE the way this makes my skin look! It has light reflectors that highlight parts of my face and gives my skin this gorgeous sheen.- SPF- Skin looks more even after continuous use.*CONS- *Unfortunately, it clogs my pores and causes me to break out if I leave it on all day; on the other hand, if I wash it off immediately when I get home after a few hours, my skin looks better.- Not water resistant. It will &#34;melt&#34; when it comes in contact with water.I've recently started trying to use more natural, eco-friendly products. Aveeno Positively Radiant Tinted Moisturizer isn't 100% natural and I believe it has an EWG rating of 3 with limited information from Aveeno. Although it seems to clog my pores and melts when it comes in contact with water, I REALLY like the way it looks. I use it when I know that I won't be out all day, that I won't be around water and I want to look fresh."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I don't like heavy foundations, at all. I've been trying to stick strictly to bare minerals, but in the desert heat that I live in it's impossible for the minerals to stick to my dry skin. This moisturizer is the perfect remedy! The coverage isn't total, but that's what I love most about it! It minimizes flaws so you don't look like you're trying too hard, it really makes your skin look natural. The light reflectors are nice too because they give my skin that youthful dewy look. I tone it down a bit with my bare minerals powder, but it's nice to feel like your skin looks healthy, and that's exactly what this product does.Also, I never felt that this moisturizer was too thick. One pump gave me total coverage and spread really easily. They only had medium in my store, and I have fair skin, but I still found it to blend really well with my skin color. I love, Love, LOVE this product!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this because I love the Aveeno Positively Radiant (non-tinted) moisturizer that is SPF 15 and now that winter is here, my pale skin needs some color. I also use the Jergens Natural Glow facial moisturizer, but it just doesn't keep my makeup in place throughout the day like Aveeno does. So, I bought this product thinking it was more like a gradual tanner. At first I was taken aback when I saw how thick the lotion is but I am pleasantly surprised. The Fair to Light is perfect for my skin and it evens it out nicely before I apply my daily makeup. I've typically tried BB creams in the past for this purpose but they all make me break out. I'd highly recommend this over a BB cream. Great product!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm used to using \"kiss my face tinted moisturizer\" which I thought was alittle cakey but I loved the coverage with a little moisturizer added to it. This Aveeno product doesn't seem so cakey to me.  It actually has less coverage then I'm used to and bc it's \"radiant\" has a bit of sheen, which I'm not used to and actually don't really like.  It would prob. be nice for going to the beach, to the lake or for other active outdoor activities, but not something I want to wear to church or to a nice function (which is usually when I want to add some tint).  I won't buy this again, but will be shopping around for something without sheen, as the kiss my face tinted moisturizer has been discontinued."}

I am a natural platinum blonde so i go from very pale in the winter to a light tan as the weather warms.In general, this is a good quality product with adequate coverage & excellent SPF protection &  while transparent it also evens out the complexion. I believe it has a powder base as this seems to sink into large pores and deep lines. TO avoid this, I put 3 drops of a higher SPF &  mix it into the Aveno and then apply. This takes care of the problem.I also bought the light and medium and mix the two together to get the perfect shade. I store it mixed in a clean glass baby food jar & capped tight."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love these but feel a bit profligate ordering something I could probably concoct at home. There appears to be some mild soap, witch hazel and aloe applied to compressed fiber pads which are disposable....Not very green. I use them more than once because they lather so richly and after two uses, I clean my sink and vanity with them. They don't strip my skin of all of its oils and leave my face feeling fresh without any irritation. The only improvement would be to have the lotion and use my own wash cloths...."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My boyfriend and I both have very fair skin that's prone to redness. Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist is a little too orange and shiny on its own. But mixed with Eucerin Redness Relief moisturizer, it's the perfect moisturizer to cover up small imperfections, reduce redness, and provide a natural-looking tone. By itself on my boyfriend, it looks like he's wearing some sort of shimmery makeup. But mixed with the Eucerin Redness Relief (which is green in color), it looks very neutral and natural. I also love the SPF 30!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Ok, i love aveeno products but this is a total FAIL!! And a waste of $$ for that matter. I'm on a budget, and i was looking for something budget-friendly from a drug store. After all the hype about this product, i decided to give it a try. First of all, the scent was overbearing, too greasy, my skin is combination/oily, and this made it worse!! I was extremely oily all day even make-up didn't help. I also developed a rash on my T-zone. I'm a very patient person so i stuck with it for a month before dumping it! Started using St.ives and so happy with the results not to mention the price is 2 less for what i paid for this junk! Too bad i won't get my hard earned $$ back!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I had one of these decades ago when I blow dryed my hair and used hot rollers -- I thought the towel was great.  I recently bought another, as my hair is very long and naturally curly (it has to air dry).  First of all, this towel will not stay twisted in a turban while I put on moisturizer, etc., and second, it soaks up so much moisture that my hair dries frizzy (even with product on it).  I'm dissappointed with my purchase, and would not recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair that need to be air dried."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Bought this to use at the pool. I like that it's thin. I would say the absorbency is the same as a regular thick towel (not moreso, but it's super thin so I'm still a fan). I have loads of long hair, and I still find this towel a bit too big. It's not quite big enough for a full body towel, so I wish it were smaller or bigger, and less in between. Thought about trying a hair turban, but I suspect they're not as user-friendly (especially for tons of hair) as they appear.But overall I'm pretty happy with it. Again, love the light, thiness. Perfect for the gym."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this towel to wrap around my hair because normal bath towels make my hair frizzy. This towel definitely cuts down on frizz and makes my hair look much more tame. It is the perfect size to wrap my head with and does not feel to heavy on it. The only issue I have with this towel is that it is not as absorbent as I need it to be. If I had fine to normal hair, I would probably give this product 5 stars. However, I have a lot of thick, curly hair that sops up water like a sponge so I need a little more absorbency than this towel provides. Overall, I would say to give this towel a try. There's a reason why it has got so many good reviews."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel is very absorbant and soaks up water in a jiffy.  The towel is big enough to wrap around very long hair and is shaped longer lengthwise to make a turbin if desired.  Hair dries much quicker with the use of this towel.  I see only one drawback, and that is the towel is sort of smooth and a little bit slippery, which takes some practice to get it to stay on your head.  This is the only towel I reach for now after washing my hair and makes for less drying time with the hair dryer. Worth the price and a good investment for those of us with longer hair."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Having obtained one of the Aquis towels from a brick and mortar store over 2 years ago, I decided to get another for gym and travel purposes. The previous Aquis towel has stood in good stead, maintaining its smooth feel and quickly drying after use. Even if you have short or medium length hair, using this towel as a turban and then using it to absorb some of the water left in your hair can shorten your time with a wet head or your time under the blow drier. Or if you choose, drape it over your pillow and you won't end up with a \"terry cloth\" face the next morning after slumber.If you're traveling to someplace where towels are stingy or none existent, this would be a good general use item to take along without too much weight or bulk. You won't dry your body with it but it would make a good supplement."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Years ago, I bought a similar towel from the Body Shop (I'm talking fifteen years ago) and was terribly upset when it reached its final days.  I searched but couldn't find a similar one on the market.  When I saw this as a suggestion for me (thanks Amazon) I read the reviews and purchased it. Now I haven't had it long enough to notice any kind of smell, but I immediately noticed the difference versus a regular towel.  I have fine hair that doesn't take too long to dry, but I like to get it as dry as possible before I expose it to the heat of a blow dryer.  Not only am I going to order a couple more for me, I plan on ordering them this Christmas as presents for the girls in my life.  Don't hesitate!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have to admit that this has been used as a spare dryer for the past year, but it is still used twice a month at least. It saw heavy use with waist length hair the three years prior. Even though it now costs almost half of what I paid for it, I still think it is a decent value. My Rusk 1900 watt ceramic dryer blows this dryer away, but it isn't fair to compare an $80 dryer to something that now costs $15. The amount of heat is pretty good and it gets my hair dry in an acceptable amount of time. The cold air button is really more of a \"less hot air\" than actual cold air, but I really don't have a use for cold air, anyway. After all these years, the cord is starting to bend oddly right at the plug, so I don't think it has a lot of life in it left unless I find a way to replace the cord. But I still think I got my money's worth."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I gave this dryer a 5 because I am very satisfied with the speed that it dries and how soft and smooth my hair is right afterwards.  This is probably not the only dryer that will give these kinds of results and it's probably not the best.  But if you have thick long hair like mine(reaches my waist)this is a handy tool.  It is a little heavy but it shouldn't be a problem if you only need to hold it for 5-10 minutes.  The real reason why I chose this ionic dryer is because I love Revlon's button configuration. The top button lets me adjust the temperature from cool, warm to hot.  And the bottom button adjusts the air flow from low, med to high. It lets me control and style my hair how I want to. I get so frustrated when the temperature corresponds to the air flow setting because it won't let me use hot on low or cool on med...catch my drift?  Anyway, nice dryer:)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've always had fine, straight hair. In the 80s, I used perms to help, but I didn't want to fry my hair the rest of my life, so I looked for alternatives.I went through all kinds of styling tools fromRevlon RV261 20-Roller Ionic Professional HairsettertoConair CD103JCS Satin Finish 1-1/2-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron, and then some...even hair products like Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray Extreme 7 oz..I finally stumbled across this triple-barrel iron. While it takes much longer to style my hair, it doesn't fall flat after only a few hours...in fact, I've had my waves last overnight.I would not recommend it to someone who is in a hurry, or anyone with shoulder-length or shorter hair...if you don't have long hair, using this iron will make you look ridiculous."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "my poor hands, cracked, peeling, painful, terrible hangnails, cracked nails, painful skin. this cures all of it in like a day. it's just like all the other reviews say. i garden and do a lot of housechores (we're poor as dirt so i'm always cleaning) and this is the only thing that's ever worked. i actually love the smell. and it rubs in super quickly, or perhaps it's my hands that suck it up so fast... either way i use it every day. i lost my last jar and had to replace it as i was in hell without it. thank you badger balm."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I am originally from Wisconsin, so I'm used to dry, cold weather.  However, I have lived in Texas for the last 3 years and my hands have never been as dry as they are right now.  My knuckles are red and flaky.  I have an office job, so my hands are not even in water a lot, but they are extremely dry and wrinkly.  I have tried jojoba oil and it helped better than regular lotion, but still not what I was looking for.  I came across this and love that it is organic and it works better than anything I have found yet.  My hands are still a bit rough, but nothing like they were before.  It does have a slightly funky smell---smells like pepto to me---but definitely worth it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I really hoped this would have worked, but unfortunately it was a let down. I have mildly curly and thick hair (but not coarse). I straighten my hair almost daily. I tried all the tools and still hated it! It doesn't even get hot, even when left for about 10 minutes. The straightener SUCKS! The crimper is even worse...no matter how long you hold it, how small the section of hair, or even the amount of hairspray put in before using it....it wouldn't do the job...just wave it the tiniest....making it look like my natural hair anyway. The curlers aren't impressing either. Seriously, I'm better off using my mother's hair tools from the 80s.....I would throw this thing out, but my mother bought me this for Christmas only a couple months ago."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Now that I'm over 50, I can't believe I still get acne.  I found this product on a whim and use it 3-4 times a week.  It's a thick white cooling gel that you can wash off immediately or wait and use it like a mask.  I can't believe that it has cleared up my skin and tightened up pores.  I truly wish I had this as a teenager.  I've never had a problem with it over-drying.  It's not expensive either when you consider that the better your skin looks, the better you feel.  Great stuff!  Walgreens and most drug stores carry this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this since I was about 22, about 10 years ago.  I use it only nightly, as I find it too greasy for daytime wear.  When I use it faithfully at night, I find that no matter what I am using in the AM (now a clinique gel) that my skin is clearer and evener than when I don't use it.  The price is affordable here, and in general, compared to other lotions that are of good quality.  I have tried many more expensive products but this works the best to keep my skin clear, without drying it.  My skin is prone to dryness and redness and I use this along with the aveeno calming cleanser and I don't use anything else on my face at night."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm one of those people who had a sprinkling of acne as a teen (which was taken care of by Retin-A) and then nothing until later in life. For some reason, when I turned 35- BOOM. My skin went haywire. I went to a dermatologist and he gave me a variety of things, but the basic advice was stick to a \"clean\" soap (I usePurpose Gentle Cleansing Bar, 6-Ounce Bars (Pack of 2)) and use a deep cleaning product with salicylic acid.The Aveeno Clear Complexion pads REALLY worked. I don't use them everyday, maybe three times a week, because they are very drying. But they definitely clean the skin well. I also use them in conjunction with a pure sea salt scrub (I dip the pad in the loose sea salt and scrub my face) and it does an AMAZING job of cleaning my skin and keeping it clear without turning it into a dry painful mess.So, I highly recommend this for anyone dealing with fussy skin!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I used to use a moisturizer from Yves Rocher but it got too expensive and it was only 1.7 oz.This product is amazing and is much better than what I was using. It makes your skin so soft but yet the acne is kept at bay. I haven't had any acne since I have been using this product which is an amazing 2 weeks!This product is very affordable and I love that it is 4 oz.I use this moisturizer with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Bar. These 2 products are really great together."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought these for the mild acne on my chin and for convenience sake I mean, cleanser and exfoliater in one pad, plus great reviews AND a decent price, sounded great. Well, I used these at night for one week and these evil little pads ruined my face. I had and still have little red bumps all over my forehead and cheeks like my skin was burned off! I haven't used the pads in 2 days now, but my skin is still very dry, even peeling in some spots and the bumps are still there. Oh and my acne is still there too.No, I haven't changed anything else in my skincare routine either.I've NEVER had skin problems before, besides the above mentioned mild acne on my chin, so seeing red bumps all over my face was a little frightening. Hopefully they'll go away soon..I like Aveeno, I really do, so this is very disappointing, if I could give this zero stars I would."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "i LOVE this moisturizer. It is thick enough that i can get proper coverage for just a small amount. It absorbs very quickly and does not feel heavy or oily. I will put this on in the morning and be good all day.My main issue before using this moisturizer was my forehead would dry out in the winter and would have skin flakes. It was particuarly bad after i got out of the shower. Now i just put this on and my skin is perfect.I use this with a combination of cetaphil in the shower and i rarely EVER break out. My skin is very soft and looks amazing.Yes, this is kinda pricey. But a little will go along way. Any more that one squirt and you have too much. So that bottle will last a good while. If you are in doubt, BUY THIS!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The entire Aveeno Clear Complexion line is amazing. This moisturizer in particular is amazing, and I usually can never find it in stores which is why I strictly have to order it on Amazon - which I am not complaining about! This order always arrives literally 2 days after I buy it, and I am in love with how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. I have very sensitive skin with some oily spots and acne..and this cream is perfect after washing my face in the morning and at night. What I love best about this product is that it doesn't make my face more oily, and it keeps my skin feeling refreshed even during the summer. Love it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought these and they come with 28 pads. The formula is great - acne spots that usually took months to clear up, now clear up within a couple of weeks. It really does help to even skin tone and is gentle on the skin. It keeps my skin smooth and seems to be improving the overall look of it. However, I'm not the only one in my home that uses acne cleansers and these pads only lasted 2 weeks between my fianc&eacute; and myself. So my only complaint is that you have to get them more frequently than other cleansers. I ended up getting the Clear Complexion foaming cleanser - same formula and will last longer."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I bought this because it has soy in it and I know soy helps to even the skin tone. I thought the salicylic acid it contains would help to keep my skin clear as well. But this made my already oily skin appear to be greasy. By mid day if I ran my hand over my face I could see the oil on my hand as well. There is also only 0.5% salicylic acid which really does nothing to control chronic acne.The good points are that the pads are nice and large and it smells nice and lathers up nicely. In fact I continued to use it b/c I liked the way the lather felt on my face, but it just got to be too oily for me so I stopped. If you have dry skin, I recommend it, but I do not recommend it for people who have oily skin and chronic or severe acne."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I cut these in half with a sharp, clean pair of scissors and put them all back in the container. It doubles my use as I found the pads are really big, much bigger than Stridex pads, they are generously full of sudsy product and I felt I was throwing them out half-used before deciding to cut them ahead of time.The salicylic acid is just the right amount to prevent breakouts. The pads have enough texture to give me a good exfoliation, and I usually have enough to clean my neck and chest with the back side. My skin looks great, and if I ever get the slightest blemish, usually around my t-zone, I use an oxy spot treatment with benzoyl peroxide. I find the salicylic acid coupled with the occasional benzoyl spot treatment has become the perfect combination.Remember, cut a few in half and I think you'll find it's still more than enough to clean your face."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I usually break out in the summer. I sweat a lot while gardening and my pores get clogged, especially on my forehead. Since, I've change my skin regimen, my breakouts have been minimal to nil. Here is what I do. 1) Wash my face morning and night, 2) Use witch hazel pads, and then 3) finish off with this moisturizer. I always thought washing my skin too much would dry it out, but it's just fine, and most importantly - pimple-free. Since I am now using this moisturizer as part of my regimen, I guess I will give this product some of the credit. I just re-ordered."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I LOVE this stuff. Too bad I just discovered this last week & it has been DISCONTINUED! I'm so upset!I used it this morning & then said to my husband \"How does my face look?\" He replied \"like you have on make-up\"  I don't wear ANY makeup so my complexion is important to me. This does the trick! Makes my face so clear and radiant. I've used it for a week on my combination skin at it's the best cleanser I have ever used.I will have to buy this where ever I spot it because I can't stand the thought of being without it forever. I just found another bottle today so maybe when I'm all out I'll giveAveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser, 6.7 Ouncea try."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I fortunately grew out of the annoying pimple phase, but I still have combination skin with a T-zone that becomes oily by early afternoon. This product, in conjunction with the Olay Complete Daily Defense All Day Moisturizer with SPF 30, has FINALLY succeeded in minimizing my oiliness. I do still have dry areas, for which the moisturizer works well. I occasionally get a pimple, and I noticed that the frequency has decreased since I started using this cleanser.One star off for minor reasons: 1) I personally didn't mind this, but my fiance didn't like that the cleanser is so light and foamy. He prefers something more substantial in texture so that he knows he's really getting clean; and 2) after a while, the pump got sticky and lost its spring. Now, after pushing down, I have to manually lift up the nozzle so that I can pump again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Searching for ways to stop break outs i decided to give this product a try. It has a strong smell of peppermint and it makes your skin feel tighter after use. It helped stop my break outs and clear them up. Although it is only 1 oz a finger tip amount will cover your entire face. The product lasted me about 2 months. I decided to use tea tree oil instead just because this product is so high priced but you do get what you pay for, all organic ingredients. Organic is never cheap."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have pretty straight hair and every now and then like a different look. I have tried regular curling irons (1 inch and 1.5 inch); the curls are good but they don't last long and I on't get soft curls with those. This is a great product for soft curls or smoothing out hair in the morning. Best part is, the curls last much longer compared to the regular curling irons. Only thing I would have loved to see in this product is a better brush, this brush is not bad at all, but my hair slip out of it while curling as the teeth are smaller than expected. With loner teeth I guess this would be an ideal product for me :)"}

Many heat temp selections sogentle on hair.  Use on DRY hair !  Heats fast, easy to hold without burning fingers.Better than curling iron because it grips the hair easily.  Same results, but much faster.Leaves hair super shiny as the barrel is ceramic.  Nothing else on the market that has this muchquality at such a low, low price.VERY, VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER !!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I got this because I have fine, wavy brunette hair that often frizzes.- I wanted something that will reduce fly-away hair- I wanted a way to style my hair super fast between washes and still look good.This does the trick.- Variable heat - great.- Tip stays cool so you can actually handle both ends.- Nibs on the brush stay cool while the barrel heats up so I don't burn my skull Ever anymore.- Super fast warm-up time.- I can use it to straighten my hair by just drawing the brush through my hair straight- I can use it to curl my hair by turning it while the hair is wrapped around it.It does risk tangling if you wrap long hair around it more than twice, so I try not to do that.All in all, I love this puppy.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the greatest thing since sliced bread...well no not really. I read so many rave reviews on this. When I first received it I was disappointed. I tried to curl my hair with it to no avail. I couldn't understand why so many hyped reviews. I was going to return this but then I read it takes practice. I practiced and I learned I had been using it all wrong. Now I have gotten the hang of it and am only keeping my old clamp curling iron as back up in case something happens to this one. Really awesome..the reason for only 4 stars is because your hair can get tangled pretty easy and when it does, it's not too pleasant. Also the cord is very short, can't move to my normal \"getting ready\" spot, need to stay close to the outlet."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I like this brush as an alternative to curling irons and wands used on my slightly longer than shoulder-length hair.  I had one in highschool but I didn't like it.  I though 30 years later, the quality would have improved.  I was right.  You have to take the hair in smaller sections and the curl is not defined like with an iron. It's soft, flowy curls.  However, within hours, my hair was flat.  So, unless your hair is shorter and curlier, I would not recommend if you want real curls that last.  It is NOT good for fine or thin hair."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "But rips out a lot of hair. But I like it because it's something different & it gives your hair much more volume. Still perfecting my skills in using this device. I learned how to do perfect curls with a straightener / flat iron. But I think this tool has even more potential to make different styles of curls, such as spirals etc, because the bristles hold hair strands in place, and you can maneuver the way you fold the curl. Pretty interesting. Only wish the heated part was ceramic & that there was no crack in between the metal & plastic handle, which is the part that rips out the most hair."}

I decided to get an early start on my darker \"fall look\" by changing my very light brown and blondish tipped hair to a light to medium chocolate brown with slight golden hints (as pictured). I hoped it would look closer to my natural color..but with more depth. And well, this dye turned it very dark brown, nearly black at the ends. I hope it fades soon. I have to say, it doesn't look so bad, I had black hair for years in college. It was a bit of a shock and wish I had read reviews on it before purchasing in the store! I gave three stars because I'm remaining optimistic that it will fade a bit!"}

It took a week and a half for the water to FINALLY run clear in my shower and I spend a lot of time rinsing in general and shower every day. That being said, it's an ok color. It is dark but not as an intense red as I would hope for. Id say it's more of a dark brown/red. It's more of a natural color. I would use it again if I wanted to make less of a statement and just make sure I used a towel for my hair that I don't mind ruining for a while."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been very discouraged lately at the changes in hair color.  It used to last much longer, and the color was better.  This time I tried Medium Auburn, and it said to leave it in for 20 minutes.  I left it in for  45 minutes just to be sure, and there's barely any color.  My hair is soft and shiny, I'll give it one star for that. But I could get these same results using a deep conditioner, and it is FAR too expensive for that.  I guess I'm going to have to get brave and graduate to henna."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The color is pretty, but no where near the color on the box.  It is a mahogany/red color.  Much deeper and quite red.  There is NO gold.  I am disappointed with how dark and how red the color is.  The grey covered very well (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1).  I don't really like the formulation -- the gel colorant is quite drippy. I also like that it only takes 25 minutes to process.  I might try it again if I had confidence about the color choice."}

I'm very happy with this color. I have been dying my hair for 30 year's and  have tried almost every color. I used to use Feria, but I'm sold on this now!!!"}

I chose this brand because the before photo on the box appeared to match my hair the closest and the after photo best matched the shade of blonde I wanted to be. I applied this brand to my hair and it did absolutely nothing. It says on the directions to leave it in for 25 minutes. I wasn't noticing a change so I left it in for an hour. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the conditioner smells amazing and it left my hair feeling very soft. Too bad the dye doesn't work."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this for a few weeks now.  I'm not noticing too much in the &#34;firming&#34; department yet, however I like the cream a lot.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother or irritate it at all.  The smell is pleasant and the cream goes on smooth.  I wake up &#34;fresh-faced&#34; without an oily sheen as I've expreienced using other night creams.  I'll keep watching on the &#34;firming&#34;, but I will definitely purchase this again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "You see so many products that claim to be the 1 that makes your skin flawless, but nothing compares to Olay.I have been using this exact product for almost 3 years and my skin glows, My skin is healthy and no wrinkles at the age of 40.I know good jeans have a lot to do with it and my family does have good jeans but most my family had some wrinkles by time they hit 40 & I have nothing and I know it Is from the use of Olay 2x's a day (morning & night). I highly recommend this product to everyone. I get compliments all the time on my skin glowing and also everyone thinks I am in my mid 20's. IT WORKS!!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Some years ago, I saw that an independent testing lab had rated Olay as the most effective at achieving visible results and had bested competing products costing multiple times as much.  I bought some and was very pleased with the results. This Total Effects Night Treatment was a new product that I wanted to try, and it's difficult not to sound like a contrived television commercial at how impressed I am.  It's nothing short of remarkable how smooth and nourishing it is to my middle age skin, with no irritation or oiliness.  After finishing my first jar and not being able to find it at my local grocery store, I opted for a heavily advertised competing product that they did have. Big mistake and I actually had to return it after just a few days for the disturbing irritation it caused to my skin. Everyone's skin, of course, has it's own sensitivity and chemistry, but for me at least, I can't recommend this highly enough. It does what it says and at a very reasonable price."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using Olay products for a number of years, and at 67 years of age, I don't have any wrinkles on my face, neck, or upper chest. This could, of course, be due to heredity because my 94 year old mother doesn't have much in wrinkles either. There is really no way to know for sure, but I do like the feel of this product on my skin. When I use it, my skin feels soft and moisturized, and not greasy as it does with some other products. I will continue to use this and other Olay products."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've been using Nivea's face scrub for years, and I would never consider washing my face with any other product. The scrubbing elements in this product gently scrape the dirt and dead skin from your face, and leave it feeling revitalized and really clean. If your skin is oily, or if you work in a humid or otherwise grimy environment, then you will certainly appreciate this scrub. I use it after taking a shower and/or right before I shave. I feel that even when my face is not particularly grimy, this scrub helps me get a smoother-feeling face that is much easier to shave. Overall, this is a great product that has become and integral part of my personal care arsenal."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm assuming that what they tell you is true and you need to occasionally run sandpaper over your face to strip a small layer off. In that case, I'd recommend this to do it.I only use this once a week or once a fortnight. But when I feel particularly that there's too much skin on my face and I need to strip a layer off I use this. The good thing about it is that it cleans quite well yet does not leave your skin dry. It smells nice without being overpowering. And I only use it before sleep and never after shaving because I think that shaving already strips a layer off your skin.So, cleans nicely, does not leave the skin raw, I recommend it!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I didn't like it in the beginning. When I first started using it 2 months ago, my hair felt too dry, like all the oil was washed off my this shampoo. I live in Colorado, and you don't want to make your hair any drier than this State already makes it be. BUT: 2 months later I actually started seeing the change in my overall hair health. I haven't changed my diet or anything, while my hair started looking better and better after every wash. Having extremely fine and thin hair, this shampoo makes it look thicker. Seriously, once I washed my hair with my bf's shampoo, and my ponytail was thinner than my pinkie. The next day I washed it with this shampoo, and the size of my ponytail grew to the size of my thumb:) Believe me, it's a BIG change for me. I can actually see the difference."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Amazing sunscreen! I can't use any other after getting this. Even better testimonial is my husband will actually use this too, and he is one to HATE anything creamy. A very small amount of this goes a very long way. It works too, I burn so easy and for an average day (4 to 5 hours) of being in direct sun outside swimming, I have never needed to re-apply. Never had any sunburn, or even the feeling of being sunburned that most sunscreens leave me with. This really works. It has a nice clean smell too, so great for men or women. Non-greasy, it is a little more massaging to rub it in than most of the suncreens I've used in the past, but nothing to difficult at all. Just rub it in and enjoy your day. You will smell fresh and clean the whole time too. Great stuff!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "My son got tanned despite of using this daily. He had golf lessons 3 times a week in the mornings! and only for one hour! he came back home darker after each lesson. My husband got a tan too but didn't burn. I have to admit, we are currently in South America, perhaps it will work better in Northern Hemisphere.  It's not easy to spread, leaves white cast, you have to rub it a lot to get rid of whiteness, and hairy fuzzy men, forget it!!! We tried Australian gold brand (easier to spread but stinks to high heavens), and no difference in protection."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Over the past year, I had gel french nails done bi-weekly in a salon, unfortunately, after about 1 year, my nails were burning, which I know is due to filing/sanding. I did tons of research and came up with a non-salon regimen that works for me. I use Hoofmaker Hand and Nail lotion, Nailtiques Plus 2, Zeva Crystal file, and Zeva Nail Brite. Finally, I use 2 different cuticle cream a few x's per day - Barielle cuticle cream. Barielle's cuticle cream dries nicely. All of this together has made a huge difference. I never thought it was possible to have natural nails that actually looked nice."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've written off Barielle as the most high priced gimmick products I've ever tried.  This doesn't do a darned thing.  It's greasy, oily, and if it worked, I'd deal with it, but it does nothing.  I'm sick that I spent the money.  Don't spend yours on this.  There's another product sold here on Amazon called Carmichel's Cuticle Cream.  I've used that for 20 years or so and it does work.  I was experimenting again, and I should know better.  So I bought two little tubs of Carmichaels (or Carmichel's) and my nails are better again.  I just don't know how this brand stays in business.  They won't be getting mine again, that's for sure."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Absolutely, a miracle nail cream from Barielle. Barielle's reputation stems from this outstanding nail strengthening cream that originally was created to condition the hooves of thoroughbred racehorses; the side affect being that the groomers also developed beautifully strong, peel and split free nails. My nails have always been prone to peeling and breakage. Ultimately, I made matters worse by opting to wear acrylic nails on and off in the past to cover up these issues. Thankfully, that craze is long over; and my nails have benefited ever since by using Barielle. Works well withBarielle Natural Nail Camouflage, .5 fl oz (14.8 ml)"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product didn't work for me, but that's not to say it will not work for you. My issues with this product was that I burned my fingers each time I tried to put the roller in my hair, you only get a few clips with the product and they didn't work very well--At least they didn't work well for me. I gave this product away and even that person didn't want it. I may be a fan of some Conair products, just not this one."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I curl my hair pretty frequently, I'm a fan of Old Hollywood style and have been on the lookout for a good pair of rollers for ages. I was hesitant to get Conair ones because most of my other cheaper hair supplies have been disappointing, but I read some good reviews and decided to go for it.So glad I did! These rollers are great, they get super hot and retain heat for forever. I have really thick heavy hair, but letting these rollers cool while in my hair ensures I have bouncy awesome curls for DAYS. Love them!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have very fine hair that is determined to be straight.  I had a set of curlers that were starting to go out on me (they took 45 minutes to heat up and did not hold the curl).  I recently decided to replace it with the Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Hot Rollers, since I was interested in curlers that would heat up quickly.  They heat up just as quickly as they say.  They are incredibly hot and do a great job of putting in a curl that holds.  Like I said, I have the kind of hair that wants desperately to be straight, and my curl stays all day with these curlers.  They are fairly hot on the edges, but I have yet to find any curlers that won't be challenging to handle for more than a minute.  I would definitely recommend these to any of my friends."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I rarely ever return items because it's such a hassle. But this, is being returned immediately. The idea is actually very good- it has a side heater to heat up the clips as well as the rollers, a feature I've never seen before. However, the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair. No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds. Even when I stayed completely still (very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers) they would still fall out. They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Is plastic getting expensive?  Because the plastic that the hinged cover on this is made out of is SO THIN...I would describe it as \"fragile.\"  In fact, there's already a small crack on one side.The on/off switch was also faulty - I had to jiggle it back and forth to get it to turn on initially.  It would only stay on if I kept the switch positioned in the middle.This is by FAR the poorest quality set of hot rollers I have ever bought.I only gave it two stars because it DID heat up evenly, and the rollers themselves would be nice in a better \"house.\"Thank goodness the switch was faulty and part of it arrived cracked, since you can return defective items and not pay for the return shipping on Amazon!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "Only one roller changes the color dot to show when heated and you have to heat the outer clips individually on the three spaces provided at the far right. So, if you need to use a particular size again that isn't the one with the dot, there's no way to tell if it's heated or not. Then you have to wait for one of the three clips to heat as well. It is weird!  It seemed to take a long time to heat up, though I didn't time it.This is an ok set, but I sure wouldn't rave about it. If not for the hassle, I'd return it.I just ordered another set that looks like the one I used to have with the U-shaped clips (BaByliss Pro) and hopefully it will be what I'm thinking it is."}

It should be a room fragrance as well until you're ready to wash with it lol....I had the lavendar and jasmine and it's the first time I've ever seen  a CLEAR NATURAL SOAP. I thought that was fascinating. The scents are awesome and my fiance used the lavender soap for his dry skin since he tends to get rashes when he scratches himself. and he says he likes it so far. Worth the cheap price so give it a shot!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "The trimmer arrived today.  We tried it out by having the wife cut my hair.  it trimmed it up nice and short.  The finishing trimmer appears pretty delicate, but I think if handled carefully it will provide a relatively long life.  Lots of cutter guides to use, theres even one for trimming eyebrows.  Or should I say \"eyebrow\", because if you need to trim it, you probably only have one covering both eyes.I am not to thrilled with the carry case.  Mine arrived cracked.  it appears to be pretty cheap plastic and there are no separators inside the case so everything will slide around.I gave it 4 stars because of the case.  It does appear to be a pretty good trimmer for a very inexpensive price.  I guess if I wanted extreme heavy duty and a great case I could have spent 5 times more money.  But I don't need to this time."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "i have tried a lot of sulfur masks ever since i started to get acne at 11 yrs old (i know sad lol) and this is by far one that i can see improvements on the size of my acne in days. i use it as a mask and leave it on for a while or as a spot treatment an leave it overnight and i get great results. the price is unbeatable and its smell minty (like spearmint gum or toothpaste. there is little tightening feel (unless you put a thick layer) and very little tingling sensation. once i rinse off, my skin doesn't feel dry (like the ddf sulfur mask) and i put a serum and moisturizer and my skin feels good.by no means does it completely  get rid of my acne, but it has made it more manageable and i wear less makeup because of it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used many many different masks for my acne prone skin and this one is definitely one of the top ones on my list.  I apply it to my face twice a week in the evening and leave it for 45 minutes before washing it off then apply a thin layer of balancing moisturizer (for acne skin).  I didn't even need to use any medication afterwards.  It's noticeable that mask helps the skin to heal from broken pimples or those that were about to develop into big ones.  One of the big plus that come with this product is that it's not too expensive so I strongly recommend it!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "It helped made my pores smaller and make my face looked more clean. The mask does really dries out my face so I would have to use a good amount of moisturizer after. Another con is that it leaves a weird smell. It lingers for a couple of hours but you get use to it. I would recommend this mask to anyone who wants to have a clearer face and would use it maybe once per 1-2 weeks depending on how dry your skin easily gets. My skin is combination and once per week is enough for me. I don't really use it frequently as before now because it takes a while to squeeze it out of the tube and slather over your face evenly."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have been using this mask for about 30 years now ..... If you have acne breakout this is a good product and it doesn't cost a fortune...I have tried other masks but keep coming back to this one.......my skin is no longer problematic ....my friends now  cant believe how great my skin is ......when I tell them my ups and downs with hormonal acne...thanks !!! queen helene!!!  I have no scars !!! I just found out amazon carries this product at such a great price!!!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've used this for several years now, probably bordering 6 years. The formula hasn't changed and if it did, I have felt no difference. For the price, this is amazing stuff. You can almost feel the crap being taken out of your pores. When you first apply it, there's a nice tingly, non-painful minty feeling.I use this as both a cleanser and a mask. Works fine either way. My only suggestion is that they find some way for the mask to roll off smoother. I would pay double for that. Right now, using it as a mask and washing it off is a pain."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For once--a beauty product that actually DOES what it SAYS it does. In just one application, it dried up my t-zone oil slick, shrunk my pores (which are big enough in which to carry loose change), evened out my skin tone, and softened my skin to baby's butt softness. It even seemed to tighten my fine lines. The minty scent is truly refreshing (AND relaxing). The clay texture is soft, smooth, and feels nice going on--very therapeutic. Oh!...and it lasts forEVER....oh!..and it's inexpensive. OH..my God..............I love this stuff.Bottom line: Stop spending ridiculous amounts on more expensive brands with fancy packaging and get something in a butt-ugly package that actually works. Period."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "While I was waiting to get this product me (being impatient) went out and bought a knock off brand from a local store. I'd have to say so far the knock off brand worked better than this. I did not feel the face tightening effect other viewers had described with this product (though i did with the store bought brand) and this has caused me to break out in the most unpleasent of places on my face. Weird places like in between my eyes and eyebrows and forehead. Perhaps I will try again in the future but I am dissapointed in this product right now."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For an inexpensive mask, this does the job for my face, especially when I have a small breakout.  I've been using this for 14 years and hasn't let me down since.  I use it a few times a week to keep the acne down with a minimum time of 20 minutes.  However after removing it, tone (if needed) and moisturize (if necessary) I have recognize it can be somewhat drying, but it's not too bad, in my opinion.  Still the best mask I use for breakouts."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I'm a big fan of Queen Helene's masks for one particular reason: They're as effective as high end brands, and generally work. This mask in particular is great at evening your skin tone, and shrinking your pores if you use it regularly. I use it at least three times a week, and it makes my skin appear healthy and glowing. I'd also, recommend their other mask,Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, 8 Ounce. It's an excellent mud mask, and its tingling sensation really makes me feel like it's deep cleaning."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I couldnt find a peel off face mask in dept. stores unless it was just a one time application.  I looked everywhere. I finally found this on Amazon and it was reasonably priced so I tried it and I love it.  My face feels so soft when I pull the mask off and it will come off in one big piece if you want it to. They make my face feel so fresh.  I dont get this sensation with masks that you just wipe off with a washcloth. I will buy more of this."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This product is as close to useless as it can get.  It's a waste of money.  First of all, it falsely advertises as  it doesn't \"peel\" anything.  Normally with a face masque of any kind, you will see a remarkable instant \"glowing\" or \"brightening\" of your skin because it deep cleans.  This product is too thin to be of any benefit.  It does not deep clean and the slightest bit of perspiration will immediately start to dissolve it.  After one tube, I would never buy it again and I do not recommend it."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This masque feels nice on your skin, but beyond that it had little benefit for me. It certainly didn't help clear my pores, in fact you could see the clay visibly clogging them even after I rinsed the masque off. If your skin is as oily as mine this will not take care of the oil much at all. I felt refreshed right after using it but within a few hours I was back to my normal level of oiliness. Overall, I'm not impressed. There are several other masques around this price point that work much better than this one for my skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I love the mint julep face mask from this brand, and I love how cheap these are. However, if you are looking for a mask that purifies and tightens skin, I find it ironic that the mint julep does a better job in these two categories that this one is especially for.When you put the mask on it is super flaky and the dry pieces get everywhere. Make sure to leave it on 5-10 minutes longer than it suggests. My skin felt softer and more moisturized, and I think this would be the better of the two for sensitive skin, but don't buy it to tighten."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I like to switch up my beauty routine and usually mix fruit-based facials for myself, but I like mud as an alternative as well.This is a very good, cheap, basic product to use once a week. It will leave your skin feeling tighter and will give you a glow.I usually exfoliate my face and neck, then apply this for 30 minutes (yes, a little longer than recommended) and after washing it off, I use my night cream (Olay). That combination leaves my skin looking perfect for 3 days+.I recommend it for once a week use for normal to oily skin. If you have dry skin, this may make you feel a little too dry. I have used it on my body (dry skin), and I wouldn't use it there again."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I ordered this to try because most body washes irritate and dry  my super-sensitive skin.  This does the trick, it is very mild, and cleans without leaving your skin with that tight stripped feeling.  Nice, effective product at a good price. It is not heavily scented or as fancy as some other body washes, no bright colors or gritty beads, just a light natural scent (no added fragrance, which is  a big deal because fragrance is a major cause of allergic reactions) and an effective gentle body wash.  I highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I really need a body wash for my very dry , itchy winter skin. The reviews lead me to purchase this one, but so far it has made no more difference than my other regular body washes. I don't get it's appeal. I think I will maybe try something with ceremides perhaps next time. There are limited choices for extra dry skin from what I can see. I don't think I will repurchase this aveeno not to mention it is NOT sulfate free and I think it's the sulfates that keep my skin so dry after a shower.."}

This lotion has shea butter which is super rich & moisturizing.

{"label": 4, "raw": "I fully expected to like this.  It does make my skin softer, but it creates a sort of film on my skin that then will sort of get gritty and rub off if I rub my hands.  It's slightly waxy. It also seems to rub off on my clothing, which I can see if I'm wearing black or dark blue.  I wonder if it might actually be the \"oat kernel flour\" that does this? Colloidal oatmeal is a powder.  I'm not going to throw it out, but I'm not going to buy it again either. I bought this at a local drug store so I can't comment on what others have said about the product having been opened or used, except to say that I don't remember it being sealed in any way."}

I concocted a mixture of Shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter oil, vitamin e oil and have been putting it on my skin just for my skin to suck it in and be dry and itchy in about 2 hours. Yesterday, I bought this product, along with the matching body wash. No dryness, no itching.  I slept without scratching all freaking night for the first night in a month or so. What a relief! This is my new wintertime lotion."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I picked the 3.5 oz (100g) tube of this product off the supermarket shelf for silly reasons: it was bigger than most hand creams there but it was small enough to fit into my purse.After using it for a few days, I noticed that my hands and especially fingers felt soft and slightly slippery even after rinsing with water. I happen to read the text on the back of the packaging: the second of a list of 4 bullets said \"Lasts through hand washing.\" Of course, if you use strong soap and really scrub, you do have to re-apply the lotion afterwards, but I noticed that even after washing out a glass using dish detergent, my fingers still felt somewhat moisturized. I do apply more lotion but I don't 'have to' every time."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have really dry skin. It runs in my family and I've had to deal with it all my life, so I have experience with all kinds of lotion since I was a little girl. For dry skin I've mainly stuck with oil-based deep moisturizers. I tried \"water-based\"-feeling type lotions before and they were always so lightweight. But then I discovered Aveeno moisturizing line, specifically the 18-hour and now it's all I use. I have need for nothing else. What I like most about it is that it PENETRATES and HYDRATES from within (rather than sits on top of skin acting as a sealant). It hydrates within and how long it lasts (staying power) is the best I've seen. Also, I'm NO LONGER left with an oily or \"smudgy\" body (I'd leave smudges everywhere I touched due to the heavier, less effective lotions of the past). I feel deeply moisturized and non-oily - can't beat it. I'm a customer for life!"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the only body wash we use in this house.  All four females LOVE IT!  It is great on even the most sensitive skin among us.  It is gentle but leaves us feeling clean and our skin is so soft.  I wouldn't even want to try anything else.  As far as the scent, well, there really isn't a scent in this product.  The other varieties from Aveeno (with fragrance) I have not liked.  So I use this one and then after I shower I use Bath and Body Works Cucumber Melon lotion for a nice light scent on the skin.  I really don't think you can find anything better, whether you have sensitive skin or not."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "When our daughter had surgery last fall, she wasn't able to stand long enough to shower, and had gauze dressings that couldn't get wet.  I had been sponge bathing her, but her long hair desperately needed washing.  I picked up a bottle of this no-rinse shampoo at Walmart.I was able to massage it through her hair and then towel it dry, and get a comb through her matted hair.  It did remove most of the oil and made her hair smell better, although of course it wasn't as nice as an actual shampoo.  However, when you don't have a choice about being able to shower, this is a good option.  She felt better just having her hair somewhat clean and brushed after a week of lying there.I would recommend this if you are caring for someone who can't take a regular shower or bath, but wouldn't recommend it for a way to skip shampooing if you're able to shampoo."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I've tried allot of these types of products (should mention I'm a hair stylist & can get many hair products at half price or less) & even the so called \"expensive brand named ones\" to me I hated. They all stunk & looked like I dumped a bottle of baby powder all over my hair. With allot of good reviews on here I decided to give this one a whirl. Loved it! Yes, you do have to lather it until your hair is pretty wet but it WORKS (for me anyways) & I have very fine/kind of oily hair. Sure beats washing it every day & styling it over & over each day. Not to mention doing that every day really drys out & damages it. This doesn't. I recommend it for sure."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I have fibromyalgia and there are days when even taking a shower is too much.  Raising my arms over my head for the amount of time it takes to shampoo and condition will make my arms ache for the rest of the day.  This No Rinse Shampoo has been a godsend!  On the days I really must shampoo (I can mist my hair the second and third day after I shampoo), using this is perfect.  It makes my hair fresh and scalp clean.  I don't know how it works without having to rinse it out, but it doesn't leave it feeling sticky or full of residue, either.  It gives me one extra day of rest and that's important for some of us!Tip:  I would shower and shampoo normally the day after using this, however."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I wear lipstick from the minute I get up until I go to bed.  I've tried many other kinds, but I always go back to this.  It's simply the best.  It's very long wearing and unless you eat something greasy, it stays on most the day.  The darker colors have more staying power.  The conditioner on one end has a glossy shine, but if you don't like that, let it wear off.  You will need it at first or your lips will feel dry.  After the gloss wears off, you probably won't notice it.  I don't.  I really like that it has no fragrance. The only thing I don't like, is I can't carry it in my pocket without it coming unscrewed."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "For a lip gloss, the pigmentation and staying power is pretty great. Once it dries, it stays put and doesn't feel sticky (no more hair sticking to your lips on a windy day!).Just a head's up: it seems to form a plasticky coating on your lips that tends to peel/flake off, instead of just fade away. If I gently rub my lips together when wearing this, it literally forms little clumps that flake off. I wouldn't recommend this for people who tend to have dry lips. If that doesn't bother you, go ahead and give this a try."}

I'm not sure if it is apparent on other races but it is very noticeable on African American skin tones. It looks like I've applied cheap foundation shades too light on my face.I cannot wear it outdoors in front of people during the day (and I'm cheap! :) ) so I use it as my night time moisturizer before bed. Imagine using an SPF moisturizer only to bed...Will not repurchase once I've used it all."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I made the classic mistake of \"the fancier and more expensive the better\" when I was a dedicated Aveeno user. I thought my skin was moisturized and protected, but I didn't know what I was missing out on until I gave this a shot! For MUCH less money, I get double the SPF (unheard of to find a 30 spf face moisturizer at this price!!) and fewer breakouts because of the minimal additives (fragrances/skin \"brighteners\" read= literally GLITTER!)It leaves my skin soft without being oily and never feels tight or greasy after using. Now, I can slather this stuff on in the morning without wondering if I'm truly protecting myself from the sun and before bed without worrying about gross pimples popping up overnight!My mom was right - she always had Eucerin products around when I was a kid, and I've found out now for good reason! I hope they never stop making this stuff. It's done wonders for my skin and doesn't break my already tight budget."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is my go-to moisturizer. It's light (maybe a little too light for winter if you get really dry skin), and it has 30 spf which many doctors recommend nowadays.  Given the 30 SPF, this is by far the cheapest facial lotion I've seen here or anywhere else.  It absorbs well into my skin, does NOT smell strongly of sunscreen or anything really, and the pump dispenser is pretty good (though if you are a vigorous pumper it will look like something... gross and white... got squirted on you). The little plastic cap is good quality  --- it has never cracked on me like some other bottles. Even after months of use, it seems to treat my acne kindly, which is to say it doesn't really have an effect on it either way. Best of all though, this lotion never stings even if I get it close to my eyes.My only complaint is I wish they made 3oz bottles so I could take this on a plane."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "I switch around among the usual suspects--Eucerin, Aveeno, Neutrogena,etc. but this is my favorite. It's truly fragrance free with a high SPF, and a little goes a long way. It spreads nicely over the skin with a smooth feel. I don't notice the so-called white residue some have mentioned--I slather it on and let it dry for a minute or two, and if any excess cream is still visible I then blend it in easily. I haven't used it long enough to notice that my wrinkles are less visible--I don't really believe that anything topical will help anyway, and I'm not about to do anything more drastic, so this lotion is great for me. The price here for two is excellent."}
{"label": 4, "raw": "This is the only sun screen moisturizer that I can find that features the physical combination of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to provide true broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection without potentially harmful chemicals with adverse effects (like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which interfere with reproductive hormones and metabolism). Unlike chemical agents, physical agents are not susceptible to being absorbed into the skin after they are broken down by the sun. The product initially has a white tint, as if it doesn't have very good consistency, but this fades away within several minutes."}

I used other SPF 30 creams and did not have the effect.The pro is that sensitive skin won't react bad. I had no burning or tingling from this product. Just won't use it because I don't want to look white/pink and shiny"}
{"label": 4, "raw": "If you have lame genetic acne (like me!) that does whatever it wants, you NEED to try this moisturizer. All the topical treatments dry my skin out to flake off like a gosh dang lizard lady - and this is one of the very few things that works on gross flaky skin. More importantly, because this stuff sorted out my lizard skin, i'm way less likely to pick my face, and therefore way less likely to introduce bacteria to screw up my clear-ish skin. And let's not forget that acne treatments (retinoid creams, accutane, benzoyl peroxide) make your skin way more likely to burn so this SPF is killer.It has also lasted me for waaaaay longer than i expected! I use it maybe twice a day and a single bottle is still going strong after 6 months. It works fine under some primer and makeup as well.Eucerin: Great for lizard people, lasts forever, just the best everyday facial moisturizer on the market"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I first read THE PROPHET in college back in the 60's. The book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60's. It had a profound effect on me and became a book I always took with me. After graduation I joined the Peace Corps and during stressful training in country (Liberia) at times of illness and the night before I left, this book gave me great comfort. I read it before I married, just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses. I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future.Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word. I think that we as a nation should read AND learn the lessons here. It is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I discovered The Prophet fifty years ago in college and have read it dozens of times since then.  Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy.  If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it.  It doesn't care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.  Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Anything I've read by Gibran is, in my mind, flawless. This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran's work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this about a year ago and can't recall a great deal of the book. From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of the best, most inspiring philosophy/poetry books ever written!  I have read it over and over, though never tire of it.  It is a great reminder for what's most important in life and puts everything in perspective.  My favorite 'chapters' are Love, Marriage, Children and The first look. I am a romantic though, so the other chapters may appeal to you more....;-)  Absolutely classic and timeless.  Perfectly stands the test of time. My personal copy is from 1948 and is one of my favorite treasures."}

While, personally, I found nothing profound in the ideologies expressed in the book, I did find it, simply a pleasure to read. Even with the lack of philosophical epiphany, the style of the book in its fluid manner, the parallel structure of the chapters, and the brevity combined with the larger font in the piece, leave the reader, whether they agree with the philosophies therein or not, in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time. As, really, they probably have not, it really did not waste my time anyway; it only took a little over an hour to read (with breaks)."}

The Prophet was the first book I read written by Gibran, and ever since that first reading I have immersed myself in his extraordinarily consummate skill of exquisitely crafted words. To say the Prophet or any other writings by Kahlil Gibran is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are mediocre. I recommend that if you have not touched upon any of Kahlil Gibran's books, that you consider the Prophet as a good start. You will not be disappointed. A few other extraordinary works of art by Gibran: The Voice Of The Master; The Beloved; Sand And Foam; The Broken Wings; Between Night And Morn; The Earth Gods; and one of my personal favorites, though not so much a \"story,\" but rather a collection of personal letters to dearly beloved friends: Kahlil Gibran: A Self-Portrait."}

I read it a lesson at a time, understanding it to the best of my ability.I found a way of life in these words.  I could read it everyday and each time these words would dispense a new lesson... like a never ending treasure."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book is poetic myth,a work of beauty,whose every word drips a truth,and a thought of knowledge.Reading it is like swimming in realitybut a reality I have not known,till now.Kahlil Kahlil Gibran knew something we did not,he shared a bit of the wonder of simplicity.Though this is merely the preaching of a Prophet,Gibran is able to turn it into story,and I feel from the gut for all the characters.The Prophet is unsurpassed in form,in content best when speaking of beauty,in ways I had never known,and weakest when speaking of prayer.Certainly Gibran relies on the story of Jesus,and throughout there are allusions to his wordsand actions.But this is a new prophet,who speaks the words of old,though it be in new wineskin."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Reading a classic such as &quot;The Prophet&quot; is much more fruitful when it is revisited often, the lessons are applied and the reader reads as if Gibran is writing only to him or her.Sitting with this book in your hands can be like sitting across from Gibran, listening to him speak.  The accompanying art work also by Gibran gives it yet another rich element and peek into the soul of this incredible writer.Listen, embrace and breathe in these words.Open your mind and heart to The Prophet."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), the Lebanese-American poet and mystic never wrote anything finer than this 1923 volume, his masterwork. Had he written nothing before or beyond THE PROPHET, he would still be remembered into perpetuity.Each brief chapter of THE PROPHET addresses an aspect of the human condition, including Love, Marriage, Work, Pleasure, Buying and Selling, Children, Eating and Drinking, to name but a few. Gibran espouses no particular religious, ethical or moral system, and yet includes them all in this slim tome, written it seems, with a quill of light, not ink.A Higher Power (by whatever name you may call it) spoke through Gibran in the writing, a perfect letter to the ages, and an ultimate expression of Humanity."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book takes different themes such as work, love, etc. and poses them as questions that a community asks a wise man, who seems to be spirit talking. He is a man who is not so much of a religious base but more filled with a love of nature finding peace and depth through sensory and embracement of all dark and light. He is a person who has freedom in all areas of his life and learns from all things and all moments because of his openess and aliveness. He wants all people to gain awareness from their path thru eternity. This can be read in a variety of ways coming from each person's belief system. I read this when I was in a state of loss, loss of so much. This book can bring understanding and a shift in consciousness at least for a spell of time. It can expand who you are while you process and integrate his writings. I most definately recommend this book, for all people on their journey in whatever space they are in on their path of life."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Since I first read The Prophet when I was a teenager I have had a copy by my side.  It is a gift of such value in comprehending the depth and meaning of this wonderful Life in its beauty of every relationship that engages us.  Be it work, parenting, eating, death or love, Gibran paints word images of such divine and exquisite loveliness that, once read, will change the reader's perspective forever.  It is a book to refer to again and again as life unfolds and offers new opportunities for spiritual growth and awareness.It is a book I have given as a gift to many young people as they grapple with the frustrations and distortions of an often incomprehensible outer world.  It is a book of beautiful truths and a map to our own seeking souls.  I particularly love this edition which includes Gibran's original drawings."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have been reading The Prophet every year for over a decade. Or intending to. It's an incredible read. If I'm having issues in my life, I read the section that relates to my problem and it helps clarify things somewhat. It is a divinely inspired piece of work, and can be read in one setting. There is pretty much nothing that he doesn't cover in the book that can't be related to your own life. I bought the ebook version so I could have easier access. It's a book for everyone."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I first became aware of Kahlil Gibran when I read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Ever since then, I have sought out his books.  The Prophet is my favorite.  Several of the  &quot;poems&quot; or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life.  The  book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others.  There is  barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on-love, marriage,  death and all of our own insecurities and doubts about people and life.  This would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough  time, or just has unanswered questions at a certain point in their lives.  The writing is lucid, insightful, and will be relevant for as long as time  goes on.The drawings add to an already great work.  At my favorite Lebanese  restaurant, I not only found good food-I thankfully found Kahlil Gibran."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is an amazingly beautiful book.  The writings are spiritual and absolutely beautiful.  They cover almost every aspect of life and provide inspiring, poetic and though-provoking words in answer to questions raised about them.  When my mother passed away, I read this book over and over again.  Many use the chapter on marriage as part of their wedding vows.  My daughter asked me to read that chapter to her and her husband as part of their wedding ceremony.  I cannot think of a better way to spend $10.00.  You will more than get your money's worth even if you only read one chapter in the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Gibran wrote the ultimate way of seeing life and living in it. the importance of each relationship. The book was written to be relatable to every reader, all the subjects are mondain. The availability of this book is a great advantage that I don't think people are aware of. It's an hour long to read, but a lifetime to understand, if you read it you'll remember it in every new life matter or relationship.Buy it and keep it on the shelve for reference, it's an answer to everything. and read it carefully."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My intention here is to comment on the quality of this reading, rather than the timeless content, the quality of which is well known.I very much enjoyed Paul Sparer's reading. I found his rich bass voice and eloquent style ideal for Gibran and very pleasing to listen to. Unlike another reviewer, I was not at all distracted by the music; in fact, I barely noticed it. Taste in such things is a personal issue, and for what it's worth, this reading very much suits my tastes."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The prevailing popularity of Gibran's PROPHET lies in only one secret: he writes his poems with readers in his mind. The compassionate poet I come to know through his lines, Gibran did not write to impress, shock or confuse but to communicate truth with highest poetic beauty. THE PROPHET addresses 27 essential subjects of life that concerns everyone - love, freedom, children, work, self-knowledge, friendship, time, beauty, death to name a few. I have this book for many years but this is a kind of poetry that ripens with time and each time you take a sip, it still surprises you with refreshing revelations. Also recommended are his less known books, A TEAR AND A SMILE, SAND AND FOAM and THE GARDEN OF THE PROPHET."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love the Prophet and tend to buy copies to give to people who may need it's message.  I don't ever loan mine out because it never comes back!  This book speaks on all matters human!  I've owned it since I was 14 and go back to it constantly.  I especially love the sections on children, love and marriage.  It's a wonder insightful read and I highly recommend it.  It's also rather spiritual which is lovely.  It's not like the bible, but easy to read and take in.  It can give you peace when you need it.  Please consider adding it to your library."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Like watching an Olympic athlete or listening to an accomplished singer reading Khalil Gibran is in many ways indescribeable.In that way, it's good that many of the other reviewers have tried to describe this book by giving anectodes of how it personally touched them.  But ultimately those anectodes are like the stories of people who've gone to some great vacation spot.Sure, they can tell you how they felt enjoying its weather or appreciating its beauty but such descriptions will never compare to you taking your own personal journey there.Because of the way this book is written, some of its passages will no doubt touch you more than others but it is beyond doubt that you will emerge touched and having that rare feeling of connecting with someone only through the medium of the printed word.I wish we could award more than five stars.  I wish it could be an infinity...for every heart touched by this wonderful, wonderful book."}

As graceful as Jesus' parables must have been when freshly spoken, without the distortion of time and culture and multiple translations.

This is the book that motivated me to learn how to underline and save notes, the Kindle equivilent of dog-earing my favorite parts.  (Somehow less satisfying than a dog-ear, but really easy to retrieve later.)Other books that have made it from the list to my shopping cart sit largely unread because they are just too much work.

Was it Myrtle's utter devotion that kept her there? Why was Potter there? Were they camp followers? Also, did Myrtle bear Georgie and his wife's children for them because the wife couldn't? Or am I dreaming? There seems so much allusion in this book and I feel dumb for not getting what the other reviewers are getting from it.

So I grabbed Master Georgie while on a business trip  and buried myself in its atmosphere. I don't think I've read anyone like  her. One of the reviewers here compared the experience to browsing through  a collection of photos, and that is true. Somewhat frustrating, though, is  that - as with aged photographs - you never quite get the feeling that you  know these characters or have their full stories. Maybe if Beryl Bainbridge  were sitting alongside me to fill in the gaps. Nevertheless, I'm ready to  plunge into another Bainbridge and am curious to know if anyone else has  favorites."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It is amazing how some writers can blather on for hundreds of pages and yet be barren of memorable phrase or image, yet how a select few demonstrate the maxim of &quot;less is more.&quot;  Beryl Bainbridge and  her most recent novel Master Georgie surely fall into this latter category.  Each chapter in this short (190 pages) novel takes its title from a  picture illustrating its contents.  This is an effective technique, as the  photographic image provides both a jumping-off point for Bainbridge's  particular scene and narrator (the novel is given from several points of  view) and a framing device for the scene. I look forward to more of her  fiction."}

It was that engaging.  I remember it took me hours, and then when my mom caught me still awake, I lied and told her I had just woken up.The point in that is that as a small child, I found this book so intriguing that I was reading, writing, and counting for fun, well past my bedtime.  As an adult, I love the wit.  As a parent, I love that I get to share the childlike love for it all over again.This is such a fun book with real learning potential too.  Love it."}

Always a delight, our kids would laugh at the silliness while learning a lesson about life. We started a great habit of reading two or three books before bed, and the kids loved them. Soon, they would memorize many of the phrases, beginning a lifelong passion for reading.Every kid should experience reading books by the Berenstains while growing up. The characters are well developed, the rhyming phrases help kids become enthusiastic about reading, and the messages about life make them think.  Bears On The Moon got my son and daughter asking questions about space and interested in the great beyond.  Combine this with other fun Berenstain Bear books and your kids will sit enthralled as you turn the pages. Highly recommended."}

Itani is a wonderful writer who gets inside each of these worlds and let the reader have his and her own experience. We become involved in the lives of her characters and we feel their joys and sorrows."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wanted to like this book, but I expected a lot, and found it a disappointment.  The first half about Grania's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective, even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling.  As far as the second half, I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI, and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions.  I didn't see how it added to the story at all, and at this point in the book I really wished I wasn't reading it, but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened, and I felt that the ending was a let down.  Mostly, I feel that this topic could have been really, really engrossing, new, and compelling, but the book's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat.  I won't recommend this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really enjoyed &#34;The Deafening.&#34;  I read it after reading another book by Itani which I really enjoyed.  Like most Americans I don't know as much about Canada as I should.  The novel grabbed my attention at the beginning and held it to the end.  It also made me feel so lucky that I have my hearing.  The scenes of the hardships of the men fighting WW1 were difficult to read, but that is war and I think it is something we all should think about."}

{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm going to be careful here, because I don't want to spoil anything for potential readers.  Let me just say it is a great book, sometimes disturbing, but often funny and charming, or filled with action.  It also has a good bit of grit and tenacity in the main character.  It is a look inside a unique community that you wouldn't get a chance to view this close if you weren't being \"escorted\" by  one of their own.  You may be tempted to stop reading at some point if you are an excessively tender soul, however hang in there.  All you need to know for now is this, it is a fresh well-written book that you will love and ends in a good way so, have no fear of it and enjoy."}

Overall, it was a journey, through hard times...but you know what? They made it, and will continue."}

I never really think this about a book but I kind of wish this book were longer. I wanted to know more about the key relationship that the author creates. She really could do another book with material I think she left out, like what happens next.I recommend this book, especially if you are looking forward to the movie with Reese Witherspoon, Robert Pattinson, and Christopher Waltz."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "In addition to writing an engaging story that offers a glimpse into a fascinating world foreign to most of us, Ms. Gruen shows herself to be a master \"architect\" with this novel, crafting a story that flows seamlessly between two radically different eras in her protagonist's life. The book starts with a flashback, so you know at some point it's going to bring us back to the opening scene. But Ms. Gruen does so in such a surprising and unexpected way, with a twist that left my jaw on the floor. It's not an exaggeration to say I was stunned.With Riding Lessons and Flying Changes, Ms. Gruen proved she was capable of writing good commercial fiction.With Water For Elephants, she proves herself capable of writing a great American novel."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've had this book for two years and only just read it last week.  Why did I wait so long???  This truely is a gem.  You feel like you know all the characters, and the ones you don't know so well are introduced with enough hints and inuendos that you can easily imagine their colorful pasts.  I fell in love with the elephant.  She brought a wonderfully odd twist to the story.And as for the author, I was half way through the book before I paid attention to the jacket picture and realised that it was a female. She wrote exactly as a man would tell the story.  The elderly Jacob was perfectly portrayed.  She has obviously been around very old people and knows how they act and react to all kinds of situations.I truely did not want the story to end."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is a love story set in a post depression traveling circus and told from the memory of 93 year-old man.  The story jumps between the current life of the narrator a uncontented man who believes he is 90 or 93 and his rememberance of the love story between Jacob and the Benzini Brother's circus.After the death of both his parents Jacob a veterinairian student finds himself penniless. Although not intentionally  he runs away to the circus where he finds love.This story give great historical flavor and is a must read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I am not by any means a reader or fan of \"Mainstream\" novels. My tastes tend to lean decidedly toward the stranger side of fiction (Little, PKD, Laymon, etc). But I decided, while strolling the aisle of my local Amazon store, after reading review after review that all but bowed before this title, to try it. I am so glad I did.I tore through this book, not wanting to leave Jacob stranded too long. I just \"couldn't put it down\", I know how terribly cliche' that is, but it is the absolute truth.This novel made me smile, which normally is a turn off for me... what a nice change of pace. Pick this book up if you haven't already. Sit down with Jacob and listen to his story, you'll smile too."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A friend recommended this book and I was thoroughly engulfed in it from the beginning. Such raw, real life and survival during the depression era. Jacob is a wonderful main character who is thrust into a world, grieving and desolate after his parents sudden death leaves him with nothing. The story is told by him as an old man of 90 or 93 as he says and is truly blunt on how our elders are treated in nursing homes and devalued as human beings. But, the wonderful, painful and thrilling story of his life, his love and his journey after his parents death lands him in a circus is spellbinding.Just know that the ending will make you smile and cry and feel joy for Jacob!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story takes place during the Great Depression.  It is a love story, but also a story about life with a traveling circus and all the rawness and crudeness that goes along with being part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth as remembered by Jacob Jankowski.  Normally, I'd much rather do my own reading, however David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones did an excellent job; the ninety-something-year-old Jacob was especially enjoyable.  When he read, I felt as if I were sitting next to him in the nursing home listening to his amazing story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First I must mention that I love books that take you to a time and place that you have no knowledge about and in this case it's circus life in the first half of the 1900's. It was fascinating to read what life was like in those days for those who worked in the circus, from performers to the labors. As for the book itself I did enjoy it, but I wouldn't call it a page turner and often in the first quarter of the book I thought about just putting the book down and starting something else a little more exciting to read. However the farther into the book I got the more I started to care about the characters the more invested in the book I became. In the end I was very glad I continued to read the book and now I can say I would recommend the book to friends."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a very beautiful, well-written story that at times had you really feeling - both good and bad feelings - for many of the characters. Jacob lived a hard life after his parents died but I appreciated his tenacity. He was determined to make it in the circus and to make it in life. I throughly enjoyed the ending and I think if I was Jacob that that's how I'd want to spend the rest of my days too. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a story about real life, struggles, love, loss, and hope."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I don't read fiction.  A snob journalist, I believe my time is better spent reading non-fiction. Due to reasons I won't bore you with, I picked this book up and thumbed through the first couple of pages, just to see if the writing was any good. I didn't put it down. Read it through to the finish. (The last time this happened with me and fiction was fifteen years ago with \"Boy's Life\" by Robert McCammon.)Sara is a wonderful storyteller with an engaging narrative style, and Jacob is a colorful character with whom to build a story around.So, if you're a non-fiction snob like me or a fiction addict like my wife, you can't go wrong with this book. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was extremely happy with every aspect of this book until, in one of the final chapters, when Uncle Al tells Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic, or as he puts it, a \"paragon schizophonic\".  After reading this, there seemed to me to be simply too many similarities with an older novel I read in 2006, William Styron's modern classic SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  A beautiful Catholic woman and a handsome Jewish man who fight a lot due to the man's schizophrenia, another younger man who is new to their 'group' who has feelings for the woman...sex...death...the only dfference seems to be the circus setting and the fact that in this, the woman DOESN'T die and ends up married to the new, younger man.  A nice book, but not extremely original, at least not in the romantic storyline."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is my new favorite book. Besides being a GREAT story, I feel like I have made many new and interesting friends.  Sara Gruen demonstrates a gift for characterization.  Each character transcends his/her strengths and weaknesses to portray the good, the bad and the ugly of circus life in the post-depression era.  She truly captured the mystique of \"running away to join the circus\" through her characterization.Jacob Jankowski's (the narrator & featured characher) sense of humor is priceless.  I found myself either chuckling out loud or squirming in disgust throughout his storytelling.I found the book difficult to put down; yet, I did not want it to end.If you don't read another book this summer, read this one.  You will experience a myriad of emotions--happiness, sadness, fury, longing, relief, distress, even enchantment. . ."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First of all, Sara Gruen tells a really good story. People and animals both have their moments. What most impresses me though is her ability to show the feelings and memories of an old man. Once old, we tend to forget that the old man in a nursing home was once a part of exciting and dangerous events.To me, the viewpoint and dialogue of Joseph at 90 (or 93) really makes this book.Give it a read.And now the point of the Audio review:  If you like the book then you will find the unabridged audio a real treat. The reader captures the characters and takes you right along. We have listened to the story twice and still appreciate the skill of the reader and the beauty of this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When I downloaded this book, I honestly didn't expect much more than a nice way to pass some time.  I really underestimate this little gem.  Once I picked it up I found it hard to put down.  In fact, I stayed up past my bedtime to finish it, but it was worth the extra cup of coffee I had to have the next morning.Without going into any details about the story itself (there's more than enough other reveiws to do that), I'll start by saying I was almost immediately endeared with the main charachters, which is a testament to the writing abilities of the author.  I laughed and cried with the characters, and was genuinely sad to see some of them go.While the ending was more than a little predictable, it was still a good read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is simply just a wonderful book!The characters are well defined, each and everyone of them!  You care, you like, you love, you hate!The story unfolds with Jacob, at 91 or 93...he is not sure, and his life.Schooled in vetinary science, he finds himself adrift after the loss of his parents and any financial stability.  He joins the circus and meets a cast of characterS like no other.His love for Marlena, his ultimate choices and growth...the paths taken...andThen...he is 91 or 93...just read it...I can't wait to see the movie...it will be magic!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "One of the most entertaining piece fiction I've read in the past 12 months. During post-depression era, the protagonist, Jacob, is left penniless after his parents' sudden death. Completely aimless, he jumps the first train he sees and literally lands in a circus train, plunging him head-first into a fascinating world filled with performers of all shapes and talents, a miserly ring-master, a beautiful horse trainer and a liquor-drinking/Polish-tongued elephant named Rosie.Sara Gruen does an incredible job of incorporating history and urban legends: paralysis that afflicted thousands from drinking \"Jake\", an alcohol substitute concocted during The Prohibition; the humongous dead hippo that was preserved in formaldehyde to fool thousands of viewers (pickled elephant).I highly recommend this book; just sit back and let yourself get lost in this strange and fascinating story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story line captivated me from the first chapter.  It had ALOT of swearing and graphic sexual content which I didn't enjoy having to wade through and skip over.  I didn't think it added anything to the storyline, and felt that it could have been left out all together.I found the author commentaries at the end to be most fascinating.  It was interesting to read that the story line has some non-fiction events weaved into it.  I you don't mind filthy language and sexual content this is a great read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Nothing about this book appealed to me.  Not the subject matter, nor the title, nor the cover.  Pfttt.....nothing. A depression-era traveling circus?  What could be more....depressing?  My sister delivered into my hands one day and said, \"Read it.\"  And I did.  I read it while cooking. I read it while eating.  I read it when I should have been sleeping.  I read and read and wanted to read more.  Now I hand it to you and say, \"Read it\".  You won't be sorry."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Maybe I'm missing the bandwagon (no pun intended), but all these reviews that say \"amazing\", \"best book I've ever read\", etc.??  I don't get that.  I was drawn to the story and the characters, and it was well-written.  It was an easy read, so I finished it in a day and a half.  However, I don't consider it anything more than a fun read--something good for the beach or the plane. I'm defintely not seeing the hype."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "An interesting way to showcase circus history & a way of life that is no more.Although this is a fictionalized account, it was based on bits & pieces of fact from Circus History.The photographs were the best.They were a nice addition to the book.The nursing home drama/tie-in was a bit too much.I guess it was a play on the theme of running away to join the circus...Just never heard of someone who ran away from a nursing home in a wheel chair to join the circus & was successful with it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants presents a story of a veterinarian's life told from both his present and earlier life perspective.  The way that the author switched between time periods was entertaining.  I found myself experiencing a wide range of emotions from horror to curiosity to anger and then to happiness.  I personally have never been to a circus so I don't have any memories of my own to go by.  However, the author's descriptions of the circus atmosphere and \"class\" system within the different groups makes it very easy to imagine just how life was living on that train traveling from town to town.  I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to the film version."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed this book a lot, despite the fact that some of the stuff said doesn't match the era in which it was written. I wasn't as bothered by the small issues as some of the other reviewers were, apparently. It is a work of fiction after all. Sure, there were quite a few cliches, but not to the point of distraction. I liked the animals and their personalities, namely Rosie, the star of the show. She stole my heart and when she was a victim of violence, my heart broke for her.Having the old man relive his memories of the circus was very compelling and tied the story of then and now together nicely. The ending made me cry, but not why you'd expect."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "With all the \"hype\" about this book, I was expecting more-more plot,and a more interesting main character. And really it reads like a script. So often the author does too much explaining about how each character is sitting, their reaction,etc. as if in preparation for a movie,with too much explaining how the actors should perform.I do like the depression era and the circus theme , which drew me to the book.I am looking forward to seeing the movie but mostly because of the actors in it.All in all I didnt care for the authors way of writing. But I think it will make for an interesting movie."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was suggested to me by a friend and I wasn't sure I would like it. As soon as I started reading I couldn't put it down.  In fact, I read it in about a week.  This particular book earned it's place on the New York Bestsellers list for a reason.An elderly man, looking back on the past and how it has shaped him now.  The book is set in the present day as well as the early 1930's.  It paints the picture of exactly what I would think a traveling circus would be during that time.  It is full of drama within in the reigns of the circus as far as the everyday workers, performers, and animals. From cover to cover the reader does not know exactly what to expect.  I would suggest this book to anyone.One of the best books I have read in some time.  I can't wait to see the movie!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I normally don't select bestsellers for reading pleasure; they so often disappoint. Had my book club not selected this for discussion I probably would not have read it. But I am so glad I did. The book is well writen, not just a good story, but excellent writer's craft. Any person over fifty with any empathy at all will identify with the story teller. Younger people will identify with the main characters in the circus story. I am not particularly interested in circus history, but this was fascinating. The ending is especially wonderful...fanciful but wonderful."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This really is an excellent book with an interesting story and well-conceived details.  I listened to the audio version, which was particularly well acted.  My complaint with the book is that it is blatantly anti-Jewish.  The circus leaders, who are described as Jewish, are mean and spiteful, making the lives of the workers a living hell.  Why did Ms. Gruen need to assign a religion to them? I found this really offensive, and played into negative Jewish stereotypes.  My other complaint with the book is that the two Jacobs don't seem like the same person (I'm assuming they are although I'm not quite finished with the book).  One is loving and mild-mannered, the other cantankerous and bitter.  Can these really be the same person?"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a book I cannot forget; it stirred me deeply.  Yes, the story telling is brilliant and extremely well written; the parts about the depression and the circus are fascinating; and the ability of a young female author to give voice and depth of character to an old man in his nineties is extraordinary (he is one of literature's most memorable characters!)But for me, there is something which surpasses even all of this.  Gruen touched on and developed a reality with which it is so difficult for most of us to come to grips: that is how the strong, virile, resourceful young man in his twenties continues to reside in the decrepit, rotting body of the stooped, weak old man.  She has drawn so clearly the ungraspable mystery of youth emerging into old age, the spirit of the person masked by the wrinkled cloak of the elderly.  Bravo, Sara.  Well done!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Like many who were critical of this book, I truly did want to love it. However, the writing was simple and flat, the characters lacked depth or conviction and the ending was a huge let down. Jacob was infuriating as he claimed to love these animals and then becomes sexually sidetracked while his Rosie was being beaten half to death. It made me sick to my stomach. Over and over, he continued to behave like a helpless child while this animal was brutalized. Time and again, he is either incredibly violent or he is impotent and seemingly defenseless. In the end, each conflict is suddently and hastily resolved with little authenticity. What a shame as this could have been a deeply moving and engaging story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "this author is a master story teller and she had me from the first.  The structure of the book is captivating, back and forth from the nursing home where the main character lives out his old age to the fascinating life he has led as a veternarian for the circus and his love affair with the main act.  and that is only the beginning.  It is the story of coming of age in a most unconventional setting.  I learned so much about the inner workings of a circus.  So why oh why did the author end the book on such a maudlin, unrealistic note.  Sarah Gruen forced a happy ending on a story that deserved a more intelligent finale.  Still it is deffinately worth the read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished reading Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.  It was one of my most favorite reads to date, and I read alot of books!  I loved how the book started in the nursing home with the older Jacob and how he reveiled how it felt to be old and most of the time forgotten.  His family viewed it as a duty to go and visit him..And then it switches to a young Jacob and tells the story of his adventures working in a circus.  For anyone who wanted to run away to the circus as a child, you will definately love this book.  I could not put it down. It is exciting one minute and has you on the edge of your seat and the next it is endearing and makes you feel like you really know the characters.  I give this book 5 stars and if you want a really good read, you will do the same."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "After \"Riding Lessons\", which I loved - and \"Flying Changes\", which was a huge disappointment to me, I was not sure what I would find in \"Water for Elephants\".  Wow - what a great read!  Research does pay off hugely - when it enables a writer to place the reader inside another world so easily - the world of the circus. This was a world totally foreign to most of us - but now, so familiar, thanks to Sara.  This book satisfied my three requirements - transportation (take me away from all this),  levitation (lift my spirits and leave me thinking good thoughts) and infiltration (let me get inside the characters so I feel I really know them). Reading \"Water for Elephants\" is time well-spent.  I'm happy to know Sara is working on a fourth book. I'll be first in line to buy it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was a bit hesitant about reading this book, I kept reading that it was about circuses, and I really didn't think I had too much of and interest. Boy was I wrong. It starts with a murder and winds and weaves you through the story of life in the traveling circus and back to present day in a nursing home.  The book had my attention from page one and still has me even though I finished reading it. There is humor, love, murder, and friendship, and a whole lot of history about the circus, and circus life making this book a well rounded engaging read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a well-written, cute story.  I certainly achieved the `suspension of disbelief' that one looks for in a summer novel.  I empathized with the main character, and could picture him and the others.  I feel like I know Jacob Jankowski - both the younger version in shock from losing his parents, and the older version who hates being treated like an \"invalid\".  Unlike some reviewers, I am not old enough to remember the circus coming to town on the train and with a parade.  In fact, the circus experience from my childhood was in a large concert venue.  Nevertheless, Gruen allows me to imagine the big top in all of its grimy glory and picture all of the alcohol loving workers and performers smuggling their drinks on the train.  What a nice escape."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Seeing Jacob young and old, and hearing how time affected him, and how he still remained connected to his history after all those years was  great. It really added to the book and really tied the story together for me. It was very dramatic for me to see how this once active and interesting man was effected by the years, and what age does to a person. It made me think how we cast aside many of our elderly friends and folks not paying attention to their stories. Especially key when thinking alone about Jacob's past. I have a great love and respect for elephants and at many times i was so angered in the story and could feel the emotions that Jacob was experiencing. It was such a strong event that occurred with Rosie, and without giving the story away was vindicating. Really don't want to watch the movie now as afraid would not live up to how i imagined everything or if they changed the story too much."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "So much has already been written about the shallow characters and implausible ending... So no need to belabor that point.However, I do want to throw up a Red Flag to those readers who, like me, aren't big fans of profanity. I listened to Water for Elephants on CD and found myself cringing repeatedly at the author's liberal use of the F-word. (And many other words.) Furthermore, the graphic sexuality felt like the author's attempt to titillate and shock her readers with needless cheap thrills. She provided ample details regarding the sexual habits of her characters whilst omitting more relevant ones regarding central relationships and motives.There was an interesting storyline in there somewhere. As to the rest, it could've been toned down."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Seldom has a book moved me as much as this one did.  Perhaps it's because I listened to the audiobook version, and the narrators voices were perfect for the different stages of life in the book.  Perhaps it's because my 98 year old mother-in-law is in a nursing home, but the author captured what life for a 90+ year old must be like in a nursing home facility.  In addition, I LOVE the circus, even though today's pale in comparison to those that were under canvas.  Without doing a spoiler, I can only say that it's been a long time since the ending of a book brought tears to my eyes.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was really impressed by this book. It's an old man's retelling of his younger days at a circus. He's currently in a nursing home. What's amazing is how she takes you inside his head and causes you to see events through his eyes, and his mind. You feel his frustration, his loneliness, and how he's misunderstood.Older people in the home are treated like children, but inside, they're cognizant, at least some of the time, and resent this treatment, but are helpless to prevent it.The details in the circus era are very well written. You're taught a lot about circus life, the fun, the dangerous, the dark underbelly. Maybe it's not representative; it is fiction, but you believe it. She takes you there.One of the most enjoyable fiction books I've read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT I READ THIS BOOK.  I HAVE OBSERVED PEOPLE READING THIS BOOK ON AIRPLANES, IN CARPOOL LINES, SITTING ON A BENCH AT BARK PARK, SO I DECIDED IT WAS A MUST READ JUST TO FEEL LIKE I BELONGED IN A SOCIETY.  THE BOOK IS INTERESTING, PARTICULARLY IF YOU WERE FASCINATED WITH THE CIRCUS AS A YOUNG CHILD.  I FOUND THE ANIMAL BRUTALITY A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO READ, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT AS BRUTAL AS I HAD ANTICIPATED, BUT WHAT I DID MOSTLY REMEMBER AT THE END.  IT'S A GOOD READ, NOT A GREAT READ.  THE ONLY FLAW I WOULD MENTION IS THE NARRATOR'S VOICE WAS NOT PLAUSIBLE AS A NINETY YEAR OLD MAN.  THE AUTHOR MIGHT HAVE DONE A LITTLE RESEARCH IN THAT AREA, BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM READING THE BOOK."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was pleasantly surprised by this story.  Granted, it had wonderful reviews here on Amazon, but there have been other popular fiction novels with the same reviews, and I loathed those books.I don't need to go into any details as the book has been so thoroughly reviewed, but I will say there was so much in the book that touched me.  Ninety or ninety-three year old Jacob's story was so emotional...it's going to stay with me for quite awhile.  Bravo!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wish that I could say that I was one of the readers of  Water For Elephants, the well researched novel by Sara Gruen, who was graciously transported to the circus world of the 1930's, but sadly I can't.I am not one who acclaims the romance of  the beautiful Marlena, the circus horse rider and Jacob, whose personal tragedy causes him to walk away from his final exams at Cornell Vet school.  Instead, I am left thinking that perhaps, I should have read Twilight instead.  The an essential problem of reading a romance in which the reader does not care for the romantic protagonists, is that it takes the heart out of the book.Though there was enough in the side characters, animals and atmosphere to carry the book but alas there I often found Gruen's phrasing annoying and clunky.  I have decided in all fairness to Ms Gruen and her many fans that I will desist from reading any more of her works and we shall all continue on quite happily."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed this book very much.  Full of detail and things I would have never suspected or imagined about a circus.  I must admit that I had some trouble with the scenes of animal (and even people) abuse but was able to skim quickly over it enough to get the picture but not dwell on it.  I know that this part of the book had to be told because I'm sure that it happened.  I did enjoy the animals (and people) revenge at the end greatly!  I especially loved the weaving of Jacob's story from old man to young and back again.  And of course the happy ending...well who could have asked for a better one.  Yep!  I loved this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My title for my book review is lifted from the editorial reviews, Valerie Ryan really nailed it for me.There are so many things to like about this book.  The very best thing is the firm grounding in historical fact.  This is what it was like in America during the Great Depression, this is why the travelling circus roustabouts worked and lived the way they did, because of the Depression.  They didn't always get paid but at least they ate.  Sara Gruen handles her historical data with an exceedingly light touch, she is a marvellous storyteller.  Memorable book, very engaging. I can understand why there are nearly four thousand reader reviews."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had planned on watching the movie first because it looked good and  I can't usually watch a movie and enjoy it if I read and enjoyed the book first and vis versa. However, the book got better reviews than the movie and I didn't want to taint my experience with the story, so I picked up the book first and I'm glad I did.We are deliver the story through Mr. Jacob Jankowsky's ninety, or ninety-three year old memory. He can't remember his age but he remembers his life with the train traveling circus in the 1930's like it was yesterday. We see the excitement of a life as a circus worker and more often then not the dangers that the job presents, especially if you start to fall for the crazy jealous circus trainer's wife."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have owned this book for a few months. I keep getting side tracked by other books so I did not read it. Last week so many people told me how wonderful the book was and even the movie. SO, I picked it up last night and am almost done with it. WOW!!! What a wonderful story. You can tell a lot of research went into this by the accuracy. While I know very little about circus life I do work with the elderly and that is all accurate. A lot on the lines of \"The Notebook\" the way the story in told."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is loaded with interesting words because Sara Gruen owns a commanding vocabulary, and utilizes her well-chosen words with precision.  She also understands how to set the hook and carefully reel her reader in.  She's a master angler.The story is entertaining and the setting--a train circus-- is interesting.  Obviously Gruen heavy research is what birthed the rich detail.While some call this a romance book, the romance is lacking and rushed.  This is more of an action-adventure \"who done it.\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My hatred for this book knows no bounds. This is the trashiest thing to infiltrate the literature section of the bookstore since Henry Miller. (Although I'm not a Henry Miller expert, I'm guessing he at least brought some literary merit to the table, which is more than I can say for this author!) The depression-era circus setting, although intriguing, was not enough to make up for the endless vulgarity, flat characterization and vapid dialogue. And, to make matters worse, no character, at least from the ones I can remember, is spared horrific scenes of physical abuse - you name it, woman, worker, elephant, dog, clown. I just got tired of it all after a while.Why did I even bother to finish it? It was sort of like watching Ripley's Believe it or Not to see what kind of ghastly thing would happen next. Well now I believe it; this is one of the worst contemporary books I've read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Not going to lie, I bought this so I could read it before the movie came out (Robert Pattinson fan :-P).  While it was an easy read, I didn't love it. I found it difficult to appreciate the circus life with the description of it, but the characters were interesting.  The ending surprised me, so I loved that!  Nothing worse than a predictable novel.  There were many endearing and HUMAN situations and characters of the novel, so I found myself rooting for some characters and hating others.  Not every book I read invokes that kind of emotion in me.This story is a some-what of a page turner and (again) an easy read, but there was some kind of disconnect.  I can't quite define what was missing from this book, but I think it's worthwhile.  Would be great for a book club."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a pleasurable book to read.  Among its many virtues, is Guren's recreation of the atmosphere of depression era America, and a unique circus subculture that existed in what now must be viewed as the lost past.  Leading this tale is a genuinely likeable guy, a rarity in contemporary literature.  This hugely popular book is without serious lessons to preach or meaning to convey.  Rather, it is a good story which provided me with many hours of pleasant diversion."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I found this book to be a very touching story with an interesting setting. The time period, the place, and the characters come to life in this wonderful story.  I don't want to give too much away but if you enjoy a book that makes you feel as though you are there...this is one!  There were times while reading this I wanted to throw a few punches, and other times I wanted to stand between August & Rosie, and times I just wanted to pat the hand of the older Jacob.  I'm sorry I finished this book...I will miss these characters."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Wow.  This book was just spectacular.  I tore through it (it grabbed me and would not let go).  How many books do you see a fifteen-year-old (my niece) reading while walking up stairs?  She could not stop reading it to climb the stairs!  It was an amazing ride.  I cannot imagine that ANYONE would not love this book.I read two of Sara Gruen's earlier books and this is in a different category - a tour de force, an absolute must-read.  What a lovely book.  You end up feeling grateful to her for writing it just so you could read it.  I cannot say enough about how great this book was - an enthralling story, enthrallingly told, absolutely marvelous."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When Jacob Jankowski's parents died in an automobile accident, he was just about to become a Veterinarian.But, with that shock, and the shock of finding out that his parents didn't leave him the financial comforts that he had thought were there, Jacob, didn't take his last college exam.  And, he wondered into the life of a circus, where he learned a great deal about the human condition and about animals.During these tough Depression Era days, he lived in filth, but the animals meant a great deal to him.  So, he applied what he had learned at Cornell University Veterinarian School, to protect the animals, and anyone who he loved.This book was a story about love, loss and finding what matters most to you, when you've loss what seemed to be all that mattered."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "No, I won't forget WATER FOR ELEPHANTS any time soon. The prologue is one of the best I've read in a long time. I actually called a friend and ready it to her out loud. The characters, in particular, Rosie the elephant and Jacob are accurate and tender, each in their own sometimes sad and poignant way. This book is a summer hit for a reason--it's an enjoyable read filled with the peculiarities of circus life that intrigue and woo all who are drawn to such a menagerie known as the \"Greatest Show on Earth.\" ~Carol D. O'Dell"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved the first 90% of this book.  Whenever I opened it to read, I fell right into circus life in the 1930s, as told by the 93-year-old main character looking back on his life of 70 years previous.  My complaint is that the ending seemed rushed and contrived.  There were lose ends that didn't make sense.  For all of the reality of the first part of the book, the end seemed too fantastic.  Did the editor say \"Wrap it up all ready!\"?  I think this would make a TERRIFIC movie--just wait for the rights to be sold.  A good summer read, too."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book surprised me.  I usually don't read the summaries on the book jackets because I find that it spoils the story for me and so I didn't really know what to expect from this book.  However, by the end of the book, I was thoroughly fulfilled.  I loved the author's insight into seeing things from the perspective of the \"90 or 93 yo\" main character.  I found I couldn't put the book down once started.  I also liked the Q&A commentary at the back of the book telling how the author researched circus life - especially the story about Rosie - to include in the novel.  Great storytelling!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I couldn't put this book down. I have seen the awards it won, but never thought about getting it, I wondered who this Sara Gruen is, never read her books. SO I didn't go out of my way to pick it up. Somebody brought it in to work. We have a bookshelf full of books that we share. I saw it and thought, OK, now I am going to read that, it is here, I keep seeing it, I am taking the plunge!How wonderful. I was completely and totally into the book after reading the first 4-5 pages. I couldn't put it down. I loved it, this isn't my type of book normally. However, it is a great read. I felt like I was standing next to the big top through the whole book. Get it, read it and enjoy it, that is the purpose of this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book. I'd been hearing so much about it prior to the film that I decided I had to read it. No one had really told me what the book was about so I was more than pleasantly surprised at the subject matter. I have always had an interest in the Great Depression and riding the Circus Train during that time period with Jacob was one of the best trips of my life. Sara Gruen's writing is descriptive and made me feel like I was actually involved in the lives of her characters. It was an easy read but a cause for dismay when it ended. I wanted it to go on and on. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who just enjoys a good story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen delivers a readable tale that's a tad too formulaic to be fully engaging. In the same way that the narrator of the story insists from personal experience that it is impossible to carry enough water to slake an elephant's thirst, I'd insist that this container doesn't hold enough water to satisfy a serious reader.Also noted: the description of animals and animal behaviors is approximately cartoony, and takes away from the whole.On the flip side, it is an easy read that won't occupy more than an evening and Gruen does offer up some fascinating historical details about old-style railroad circuses, which altogether comes off as plausibly true."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Frankly, all of the good things have been said about this book by other reviewers. I can only thank Public Radio that had a review of it. Otherwise I would not have heard of it.One of the things that the book points out is how tough life was during the depression.  American today have no concept of what it was like for people who earned no money, had no money, and had no place to go. There were no homeless shelters, no social security.  It was a different world.Gruen does a great job of showing the read the America of the Depression years and also tells a wonderful story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm usually drawn to books written about the depression era, as I have heard so much about it from my parents.  This book is not only that, but a great insight to the circus life during that time.  I had a hard time putting this book down in the evenings (after a day at work), and it was good timing that my spouse was out of town for the week.  Very well written, a great story, and a page turner. I'll be buying copies for future gifts."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Loved this book.  It portrays the life of survival of humans and animals alike.  It has always amazed me how elephants put up with us ignorant humans and our slow mentality in catching on as to how to treat them according to their abilities. The fact that elephants haven't done away with all evil handlers is a testament to the amazing personality, patience and attitude of their creation. The circus realm has a lot of shame, guilt and blame placed at its feet. Even though this is a fictional story, the real stories of circus elephants is much worse and a hard read.  I'm looking forward to another place in time where all will live in peace with all living things as this great earth was intended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Can a stint of a few months in a circus change a boy's life forever? Yawn. The novel is peopled with cut-outs: a diligent country boy orphaned the day before his final exams; an ethereally beautiful horse-tamer with a secret problem (a loutish husband); perverted dwarves; whores with golden hearts; etc. Retold from a retirement home, the novel seems prepped for cinematic treatment, and doesn't linger in literature. It hurtles towards a pre-ordained resolution: the match made in heaven, in the book, and a movie contract for the author. Boo."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I don't know why I picked up this book to read, but I'm glad I did!  All summer, I've become bored with other books I've attempted to read but abandoned half way through.Water for Elephants was different.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down.  The author did a great job developing the characters and the story.  I didn't know much about circus life and the story gives the reader a good glimpse of what it was like.  Because I'm an animal lover, I liked how the main character looked out for well being of the circus animals.I recommend this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Im usually skepical when it comes to reading a book that has become a movie . I end up either loving the movie and not liking the book or loving the book and not liking the movie. THIS book was stunning in detail and takes the reader into the 'Big Top' in such detail that you can almost smell the peanuts! It contains violence but it is told with such skill that the reader understands just how brutal humans can be ....but the main character is the hero and does make a difference . As for the romance...its innocent and well written. There is something for all in this story and I see now why it was made into a movie. I have not seen it yet but I can only imagine !"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed reading about the history of the circus and the anecdotes shared by Sara Gruen.  It takes you back to an age of innocence in your life where the Circus was pretty close to the best thing that ever happened to you.  The elephants and the brave ladies that rode on them.  The clowns and the ittle people.  I enjoyed recreating those memories while reading this delightful and sweet account of two circus runaways who fall in love.  Their story was predictable in so many ways.  The old Jacob part was just sad and it left a sour feeling.  However, I did enjoy reading about the circus people and their lives.  The parades and the drama behind the curtain.  The roustabouts working so hard and sleeping in crowded spaces,yet what an adventure! to travel around the country from town to town brining smiles to millions and enjoying the camradie of the circus!  I loved that part."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished listening to this audio book and I have to say it was truly wonderful.  I felt the circus come alive, great imagery and historic detail.  You could picture the circus`s shows with great detail.  I listened to this while commuting and found myself really enjoying my drive to and  from  work, traffic and all. The only negative was the sex.  My tween daughter really wanted to read this book because of the movie trailer but I had to say no right away after just the first chapter or so.  It really didn't add that much to the story and wasn't needed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My book club chose this book in the spring.  I decided not to read it at that time, despite the wonderful reviews.  Last week I picked it up to read while we were lounging at the cabin.  Wow!  What took me so long?This is one of the finest stories I've read in a long time.  It grabbed me in the beginning and pulled me through to the end.  It had a bit of everything---humor, adventure, romance, heartbreak.Water for Elephants is the story of a young man who accidentally joins a circus train in 1931.  Along with him we meet some wonderful characters---both human and animal.Spoiler Alert---I enjoy a story with a happy, yet satisfying ending.  This book did not disappoint."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished \"Water for Elephants\" the day before yesterday!  I can't seem to find anything I want to read now as that story just won't go away.  It was far and beyond one of my favorite books.  I just loved it!  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  Now I want to see more pictures of the old circuses.  Amazing what she was able to capture with her words and that she could understand what an old man could be feeling and thinking.  I love it when I can find a book like hers.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "At first I was skeptical about reading a book about a circus, but everyone I know that has read the book had given it great reviews.  I'm glad to say I was not disappointed.  The author did a great job with this book and detailing the era in which it is written.  I bought this book on my Kindle and can honestly say I could not put it down - the convenience of having my Kindle books available through apps on my cell phone / computer and the actual Kindle made it even harder to put down and all the more exciting to read.  I highly recommend this book, it did not disappoint in any way!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Yes, this story reads like a script and I was interested in the characters.....however I thought the terrible things that happen was just too much.  Reading about the terrible things that happen to animals, the perverted things that carnies do, it was just too much - I wanted to erase that stuff from my brain the moment I read it.  That is just not entertaining to me at all.  I really did enjoy how the book tied \"what happened\" from the beginning to the end, very nicely.  That was very interesting to me and I'm glad I finished it.  I could do without all the other crap though."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This books was one of my favorites for the year. This book flashes from present day Jacob, 93 living in a nursing home to Jacob's summer traveling with the circus during the 1930's Depression era. Not only do you have these rich circus characters and animals, but also you have the interesting time period. The writing is flawless, the characters/animals (Rosie, my favorite) are amazing, the plot keeps you interested, and you root for the Jacob in the past and his present condition.The slight twist in the whodunit revealed near the end was also suprising"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really enjoyed reading this book. I had to do so through tears most of the time. I really loved the way she wrote the story from both perspectives of Jacob as a young man and as an old man. It helped it mean more to me to read about it from his memory. It reminded me of what treasures we have in our elderly. I also loved to see all the old pictures, they were great. On the down side of the book there was more then needed sex and bad language in the story for me. But that's just me. I do like the book and am very glad I read it. I would suggest it to other adults to read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "'Water for Elephants' provides an insiders peek behind the curtain of a traveling train circus. Anyone who ever went to a circus and played the games on the midway are rubes wanting to be thrilled, enchanted and take leave of reality for a day. The illusion lasts about as long as cloud of cotton candy. The inside story delves into the darker aspects of what makes the circus viable especially during the 1930's Depression era. The reader is introduced to a strict caste system from bosses to performers to roustabouts that determines one's position among a long train of characters. The practice of 'redlighting' is  particularly powerful, a Darwinian, survival of the fittest practice where the circus bosses have the used up roustabouts tossed from the train as excess baggage. Our hero is Jacob Jankowski that over the course of  only 3 1/2 months joins the circus. As a veternarian he does not fit into the caste system. Through his character we take a journey making allies with unlikely people, finding love and slaying personal deamons."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story, about a young man who runs away to the circus, is beautiful in the way it paints an older man near the end of his life in a loving, endearing way. Older people are real people whose value is in no way diminished. In fact, they have lived their life and survived life's most difficult challenges. And yet despite all they've learned and know, they are given so little respect. Every day they courageously cope with challenges that most of us have never even come close to experiencing. Even their family often treats them callously, or worse, like little children. Some older folk are cranky, like the character in this story, but considering what they've been through, they deserve kindness in return, not defensiveness. The treatment of this older man by nurse Rosemary in this book has inspired me to love older people and respect them more."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I knew very little about this book before I read it. I didn't know quite what to expect; but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It certainly wasn't as good as The Kite Runner or other great books I've read (thus why I didn't give it five stars), but it was still a very good story. I would easily recommend it to others. The author creates a rather fantastic situation - a Cornell veterinary student who suddenly finds himself a penniless orphan during the Great Depression. The story takes us to a circus train, a love triangle, and an elephant. Gruen weaves a wonderful tale that I found captivating, told both in the present and the past. In the meantime, I learned a great deal about circus life in the 1930s."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This novel is a rambling, disjointed and thoroughly annoying depiction of a highly forgettable era in Amercan history.  The characters are flimsy, the plot is circuitous and the endless stories of animal cruelty are downright depressing.  Perhaps the one saving grace is the author's use of Jacob's character as an elderly man who is looking back on his life with hindsight.  I cannot believe there has been such a fuss about this book and that someone was foolish enough to make it into a film.  Now that will be a real flop!  If I ever see this author's name again I will move away from it as quickly as I am able.  This was just a terrible book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a great story line, but I really get disgusted with the writers that think they have a free license to use the Lord's name in vain. It has become a disgusting passtime and all too prevalent &#34;thing to do&#34;.  And why do they do it? It adds nothing to the story. Just a disgusted feeling and sorrorful feeling for the author. It shows how the people of the world are falling away from God. That is one thing I miss with my Kindle, I always use a black marker and mark out that word from the sentences or stop reading the book altogether."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "One day I was surfing Amazon looking for a good read. There are times when I'm looking for something different that I just go with a good title. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised, other times I'm not. This was a pleasant surprise. I'd never heard of the book or the author so I came in on a clean slate. It was a wonderful read, one of those books you hate to put down for mundane things such as work and sleep. I was instantly hooked on the main character, Jake, and the life he led. Sad in spots, dark and violent in some places, bittersweet at times, it was one of those stories that pulled me right in and made it hard to say goodbye when it was over."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For several years, various animal rights organizations have campaigned against circuses, citing the cruelty inflicted upon animals.  Gruen shows how cruelty permeated the institution.This is a wonderful novel about love and decadence, greed and control, and cruelty and tenderness.  It starts weakly, where the protagonist discovers his parents were killed in a freak traffic accident.  He hops a train, and winds up working for a circus.  But don't despair, I promise it's worth finishing.Gruen's characters are vividly drawn.  Hierarchies amongst performers, workers and management prevail.  Descriptions are so vivid, you can almost smell the hay, and everything else so accurately described.This is a wonderful window into life in a circus, with all it's horrors and despite them, it's draw.Well done!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love the novel, Water for Elephants. It is the exciting tale of a young, veterinary student who ends up working for a third-rate, somewhat corrupt, traveling circus. He cares for the circus animals, while encountering danger, episodes of animal cruelty, violence and romance. It is a heart-pounding and endearing tale, told mostly in flashback.  The characters are larger-than-life, from the cruel circus owner, to the sideshow freaks, to the bawdy young ladies who perform for the grinning men - both onstage ... and off. I just loved this book from start to finish. And for those of you who have seen the film, the book has much more action, and less focus on the romantic angle. An action-packed, colorful story. I could not put it down."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was born in 1920.  I grew up during the Great Depression and the Prohibition eras.In 1965 we owned a bait and tackle shop in Venice, Florida.  At that time the Ringling Bros. Circus wintered there and we became acquainted with many circus people.  Our shop was a hangout for them and every evening after rehearsals they would stop by for a beer.The book: \"Water for Elephants\" is extremely well written and I am planning to read more of Sara Gruen's work.I have ordered two more copies and given them to friends.  They have given me very good reports."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As a prize-winning author myself, and a Pulitzer nominee, I know good writing.  This book was so riveting and fascinating I couldn't put it down.In fact, it became so real to me that I began to think of it as non-fiction some time after I'd finished.  I had to read these reviews to recollect it is fiction.  Having read a great many of the posted reviews, I can't help noticing the negative or low rated reviews are sneering and superior, and critical in the extreme.  This is, in my experience, typical of poor writers who feel compelled to comment scathingly on others' skills, but who are incapable of writing compelling literature themselves.  As a professional academic reviewer, I strongly disagree with the snide commentary.  It is a rare gem."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was hesitant to read this book at first because I was concerned about the animal abuse. However, Sara Gruen did a wonderful job with keeping it at a minimum. I quickly scanned over one or two of the scenes and then realized when I was done reading the story, how the little bit of it added to the story.Well researched and well defined, Gruen takes you by the hand and leads you into the life of an elderly man who, from a nursing home, reflects back on his life in his younger years while he was a part of the circus life. Vivid and captivating, I felt as though I was a part of this exciting journey.There are thousands of reviews on this book, so I'll keep mine brief. Clearly stated, this is one work that will remain in my memory all the days of my life. Fascinating!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book does provide a fairly riveting story set within post depression America and also provides good insights into the circus business during this era. The book balances the dynamics of maintaining a circus in tough economic times against a host of vivid and disparate personalities that can both support and challenge the stability of the circus. For example there is Big Al who runs the circus with a nearly ruthless practicality, \"redlighting\" individuals who violate his rules. There is August, second in command, alternately tough and gracious, supportive and cruel. There is Jacob, the hero, who stumbles into the world after fleeing Cornell Vet School and who subsequently falls in love with August's wife. The book alternates between the young Jacob in the circus and the elderly Jacob in a nursing home. Some of the dialogue the characters use during the depression era sounds like it came from the 21st century but other than that there is a gritty, often grotesque and unblinking realism in everything from death to romance."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was skeptical of a book detailing life in a traveling circus.  But overall this was an entertaining and well written book.  There were a few things that didn't flow well or weren't really explained (or at least I didn't understand them) like why Jacob was so outraged at the gentleman who said he had worked at the circus or for what reason Marlena was throwing a suprise for her husband (that ended up going poorly).  But these uncertainties didn't stop me from enjoying the story.  Surprising twist.  Sweet ending."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "90-ish Jacob Jankowski narrates his story in flashbacks from a nursing home. His days with the circus feel more real and alive to him than his current reality.After his parents are killed in a car accident, Jacob runs out on his vet school exams and joins the circus. Circus life is not always easy, but Jacob has experiences with humans and animals that change his life forever.Gruen brings the Depression-era circus vividly to life, along with its many colorful characters. If Rosie the elephant and Bobo the orangutan don't touch your heart, it's made of stone!Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants took a little while to fully grab my attention, with the flash backs between the circus and Jacob's time in the nursing home.  Once it got my attention it held it right through to the very end.There were a few relationships that stood out in my mind.  The first was between Rosemary and Jacob.  Their relationship exemplified the relationship I would hope all nursing home staff had with the residents.  Her understanding and patience as Jacob flashes back and forth between the present day and his youth is remarkable, and her connection seems to surpass the bond he shares with his children.I never would have thought I would enjoy a book that centered around the cicus, but this novel was about so much more than just the shows under the big top.  It focused on love, friendship, aging and compassion."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book because my sister-in-law (who never reads) could not put it down until she finished. So I gave it a go and, after a slow start, was interested enough to finish. The author does everything she can to exploit the reader's concern for cats, dogs, monkeys and, of course, the titular elephant. The narrator  is a vet who sticks with the circus, at first, in order to protect the animals, but he does little to interfere with their mistreatment... or the mistreatment of his fellow humans. In that sense, the book rings false. The book exploits the reader's feeling for animals and animal-human relationships for some cheap emotional effect. And it worked on me to some extent because I  cared about (and shed shed tears for) the animals much more than the humans. But I fail to see larger point."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I agree with several other people who found it amazing that this is a bestseller. As an author whose books sell poorly right here on Amazon, I wish I knew her secret. I found it disgusting on so many levels, hard to follow, and in the end, just not worth reading. Perhaps something in the last third of the book would have changed my mind, but I couldn't finish it. I can't remember the last time I threw a book into the garbage can, but I looked it over carefully, thought about the very act of throwing out a book, and then dropped it into the trash. I don't regret it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What an enjoyable book!  The plot, although at times a little predictable, was refreshing and well written.  I fell in love with Jacob young, but especially Jacob old.  His frustration with the tricks his body and mind had played on him were real and understandable.  His joy at the end of the book put a grin on my face. I know there have been quite a few of you who found the profanity excessive and gratuitous, but I think it fit the station of life and the time period and would not let it stop me from a book this enjoyable.  I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially those of you who find the time period of the 30's facinating."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Watched the film first and loved it. The book didn't disappoint either. Even though I had watched the film it was an interesting read, it didn't feel boring to read what I've already seen. The characters's good, I especially liked Walter and some other of the minor roles, the rhythm of the writing flowing and easily read. Jacob's tone and style of talking is well carried through the book. It feels like you're there. It was also fascinating to get glimpses of his current, old life. What he had become after all of the adventures, an old man forgotten by his children and family, reliving his past. It was sad, and you could understand his grumpiness.There's just something about circuses that's fascinating. It was interesting to \"learn\" how the circus worked in the 30s, how they travelled by train, how the hierarchy was arranged, how you lived your life in a circus."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you are like me, you're wanting to read the book before the movie comes out in a few weeks.  I've heard about this book for months, but I never could bring myself to buy it.  A favorite actor of mine is in the movie, so I finally decided to read it.  I am sorry I waited so long to do so!  It's one of the best books I've ever read.  The author's words are so well-written and descriptive, they paint pictures in your mind.  GET THIS BOOK if you want a heart-warming, and at times, thrilling read!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had some idea of the content of this book before I started reading, but was extremely impressed with the author's skill in opening the world of the Depression-Era circus, and the fascinating people who populated it.  Her ability to shift between the poignant situation of the aged Jacob, and the youthful enthusiasm and passion of the youthful Jacob made this novel 'work' better than most I've read in years.  The ending did catch me by surprise, and was absolutely delightful in all respects.  I will commend this book to the attention of anyone who wants to look through a window on the past, and the believable people who occupied that world -- told in the words of a very gifted author."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It's been a long time since a novel about circus life has been published, and this excellent book certainly makes up for all of those missing years. It is a well told tale that is, in part, humorous, tragic, romantic and heartbreaking. The book uses the same narrative device as \"Little Big Man\", that is, a very old gentleman remembering the exciting and adventurous days of his youth, and the circus he accidentally joined. The characters are extremely well drawn, even the minor ones, and I'm sure that the author spend many days delving into circus lore to get the details correct. Being of Polish descent, I enjoyed the fact that the protagonist was Polish, and I was taken back to my grade school days when a character began reciting the \"Our Father\" in Polish! It amazed me that, after all of these years, I could still read and pronounce those words correctly. This is simply a wonderful novel, and I highly recommend it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I get the creeps when I think of circuses from the mid 1900's. That was one of the reasons I put off reading this book even though I bought it quite some time ago. Eventually I just had no more unread books left and too long for my paycheck to arrive. I picked it up and barely put it down. I really got me hooked from the start and despite my despise of circuses I really liked it. I do think Gruen could have made Marlena more alive in the story. To me, she was just a beautiful girl. Her character never seemed to gain any life. But I especially cared for Jacob and the looking back of the old Jacob. It got me thinking of life, nursery homes and love.  You might even say it moved me. It didn't cure me though - circuses still gives me the creeps!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story is lovely and you cannot put it down. I read every word from cover to cover. There are also authors notes, an interview with Sara Gruen, and questions for book group discussions.Now back to my title for review. So many of you gave the story away you should not rethink your reviews. Thank G-d, I had already chose to read this book when I read Riding Lessons. I had never read one review on this book before I bought it. I wonder what goody Sara has for us next. It will be fun as long as I stay away from reviews!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "He's 90 or 93 he doesn't really remember and it doesn't really matter anyway because according to Jacob's nothing really matters after a few years in an old folks home.  His bitter and sarcastic exterior conceals a deep pain and the certain knowledge that the better years of his life have passed by.  As Citizen Kane says old age is the only disease that no one wants to be cured of.Things weren't always this way Jacob was young once until an unfortunate series of circumstances ended his hopes of being a vet forever.  He is then taken on a journey across the country with a circus it is a fun little book and well worse the trip.  The characters have life and everything that fictional characters should have.  You'll find it to be so good that even though you can see the ending coming from three miles away you will not even care.Overall-It is rare that I run across a book this good"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm not sure what to say about this book.  I enjoyed it - it's a cute little historical fiction - but it wasn't fantastic.  just a few random thoughts on the book:* The most interesting character was Walter the dwarf clown and he had a very limited role.* Jacob, the narrator I liked more as a 93yo than as a 23yo, and I never really felt the connection between him and Marlena.* The grime of the circus itself was part of what kept me sucked in - that was brilliantly described.* In the end, I felt a great deal of sympathy for August - he wasn't a good man by any means, but he also was fighting some serious demons.Like I said, I liked the book but I don't feel I need to run out and watch the movie now ...."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As most previous reviewers have said, this is a rich tale of circus life in the '30's. The protaganist, Jacob, is appealing with personality and real human emotion. I feel the author Ms. Gruen has well-researched everything-circus in writing this book.I felt while reading this book I was actually seeing what transpired in my mind's eye-I could see the rough characters come alive and could smell the sawdust, cookin grease, animals and popcorn. I felt what the characters felt when they fell upon hard times. This book also opened my eyes regarding how a rough slice of life a small circus can be.Bring on the circus parade!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is about an old man at the end of his days reflecting upon his life and the events that lead him to run away and join the circus right before he finishes college.  His story goes back and forth between his modern day stay at a nursing home and his days in his early 20s during the Great Depression traveling around the country with the Great Benzini Brothers Circus.Sara Gruen does a phenomenal job of painting a vivid portrait of Depression era America and of the end of the golden age of circus life in the USA.  The Photos that head each chapter are fun little bonuses that let you see the actual performers of this time as well as some of the settings in which the book takes place.The characters come to life and are vivid portrayals of heroes and villians.  The relationships formed amongst all the characters are memorable and keep you wanting more.  A page turner that does a good job of keeping you interested by flipping back and forth between past and present.5 star recommendation."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is an engaging, fast paced story of a veterinarian in a circus during Prohibition.  The plot tension is well-handled and intense.  There is plenty of likeable characters, as well as villains.  And, of course, animals.  It is well-researched, and the setting (circus train stopping in many towns) is realistic, as are the many details of circus life.  I'd thought of circus culture as highly cohesive, but this novel showed serious social stratification.  The characterization is about that of the best genre fiction, though the book isn't genre.  The ending is a bit of a stretch, but a positive one.  The book was hard to put down.  An excellent read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I usually don't read mass market, best selling paperbacks written by women. Nothing wrong with women writers I just don't read them. A friend at work asked if I wanted to read this book and her previous recs were mostly good.I really enjoyed this story. It was a nice change of pace.If you are a guy read this book cause you then have opportunity to see: What girls want in a man and why girls act like they do. That seems like a blanket statement but being a guy I would not have done many things the hero did and I couldn't understand why he thought what he did and was so against sound advice til I realized the author was a women and she was trying to write from a guys perspective. Of course what I have written may not be true and there are surely arguments against but I think I am right.I think you should read this book and am looking forward to the movie"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was apprehensive about reading this book since I watched the movie first. I didn't want to compare and then end up with mixed feelings. I'm so happy that I did watch the movie first because I feel I had a better view of the books layout. The story kept me on the edge of my seat even though I had expectations for the events outcomes. I love that the story of Jacob was related to the bible and I commend the author for that. Amazing book. I love the feeling after reading an outstanding  book and this is surely one of them. Excellent job."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As a person in his 70s who deals with a mother-in-law in her 90s, I found much Jacob's trials in the nursing home close to home. That he could escape into the memory of his youthful connection with the circus was probably a life saver for him.Ms Gruen did a masterful job of separating and at the same time blending Jacob's experiences in his youth with those in his present state of being 90 or 93.It is worth reading this book all the way through to get to a surprising and wonderful end that I shall not reveal so as not to spoil it for others.Ms Gruen obviously researched circuses. Her attention to detail, both when she wrote about the circus and also when she wrote about the nursing home helped make the story realistic.All in all, it was well written and held my attention."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For months, everytime I was in a bookstore - I found that I would gravitate toward this book, read the back and place it back on the shelf.  I should have listened to my instinct.  After many positive recommendations from friends and reading the reviews, I relunctantly check the book out at the local library.  I started reading with an open mind.  After about 200 pages, I phone my friend to ask her if I was missing something, because I just didn't care of the story and I couldn't seem to find a connection with any of the characters.  At this point, she instructed me to stop reading - \"because of you don't like it now, there isn't anything earth shattering that will happen that will make you change your mind.\"  I didn't listen, and she was right."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love this novel. I started reading a printed version, but I had a hard time distinguishing character voices as it was not always marked. And then there were alternating \"young\" and then \"old\" point of view chapters. Before giving up (because I have the same type of challenge when I read Amy Tan novels), I switched to the audio \"book on tape\" and LOVED the book. One of the best novels I've read. And the voice-over talent who read the audio version is a very, very good storyteller."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I can't say it was bad but it sure wasn't good. I have had the book for many years and just got around to reading it. Major disappointment considering the hype and accolades. It had the potential to be much better, but it was trite and lagged all the way through, for the most part. I'm mystified by the massive attention. It, in my opinion, is mediocre, at best. 3 stars is the max I can give it. Great literature it's not. Sophomoric comes to mind."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Excellent read! Ms. Gruen masters character and plot with beautiful prose. I remained captivated and found myself caring for the diverse cast.  Ms. Gruen successfully evokes a sense of the times, the desperate nature of survival during the Depression, as well as one's attempt to salvage one's sense of self as age betrays the body.  The storyline is suspenseful, true to period, and woven through with a touch of romance.  The setting is gritty and evokes the reality of Circus life on the road and  the behind-the-scenes work required to attain the magical world the public craves.  Well done!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I got this on the Kindle when it went on sale. I'm so glad I did. What a wonderfully researched book. The details are amazing and the story is both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. I had never heard of this book until the movie came out, which looks a bit \"chick-flick'ish\" to me but the book definitely is not. I have not seen the movie yet (waiting for the DVD) but I am anxious to see if its true to the book.I think people of all genres will like this book. I normally read paranomal fiction but I really loved this book. My mom usually reads non-fiction girly books and she loved it. I even have my husband reading it now. So by all means, get this book!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants was a fantastic book.  Easy to read and interesting.  Most impressively, a topic that I never gave much thought to, Depression-Era travelling train circuses, was something I enjoyed reading about.  To be honest, I never knew there was such a topic.  Now I'm wondering if there are any Industrial Revolution cat juggling books out there that I should be reading.  Anyway, Gruen seemed to do a decent amount or research for the book, so I learned a little something about the topic.  The best part of the book was the fantastic ending.  More books should end like that."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read Water For Elephants for the second time on Kindle and it was just as exciting as the first time I read it. The book is like being right there at a Barnum and Bailey circus with popcorn and peanuts.  The character, Marlena, was so real, accepting her role as the abused woman and then finally escaping the tyrant she had married.  All of the characters seemed to come to life there on the page.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the scenes. And in the end, when the animals were stampeding, it was interesting to learn that the circus band struck up a particular march to alert the circus performers to take cover or escape.  An excellent read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen spins a fascinating tale of murder, love, obsession, and life in Water for Elephants.  The characters were interesting and well developed.  Her portrayal of the elderly was spot-on without being stereotypical.  That's a very difficult thing to do; not many authors are capable of unraveling the story of an elderly character.Her portrayal of circus life is intriguing, and the characters never failed to invoke strong feelings of endearment, horror, amusement, or pity.  I wouldn't call this a \"must read,\" but it is definitely an interesting story that was well written and well researched."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It's also the only circus novel I've ever read. This is an entertaining drama novel with a love triangle. The characters are nicely fleshed out, and there is a nice to and fro between Jacob's current life as a ninety year old and his adventures in the circus. Gruen does a charming job of describing Jacob as an old man and the ending is very good. Whilst the book is good I think it has been lucky that it has benefitted from great marketing and a big budget film as there are other books which are more powerful & more deserving than this book that have not received any recognition.Enjoyably recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When this book is telling the story of the circus, it is fascinating, describing a world that most readers know nothing about. But, possibly in an attempt to make it more \"commercial\", the author has chosen to focus on the love story, which is predictable. In those scenes, fascination turns to boredom.Use all that research (described in detail at the end of the book), Ms Gruen, to tell us more stories of the roustabouts, performers, animals and freaks of the circus - and forget the \"plot\" and the soap!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a wonderful book made better by excellent readers.Jacob Jankowski joins the circus as a young man after the death of his parents.  This was during the depression when many were willing to work for little more than regular meals.  Sara Gruen tells the story of a traveling circus with a surety that makes it hard to believe she has never experienced the cruelty, hard times and camaraderie of circus life.  Even more amazing, the story is told from the perspective of Jacob as a 93 year old man forgotten in a nursing home.There are two readers, one for the young Jacob and one for the old, and both are a true pleasure to listen to."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved reading this as I had been taken to a circus a lot as a little girl in NE Illinois and as an adult I worked in 8 different nursing homes. It was wonderful seeing it from the patient's eyes and reading his story. I remember many a story told by patients. One was an old silent movie star! I wonder if Sara Gruen had any nursing home experiance as she nailed it including the caring and non caring type of people that work there and why some of the patients may be grumpy. The view of the circus behind the scenes was a fantastic story!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a beautifully constructed book. The circus atmosphere is rich and detailed, and it's redolent of its time period. The images are strong and the pace, while not fast, is stately -- perhaps the way an elephant moves??I deducted a star for two reasons. First, it seemed that some leaps in the story came too quickly. Jacob should have spent a bit more time with Rosie before he made the statement \"I was close to falling in love with her;\" that happened a bit too fast to be believable. Also, the ENDING was awful: contrived and saccharine. That was a huge disappointment, after the rest of the book.Overall, though, a literary and very good read, two things that don't always go together."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I finally got around to reading Water for Elephants, it's been on my Kindle forever. I was interested in seeing the movie, but didn't want to until I read the book.It was good, especially the end. At times I wanted to finish just to move on to my next book, but at the end of I was hooked on seeing what would happen next. For some reason, I didn't get what all the craze was about though. Probably because I read a lot of really excellent books this year, including another circus book that blew this one away."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When I read a book, I want to immerse myself in it.  I don't want jarring inconsistencies to remind me that it's fiction, and not particularly well written fiction at that.  The speech of Jacob, who supposedly is in the setting of 70 years ago, is disturbingly nonauthentic.  People at that time didn't use the same phrases we use now and putting them in, when you're picturing them in the dress and background of that time period is annoying and unnecessary.  This author needed a better editor.  It's not a 'best' book and the fact that the author is begging for votes makes you wonder about her integrity."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had high expectations for this, but it was kind of a chore to finish.  It was too depressing!  Too much brutality to the circus animals AND the circus humans, drunkenness, filth, squalor -- plus the portrait of life in the nursing home was grim.  When the narrator finally gets his true love, the author rushes through it in a few sentences and then goes back to the grimness.  I give her two stars because she's obviously done a lot of research on circuses, and I thought the photos were charming."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was very pleased with this book. Not the harlequin romance I was expecting, but turned out to be even more. You can't help but fall in love with the relationships Jacob has with Camel, Walter, Rosie and Marlena. The author shows his humanity towards all the menagerie and roustabouts. I read the book before I watched the movie. Which I'm very glad I did. The book takes you on a deeper journey with Jacob at 93 and 23. The movie totally skips over Jacob at the nursing home. They didn't build Jacob at 93 for anyone who'd never read the book to understand him. Had I'd just watched the movie without ever reading the book. I would walk away happy, but in ignorance. I would definitely recommended this book to anyone and would advice to read the book before watching the movie."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was recommended to me by a few different people.  I knew NOTHING about it when I went to pick it up.  I was hesitant at first.  I am not a fan of the circus at all.  But knowing that one of the friends that had recommended it is also not a fan of the circus, I was cautiously optimistic.I am glad that I gave it a chance.  It is a well written story that really draws a vivid picture for you.  A great reflection of the times with a love story that had me in tears in parts.  Highly recommend to all."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Possibly the best book I've read in nearly 20 years. An easy, yet difficult at the same time read, I found myself unable to put it down although there were parts so heart-wrenching, my eyes filled with tears throughout this realistically-written novel. Also, the movie based on this book is one of the very few which Hollywood did not completely destroy (but PLEASE read the book first!).And guys, this isn't just some flaky chick-lit...my boyfriend read it with me (HIS idea!), finished it first, then hounded me to hurry up and finish reading it so he could discuss it with me. And he doesn't usually take an interest in anything that's not Lord of the Rings-esque.So, go forth, read and enjoy-I own both the book and the Kindle version-either way, it's a winner."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Loved it! This was a really complete story. The characters were fascinating, the setting exotic and the story enthralling from the beginning. The writing didn't get in the way of the story (which I love). I loved the animal characters and their relations with the humans. It had a \"Life of Pi\" vibe, but was more grounded in reality. I got very attached to the main character as an old man (it jumps back and forth - but not in an annoying way - really lends itself to telling the epic of his life while only delving into a few years of it). The author shows restraint describing any suffering of animals and lowly circus workers - which I appreciate - can't stand when they knock you over the head with it. Very well researched, no boring details - just the good stuff :)"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Following a family tragedy, Jacob Jankowski abandons life as a college student, and instead of working as a veterinarian alongside his father, finds himself caring for animals in a traveling circus--the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob befriends numerous characters, from the glamorous performer Marlena, to the alcoholic Camel, who works setting up the circus, to the Benzini Brothers' star elephant, Rosie. As he travels between different castes of the circus and across America, Jacob narrates the triumphs and hardships experienced by the people and animals of the Great Depression-era attraction.Interspersed throughout the novel are chapters that introduce the reader to the present-day, nonagenarian Jacob, as he laments his current living arrangement in a nursing home.Despite several graphic descriptions of animal abuse and the cruelty displayed the novel's antagonists, the story is ultimately fun, escapist and sentimental, with an optimistic, if improbable, conclusion."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants captivates the reader with its deeply moving and touching storyline.It is charming,magical.... laced with sadness,humour,joy. The story of a young man who loses everything dear to him in this world and then finds meaning and happiness in the most unexpected and least likely place....a traveling circus. The book really brings to life the spirit and times of a traveling circus(set in the backdrop of the Great Depression). Its many colorful,unique characters vividly bring to life this largly forgotten bygone era.Water for Elephants is simply a pleasure to read.  The only drawback to the book is that there is quite a bit of cursing and several sexually explicit passages that might offend certain readers.If you can overlook or skip these rough spots you will certainly experience great pleasure in reading Water for Elephants."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have never read anything like this and I loved every page.  Very few books have actually made me gasp in shock.  There is so much about the traveling circus that is appalling yet intriguing at the same time.  And who knows what is fact and fiction?  Gruen blends the two beautifully.  I am now really interested to learn more about this era of the circus.  I read my copy in 3 days and have already loaned it out.  Trust me, this is a good book!  And so different from any story line I've ever read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The parts of this book that dealt with the main character in old age, were very insightful and I enjoyed that.  But quite honestly had I known that it would detail the abuse of the circus animals and then also the detailed sex acts I would never had purchased this.  I wish I knew how to delete it from my Kindle.  I also wish someone else had mention this in the reviews that I saw.  I NEVER stop reading a book, but had to quit about 35% of the way thru it, it was disgusting and I am not a prude.I would never recommend this book, nor will I venture to the movie."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Spolier Alert (kinda): I really enjoyed the reflection of the characters past and present. I found the love story to be a bit wishy washy.  when visting the main characters past I didn't really buy into the &#34;love at first sight&#34; idea. Not sure why, but I was asking why? Why did Marlena fall in love with Jacob? What made him stand out so much? It sounds bad that i say that, but I just didn't feel a spark between the characters. The whole damsel in distress was manufactured. Additionally, it was super convenient the way they ended up together in the end. Overall, I did enjoy the story and I was more drawn to the present version Jacob."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was first drawn to this novel based on a short synopsis I had read on Amazon, and after many views decided to buy the novel.  I have never been so pleased with a book purchase as I am with this one.  Just reading the jacket alone draws you in to Gruen's amazing literary ability.  I finished the book about a  month ago, and am now on to Kite Runner, yet I can't help to be disappointed as I keep comparing it to Water for Elephants and am coming up short.  Congrats to Sara Gruen, I am absolutely blown away by how well this woman can not only write, but how easily one can picture the entire novel and feel as though they are right there at the circus.  The last few chapters I found myself both grimacing and smiling - completely drawn into the book and upset that it couldn't last longer.  If there is one book that will stay with you for a long time, I am convinced it is this one."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story alternates between present-day and flashbacks through the mind of our now 93-year-old main character.  The historical aspects of this book are incredibly well-researched and do a great deal to advance the plot of the story.  Unfortunately, the present-day scenes are rather dull.  I found myself skimming over those sections because I was eager to return to reading about Jacob's life working on the circus in the 1930s.The love story in this book - a tale of forbidden love between Jacob and Marlena, the married star of the big top show - is sweet, but ultimately predictable.  With the exception of one sharp twist, I felt that the love story ending of this novel is fairly cookie cutter.  That being said, I can't deny the fact that I was thoroughly entertained by every page."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants was one of those books that was difficult to put down.  The prose flowed very smoothly. The subject of the circus world during the depression was well researched and make accessible to the reader.  It could be read on many levels, but even a surface level was satisfying.My only problem, as with many best sellers, was that the action was in places not very realistic.  This may be a bit picky, but after suffering from a concussion, nobody is ready to climb on top of a moving train and hop between cars, no matter how pumped they are with adrenaline.  Such lapses in credibility hurt an otherwise wonderful novel."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was just pointless. I feel like I was reading a novel generated by a random plot generator which spit out a circus, an old guy and a young guy-- nothing had the tactical feel of reality in this book. It was mediocre at best. Even the title of the novel was anticlimactic, given that one of old Jacob's nursing home fellows said he used to carry water for elephants and then not mentioned again. This novel is devoid of anything making it worth reading: Complex plot? No; Mercurial characters? No; Insights into the human condition? No; Stupendous vocabulary and/or Joycean constructions with the English language? No. Instead, we are left with chapter after chapter of a book better suited as children's literature."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I could write a book about this book but will keep it short and simple.  This book tells a very entertaining story of Jacob (never referred to as \"Jake\" in the book) and a twist of fate that sees his fate aligned with a circus after his parents are killed.  It's a very engaging book, well written and enough to keep you reading into the wee hours of the night.  I can't imagine the movie could possibly keep up but may give it a shot.  I don't see Robert Pattison as Jacob necessarily.Great book!  And for those who seemed to think the book fell flat - you're digging too deep for meaning - relax and enjoy a good read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The strength of the book is its narrative flow. I particularly liked the little catch-words that usually connected the \"assisted living\" chapters with the circus chapters. Gruen generally wrote in such connections, and I found them both ingeniously crafted and useful in uniting the narrative.In addition to telling a great story, Gruen gives a remarkably detailed picture of the circus world of the 1930s. I had definitely never heard of a \"cooch tent\" before reading this book, for example, and Gruen's depiction of its solo practitioner is thoughtful, humane, and free of cliches. The ideas of circuses getting booted out of town, of people getting booted off the circus trains, and of entrepreneurs cannibalizing the remnants of failed circuses were also quite fascinating.To the extent that Gruen wanted to make an analogy to the biblical Jacob story by obscurely dropped hints and anagrammed names, I think, however, that she pushed too far. This novel stands nicely on its own without this type of symbolism or metaphor."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Beautifully written with characters that define humanity with their strengths but more so their weaknesses, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a most touching tale that brings the reader into a completely different and lost world of the travelling circuses during the Great Depression.What makes Sara Gruen's novel all too unique is her ability to bring us into the lives of her ordinary characters leading such extraordinary existence in the circus world.  Amidst the spectacle to provide temporary entertainment lies the cruelty and the debauchery never seen outside the performance area. A grumpy dwarf and his pet, an elephant who exhibits exceptional talent and is more human than the people around her ... a circus star and a would-be vet ... who would have thought that an insight into their lives can so summarize the abandonment of youth ...and the sadness of old age reviewing an existence that has come to pass?One of the most worthwhile reads for quite a time, this novel is a gem."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Our Kindle Book Club gave this book 7 out of 10.  I liked the way Gruen brought a life together and illustrated the ways we gain respect and lose respect.  The history of the Circus life was based on fact, it showed the degree of cruelty toward animals and humans in the desire to make money. There was also a degree of cruelty and lack of respect in the Nursing Home. The love story was nicely developed without becoming the main story.  We loved Jacob he was a good man.  The ending was brilliant, he won!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Have you ever asked yourself these questions? \"What is a life worth? How do you judge if someone is worth saving? What does it mean to be human? What distinguishes an animal from a human being?\" Hidden beneath this easy-to-read though dark coming-of-age romance is a theme that prompts the reader to ask the above questions. The answer come through the reminiscing of protagonist Jacob Jankowski--a man at the end of his fascinating life. The story begins with the circus rolling into town, triggering a flood of Jankowski's memories, full of pleasure, joy, love, hate, regret & guilt. Sara Gruen brings the quaint circus existence of the mid 20th century to life through meticulous research and wonderful storytelling. Anyone who ever dreamed of running away to the big top or just dreamed of running away should read this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a wonderful story of a rag-tag bunch of people and animals, who just happened to be called a circus!  They traveled by train during the depression and had some fascinating adventures along the way.  We meet Jacob Jankowski, a young man who accidently lands  on the train.  He decides to stay and become the circus veterinarian.  He meets lovely Marlena and her evil husband, August.  Of course he falls in love with her, but the husband is a force to be reckoned with.  There is also Walter (Kinko)the clown, Big Al, Camel, and of course Rosie the Elephant.  The ending is extremely satisfying.  This book is well-researched and authentic.  I loved it!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a good book about the circus (a comment I never thought I would ever make).  Jacob's story is heartbreakingly sympathetic.  Ms. Gruen's mastery of the circus vocabulary really sets the stage for the plotline.  A remarkable amount of reseach went into writing circus lore.  This is no Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth.  This is a downtrodden, edging ever closer to disaster circus run by the same type of people.  I must admit I had to skip anything that resembled animal cruelty (although I am sure it is factual).  My inability to deal with this led to my giving the book only 4 stars.  A reflection on the reviewer more than on the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a delightful summer read. Everything about this book was good. You could really identify and feel passionate (good or bad) about the characters, including the animals. All the loose ends are wrapped up. It makes me feel nostalgic and she has a way of transporting you back in time without being too wordy. The book is well written and entertaining. This was pretty  much the best book I read all summer. I even cried a little at the end. :) I really hope they make this book into a movie. It would be such a great movie if it was done correctley. Everyone should read this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Wow! Water for Elephants was recommended by a friend of mine. She loved the book so much, she bought it for me. I am happy she did!! This story was heartfelt, mind blowing, awesomely good!!!!!! Sara definitely has a masterpiece on her hands. Jacob and Marlena' s life, Rosie, all the crew, and other animals. What they went through and how they end up. I loved and cried. Camel and Walter, so sad. Water for Elephants is A must read!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book.  It was sometimes hard to read, when Rosie the elephant was being beaten, for example, but overall, it was so incredibly good.  One point that bothered me, though.  WHY did the author NOT have Jacob turn back and look for Walter???  Just because the other men said he \"probably did not survive the night\" does not mean he didn't.  At very least Jacob SHOULD have gone back and found out for sure, especially since Walter had done a lot of good for him.  That was the only part of the book I felt let down by, although I still loved the book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I dont need to go into too much detail, as most of the reviews here have covered the plot.  I downloaded this on my kindle app during a horrendous layover at the airport, and it was nice read that kept my interest.  For some reason this book reminds me of Mitch Albom, in the style it was written and the flashbacks.  Looking forward to the movie, as I had envisioned the main character Marlena to look very similar to Reese Witherspoon during my read.  Pictures kept the chapters interesting as well."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'd probably never have picked up this book on my own, but it was chosen by a book club I've been coerced into joining.  It was an enjoyable book and very quick to read.  It's the story of a young man who accidently joins a mangy circus during the depression following a personal tragedy, and grows up in the process.  The background of the circus, particularly at this time in recent history, was vivid and fascinating, and it would be worth reading the book for that alone."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was nothing short of amazing. From the first page to the last, I did not want to put it down and when it ended, I was sad it was over. One of the things that makes the book so strong is the characters. from Jacob to August to \"Rosie\", there isn't a character that I did not feel moved by at one point or another.There is a dark side to the circus life and this book will show you things you never imagined that happen outside the Big Top. So, if you are going to buy one book this year, make it this one."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Although this is a work of fiction, author Sara Gruen did extensive research into the circus world during the Depression years.  She weaves some real-life incidents into the story of Jacob Jankowski, a beloved only son who is well on his way to becoming a veterinarian.  Shortly before he is due to graduate, his parents are killed in a car accident and he is left penniless.  He accidentally climbs on a circus train and his fate is then sealed.  Despite the fact that he has not finished his veterinary training, he is taken on as a circus vet.  The story is told by Jacob when he is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and is waiting for his family to come and take him to the cicus.  The book is interesting and creative, and is a very good read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was practically forced to read this book by my partner, who loved it and would not stop insisting that I had to read it. I offered lots of excuses as I put it off, but the truth is, I couldn't care less about the circus. When I finally gave in and started reading Water for Elephants, I realized on the first page that my apathy for the circus didn't matter.This was a touching, clever, totally unexpected story. It offers a window into how we treat the elderly, animals, and people of a different class, without ever being preachy. There were times when I feared it would become a depressing wallow, but that never happened. The unexpected upswing at the end was particularly satisfying. A great read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was a quick read, and I thought it was very interesting. The reader gets a close up view of the inner workings of the circus, the performers, animal caretakers, etc, mixed in with a love story of sorts. However, even though the book was good, it was not great. It's not one I'd want to keep, or read again. The author introduced too many characters too quickly, and only after reading on for awhile do you sort them out. I didn't really come to love any of the characters enough to care much about what happened to them. The plot seemed weak, character development weak. I liked the HBO series Carnivale, and although this is also a circus book, it was slightly disappointing to me."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book hit every note for me.  Gruen had me the moment she introduced Jacob as a veterinarian and Marlena as a horsewoman.  Perfection!The adventures, the setting, the desperation of the animals, the workers and of the lovers all came together to make such a beautiful, memorable read for me. Sweet revenge and a perfect ending make this one of my top ten reads (and re-reads) time after time.  I've since recommended it to many people and it remains a favorite to this day."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book last year and am sincerely hoping that the movie is able to sufficiently capture the adventure, romance, and poignancy.  I not only enjoyed the flashbacks to the days in the circus - I REALLY enjoyed the perspective of the character in a current day nursing home.  This book has it all and is written in a way that it easily became a movie in my mind as I read.  Many times books like this have sad endings but the ending to this story is excellent!  I highly recommend this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a fantastic story.  Jacob Jankowski is a 93 year old man.  When the circus pays a visit to the lot across from the Nursing Home he lives in, it takes him back to when he was employed by a circus during the depression.  And so the book alternates between today and the 1930's.  This book grabbed me from the beginning.  Especially since Jacob attended school at Cornell and caught the circus train on it's way to Utica.  Places I am very familiar with.  The fact that he is Polish is another plus.  This story is put together very well.  Gruen obviously did her research and I finish this book with some knowledge about Jamaica ginger paralysis, exotic animal behavior and of course, the circus.  It is definitely going on my personal list of \"classics\" and \"1001 books to read before you die\"."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've decided I just can't finish this book. The main character is a 23-year old male, but c'mon - I just don't appreciate some of the details the author is having him describe and they are totally unnecessary to the story. I've read almost nine chapters and decided I don't need any more images like the explicit strip scene, the details of a graphic \"8-pager\", and I certainly didn't need the picture of what the dwarf is doing alone on his cot while looking at the graphic magazine. It's a big disappointment because the story is actually interesting and I want to find out what happens but not badly enough to wade through the sludge. I don't think I've been this disappointed in a story since the ending of Angela's Ashes."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book from cover to cover, and I'm glad I did.  But I thought it was very sad, because of the old man in the nursing home narrating the book, because of the animal abuse to the elephant and other species, and because of the spousal abuse to the elephant rider.  Oh, there were elements of humor, friendship, love, and happiness.  The ending was good as well as unexpected.  Still, if I had to describe this book in just one word, it would be \"sad.\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I know there are hundreds of reviews for this book, but I liked it so much, I just had to add mine. I usually read a book before seeing the movie. I fing that the book is generally better than the movie. This book was amazing. I felt like I was living in a real circus. I am also a nurse, so can identify with the main character in a nursing home. Nursing home people are so very lonely. anyway, this is a real story, like the ones you were told when you were young. It took me back and made me feel like I was truely there. You have to read it. Maybe I'll see the movie now.barbara"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Despite haunting cover art and a great title, despite obvious research and well thought out prose, and despite the fact that this book is the darling of the Independent Booksellers Association, I felt let down.  Part of the problem was that I expected a lot and had held this book on my shelf, until I could really savor it.  It does start out strong, and Gruen keeps her time periods well separated.  But the characters, especially the narrator, feel stock and unfinished and merely devices on which to hang the proceeds of research.  Because of the plusses of the book enumerated in the opening sentence of my review, I give 3 stars, but for the back story, it would be fewer."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of this book. \"A book about a circus? How good could that really be?\" I thought. It took awhile for me to get into it too. It wasn't that the beginning was boring or anything, it just took me a little while to get into the plot of the story. After I did though, I couldn't put it down. I lost sleep over the need to finish this book. Some parts I found surprisingly funny. It was an overall, all around good book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water For Elephants was just what I wanted in a book right now: an easy read, fun, romantic, with a unique setting. Sara Gruen's research into the life of long forgotten train circuses and America in the 1930s was obviously extensive and the way she used her knowledge in the writing of the book was loving and playful and made me want to learn more about it. There were a few things that I looked up, curious to know if they were the author's invention or actual historical facts that she incorporated into her story. For example, I had never heard of \"Jake Leg\" before and commend her for revealing in the context of her book parts of American history that most people must be unfamiliar with. The characters were well drawn and the fictional Circus she created was completely believable. I loved the photographs that accompanied each chapter which added to the believablity of her story. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to immerse themselves in a good old fashioned yarn filled with romance and even a little danger."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book.  I could not put it down, because I was in such suspense about what would happen next.  I particularly love the storyline of the character as an old man in a nursing home - having worked in nursing homes, the descriptions are spot on.  I laughed out loud at his antics, and cried when characters I had grown to love were lost to tragedy.  I have never read a book where an elephant is a main character and pivotal to the story.  All I can say is \"WOW.\""}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I saw this book in the bookstore and it sounded very interesting so I got it out of the library. I wasn't disappointed. It was very easy to read and flowed nicely. Very interesting and quirky characters which I liked. Rosie the elephant was a great character. I agree with one of the other reviewers who compared the book to Sophies Choice. I thought the same thing when we meet the ringmaster. I really enjoyed the book but I was disappointed that there were a couple of parts that were unnecessarily crude (as opposed to necessarily crude?). It's like the female writer of the book had to prove that she could be as crude as any man. Other than that, it was one of my favourite books this year."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm not one to read historical pieces, mostly because I don't think I'll relate to the people and times, but this book is an exception. An exceptional exception! I loved \"Water for Elephants.\" Tragedy, mystery, adventure, humor and romance -- this book has it all. This is the story of a young man who finds himself working as a veterinarian for a traveling circus during the Great Depression era, but it's really so much more. So, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and enjoy this masterpiece!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Never having been particularly interested in all things circus-y, I put this book back on the bookstore shelf more than once. But an Amazon review of another, quite unrelated novel referenced this book so I picked up a copy. Really glad I did. This is a well-paced novel that doesn't fall into the trap of doubling as a documentary on the early twentieth century circus trade. It is engaging, romantic, with sufficient drama and excitement to keep the pages turning over well into the night. Maybe at times a little cute, but a solid four-star effort."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My daughter has been asking me to read this book for years.  I resisted because I read the synopsis and thought \"a story about a circus in the era of the great depression? Nah.\"  I finally downloaded it and gave it a go and couldn't put the book down.  Seriously this is one of the best books I've read in years!  I felt like I was right there.  The narrative shifts back and forth between old Jacob and young Jacob seamlessly.  I strongly regret waiting so long to read this book.  And for you Nook/Kindle lovers, this book is only $5 to download.  I would have paid full price.  It is a haunting story and often had me thinking of my own aging.  What will it feel like to be inside a body that is old and doesn't function like it used to, yet the mind still feels young?  I can't wait for the movie to come out in April."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book because it was rated so highly and it was a NaNoWriMo novel. Somehow I made it to the bit that describes the old man having a shower which is about a 1/3 the way through according to my Kindle progress bar. I don't know how. I found it so incredibly vulgar that I just couldn't keep going. I didn't even care enough about the characters or the story to skip to the last few pages to find out what happened. In fact, I wish I could erase what I did read from my head and gain back the time I wasted reading it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Oh how I loved this book! The story is told by its main character, Jacob who is now confined to a nursing home, reminiscing about his time spent in the circus. It tells of Jacob's life travelling in a circus during the Depression and of the harsh conditions for the workers in during this time. There are so many great characters in this novel that have great depth to them, including Rosie the Elephant. This is much more than a novel about the circus, it has a great story that everyone should do themselves a favour and read! I'm looking forward to seeing whether the movie can capture just what a truly captivating story this novel tells. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have never been a fan of the circus, but I do enjoy historical fiction, so I gave this one a try. I was skeptical at best when starting. The story is mildly interesting, entertaining,and entirely predictable. The characters were shallow, not well developed, but the story moves along quickly enough so this is not a big distraction. An earlier reveiwer summarized the book as \"melodramatic\" and I completely agree. It is like popcorn; light, fluffly, easy to digest and quickly forgotten. Not a bad way to spend a rainy weekend -- if there is nothiing on TV."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just finished this book, and oh my word, what a fun, very quick read :-)  The story was wonderful and I loved the back and forth from the \"old\" Jacob to the \"young\" Jacob, the the past reality, to the current reality.The detail of the writing was so descriptive that I felt like I was in the hobo \"city\" or seeing the high trestle that Walter & Camel were thrown off of. It was just an amazing story, I'd suggest it to anyone, at any age."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've been seeing this book for years at book stores and amazon website but for some reason I wasn't interested. The idea of a novel that takes place in a circus didn't seem exciting to me. Then, the kindle version of the book is offered with a great price and I reluctantly buy it and even more reluctantly read it. What a surprise... I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. The main character, Jacob, is brilliant especially at old age. I learned a lot about circus life and people. I thought the ending was marvelous. Now, I have to watch the movie and see how it compares to the novel. Very enjoyable read and highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I recently finished reading Water for Elephants.  The historical elements in this novel were carefully researched which made for a thrilling book.  I loved the way the story was told by an elderly man living in a nursing home and it bounced back and forth between timelines.  You fell in love with the grumpy man and you think about what the elderly actually feel like when they are forced to live in places like this. His story is touching and you really get to know all of the characters.  The elephant is a sweetheart and it's amazing how smart she is.  Great book and look forward to seeing the movie to see how well it was done."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A very well-written piece of literary fiction that is not easily forgotten.  I picked up the novel because of its great reviews and my disdain for the circus and inhumane treatment of circus animals, but ended up loving it because of a very engaging plot and my great affection for the main character in particular.  This novel is SO much more than a great story of Depression-era circus workers and performers; that simply lays the very interesting foundation. The ending was the best I've read in a long time and brought the novel full circle.  I look forward to more books by Sara Gruen!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had no desire whatsoever to read this book until I saw a trailer for the movie. The tailer caught my eye and since books are always better then the movie I took a chance and found that I thought it was a great story. The story felt real. It's a very believeable read and I liked that it wasn't sugar coated. It held my interest and taught me a lot about circus life in that time period. The ending completely caught me off guard. Water for Elephants is a story that will stay with me forever. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "After all the hype about this book, I finally gave in to reading a borrowed copy. I wanted to like it, truly I did.  I made it to page 164 with some effort.  The characters were not developed well enough for me to like them.  Also, I work with elderly people and the narrator as an elderly man was not altogether believable.What I did enjoy was learning a bit about the circus business  back in the 30s.Please if you know of some real 5-star novels, non-romance, let me know."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The various characters made this story interesting.  Each brought a part of every day life.  Some were misjudged.  I did not like the fact that one could not trust anyone well unless he/she were very well acquainted with each person.  the story was fascinating and circus life was presented as hard work, low pay, and no home for many.  I would recommend this book to imaginative spirits, and to those who trust and judge too easily and quickly.  There were some tender parts that were a relief from all the cheating."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If I live to be a thousand years old, I will never understand the hoopla surrounding this novel.  It was praised for its meticulous research, but while reading it I found myself thinking that it had been written by somebody who had never been to a circus, and I was unsurprised to find out that I was correct.  My first college roommate was a real circus girl, and I can tell you that Sara Gruen did not even scratch the surface of circus life.It's a rare writer who can write well in the voice of the gender they are not, and Sara Gruen is not eligible for that club.  If I had not known for sure that a woman had written it, it wouldn't have been a difficult guess.The story is so melodramatic, it belongs among the most florid of historical romantic fiction, and that is not my cup of tea.  I had to force myself to complete this book.  I wish I hadn't."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for elephants was certainly an entertaining read, but I have  read better. It did help to open my eyes to the life of circus performers in the 1920's. This was very well projected throughout the entire book, and it was easy to tell that the author was very well educated on the topic. I do think however that there should be a warning about the sexual content within the book. I would only recommend it for mature readers. I would recommend this book if you have a lot of time to enjoy the context in which it was written."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book from beginning to end. Along with some entertaining history, this is a beautifully woven tale.  To my mind, a good novel has unexpected twists and surprises .. and this book carried one beautiful surprise all the way through.This book stirred in me an affection for elephants that I hadn't felt since childhood.  Along with The Magician's Elephant by Kate DiCamillo, Water for Elephants helped to inspire the painting \"The Gentle Somnambulist\" which is included in my bookTREASURE Twenty One Paintings and a Key."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water For Elephants was an excellent book detailing what life was like for those who worked for the circus during the Depression era and later.  This wonderful story was told in flashback by a crotchety ninety-year old, man named, Jacob who lives in a nursing home.Other reviewers have already summarized the story very well. Therefore, I just want to add that I especially enjoyed Water For Elephants specifically because it was told from the perspective of an elderly individual who, in telling the circus-days story of his youth, also gave the reader a realistic perspective of aging.  For me, this was what made Sara Gruen's novel all the more compelling.For those who have elderly family in nursing homes, I would recommend that you read this book to your love one. I'm sure they will enjoy it as much as you!Maizie Lucille JamesJanuary 13, 2012"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I am not sure what I see all the hype about for this book but it was a pageturner, I'll give it that. The writing was very well done as Jacob told his tale of being in the circus all these years later in a nursing home, forgotten and old in body, not in mind.The life of the circus was clearly visible while reading this story as was the life in a nursing home. At first I was more interested to have the chapters go back to the present because the past was so horrible to witness but then his present life wasn't that cozy either.The ending was the best part of the book, for me, as it was most tender. It wasn't a bad read but not an entertaining one."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "At the time of this review there are over 1,700 reviews posted so I won't bother to sum up the story but just my opinion of the book.I thought the book was simple to read, an interesting story and engaging characters.Even though this novel is not perfect and a standard \"boy meets girl\" story with a charming setting, the descriptions are colorful and the characters are a variety of misfits; but somehow it all works and comes together very nicely for an entertaining and well paced read.Granted, the book is not going to be put on a shrine of the scholarly literary Olympus, but to me this book felt as if I was reading a fairytale - and I tremendously enjoyed it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As a person who usually reads non-fiction books about science and psychology, I thought I'd give myself a break and see what all the hype surrounding Water for Elephants was about. I was not disappointed. It was not the best book I've ever read, but it was very entertaining and a pretty quick read. I was explaining to someone that the story is very formulaic: guy wants girl, can't have girl, ends up getting girl - but it was set against a different backdrop than others. Sometimes that's exactly the kind of book you want to read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'd never read anything by Sarah Gruen before and I'd heard a lot of hype about this book due to the release of the movie. I decided to hold off watching the film until I'd had a chance to see for myself how the book was.I'm so glad I waited.This book had me from it's opening pages all the way to the close. The descriptions of life in a traveling circus were gritty and made me feel as if I were really on that train, traveling with Jacob, Walter, and Camel. Ms. Gruen's character developments were also incredible, and as a writer myself, I found myself wishing I had one iota of her talent for bringing them to life so vividly.The story is well paced, with just hints from the elder Jacob as to how his life turned out. I liked the transition from old voice to young and felt as if I could \"see\" the character both ways.All in all, a fantastic read!Nephilim"}

It was one of those books which makes it difficult to begin another book.  I cared about the characters, and the events lingered after I completed it.  That is saying a lot about a book for me; I'm a voracious reader and I usually begin a new book as soon as I finish the last.  I think it is a book which would appeal to a wide range of readers'"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I put this item on my wishlist when it first came out because the premise sounded interesting and then I forgot about it until I saw it was released in paperback. I purchased it and was not let down. The story starts a little slow was you try to make sense of what is going on and whose exactly is this main character, but it takes off from there and I basically read the book in a day and some hours.  I highly recommend, as it really is a great story of time past and present."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I wanted to rate this a \"zero.\" WHY can't there be a minus stars rating. Totally disappointed. Over-the top melodramatic and predictable, especially since the ending is revealed in the first 5 pages. AWFUL, totally dreadful, prose. WHY, would ANY publisher (other than Harleguin Press) pick this tripe up! Thank god I got this from the library and didn't pay $$$ for this.I suspect this may be one of those rare instances where the film version might be better (but only if they make the orig novel unrecognizable). It certainly couldn't be any worse. I listened to the audio version while exercising and could not reach the fast-forward button--made my workouts twice as difficult. ;-)"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a wonderful story! It is all at once funny, heart-breaking, and thought-provoking. I found myself so absorbed in the story that when I had to stop reading in the course of a day I was disoriented for a few minutes before I could deal with my real life. That, to me, is a sign of a great book. I loved how seamlessly the narrative moved between Jacob as an old man of ninety, or ninety-three, and the young Jacob especially. There were no odd stops and starts and no chunks of time missing between past and present. And the end had me flipping back to the beginning to see if I read it right the first time (but in a good way)! Absolutely wonderful!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was an engaging story from start to finish. The author did a wonderful job telling Jacob Jankowski's story as an old man biding his time in an assisted living facility waiting to go to the circus, and as a young adult, who after finding himself homeless and parentless, jumps a circus train.I found the ending a bit surprising, but beautiful all the same. This was an easy read and something I couldn't put down. I love it when an author is truly able to bring you back to a time and place and make it so believable as Sara Gruen has done with Water for Elephants.Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen spins a yarn, more than just a circus story, filled with memorable characters (not all human, some at a crucial crossroads), and highly dramatic events juxtaposed with the loneliness of old age. Near the end of his life, Jacob Jankowski finds himself reminiscing about his salad days, as painful as they might have been. He knows life is about the pleasure and the pain; you can't have one without the other (like good and evil). After a tragic loss, Jacob finds a home with a traveling circus as a veterinarian and along the way he: loses his virginity, makes some true friends, learns some valuable life lessons, and falls in love. But above all this book is about his grand love affair, how it began and how it will end. Oh, and there's an elephant named Rosie mixed in there too. I recommend this strongly. 4.5 stars."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I've just finished the book and liked it a great deal. Some of the research which underpins the book was outstanding. Depression era circuses, train circuses as Ms Gruen calls them, being a hobo on the rails, the brain of an elephant and the thread about Jamaican Ginger - all were fascinating - as was the almost seamless blending of the two time periods. Clearly the lady can absorb large quantities of research information and transform that into an excellent novel. She clearly, and obviously, loves animals. Will I buy the two other books listed here on Amazon? I don't think so but I am sure that horse lovers will and should."}

What an enjoyable read! While the ending was a bit cliche, it was still a very interesting and entertaining book. The author weaving the past with the present really moved the story along and helped gain sympathy for our lead character. I would definitely recommend this book - especially to all those that don't usually appreciate the 'book of the month club' type of books. And even though I'm probably one of the only people I know that is NOT into Rob Pattinson, (LOL!) I would definitely like to see this movie. I read this on my Kindle and wish I had bought it in paperback so I could have shared it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is a book narrated by the memories of an old man in a nursing home flashing back to his life as a young vet on a travelling circus. Its based in the 1930s when the circus travelled by train into towns, to show off sideshow freaks and animal shows.What can I say about this book, it just didn&#8217;t grab me really and was a bit of a disappointment. The way it was written was very plain English and didn&#8217;t hold my attention or amuse me with the words. The talk about the animals and circus life was interesting and well researched. But the love story just wasn&#8217;t believable &#8211; the beautiful starlet falling for the pimply red headed virgin boy &#8211; nope don&#8217;t buy it sorry!I would recommend this book for animal lovers, young teens and the older generations as it has a mix from both sides of the story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is a small step up from chick-lit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it's what you're looking for.  A great read for the beach, or a good light read in-bewteen heavier or darker novels.As mentioned in other reviews, the character development was on the poor side, and the plot was pretty predictable (kind of hokey).  I felt the reading level was quite low, which made it a quick read, but not the brightest one.  Everything was pretty spoon-fed to the reader...there was no need for me to think about anything.  I prefer a bit more of a challenge."}

Granted, it's not Dickens, but it is great fun.Jacob's experience as the an old man reminded me so much of the nursing home my mother died in. His experience as a young man reminded me of the stories my father told about the depression, especially riding the \"freights.\"I passed this book along to a woman co-worker, and after she finished it, she said, \"I love this book!\"Sara Gruen did a marvelous job researching train circuses.

The story begins as the circus rolls into town and the flood of Jankowski's past full of pleasure, joy, love, hate, regret & guilt washes over him.Sara Gruen brings the Circus Culture of the mid 20th century to life through meticulous research, both the bright spot light and the grittier nature of transitory existence.

By the end I was cheering! I have since recomended it to many people and they all have had the same reaction. This is a keeper!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants took me by surprise. This book was really well-written. Not only does this author know how to tell a story, she educates the reader without making it unreadable. She seamlessly wove the main characters story around the unknown story of circus life during 1930s. She offers a glimpse of animal treatment, different types of jobs within and the classes that separate the workers, the expectations given by towns on entertainment, prohibition, etc. The research is evident and I welcomed and looked forward to it. The book does have romance but it has so much more depth so I read freely, not really anticipating the story between the hero and the heroine.Sara Gruen has made me a fan and has given me hope for modern writers."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had to force myself to finish this and was continually disgusted with the animal cruelty. Maybe I should have stuck w/the gut instinct that I don't usually care for historical fiction? Gruen's insight into the minds of the aging is wonderful - she should have written something focusing on that. This book could also have been about 75 pages shorter and was painfully slow at times. The writing was not \"stellar\" - I just don't see all the hype but for the millions that loved it I'm glad for you - just be prepared if you haven't read it to wince w/some of the scenes."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book in about a week and a half and I don't have much time to read. After the negative reviews, I was waiting for it to let me down but I never got there. I was interested through the whole thing and wanted to know what was going to happen next.I read it for a book club selection and was happy with the book. Not sure I want to see the movie depending on what I hear about the animal abuse. I don't think I could take it.Great read and I will recommend to others."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book in September 2007. That means I had it in my drawer for almost five years and I just kept postponing reading it (I bought it along with many other books and it took me a while to read them all; then other books got on the way and so on).  When the movie came I refused to watch it knowing I should read the book first. And so I finally made up my mind and did it. It's a great book. I'm not a circus fan but the love story is precious. It was interesting to read about the Great Depression and how hard it was to make a living. I liked the pictures inside the book. I think they were a nice touch from the author. And of course I rented the movie and watched it after reading the book. Guess what? The book is better!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you want to feel the sorrow and excitement of joining the circus and the sorrow of old age in our country, Ms. Gruen could not have crafted a better story.  The protagonist, a Polish vet student, of all things, joins the circus and therein begins the story of corrupt managment, the wonderful animals and the class system among the workers and the performers.  The reader is provided with historical information while the author paints a vivid picture of the circus train and its dynamics.  She interweaves a touching love story and a strong respect for circus animals, espcially Rosie, the elephant who only understood Polish commands! Read it - you won't be wasting your time."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book in a day. I simply could not put it down. It was so dark, with just a touch of goodness, which in itself was even complex. The love aspect of the story was so muddied, and heart wrenching, it made me feel for Jacob and for Marlena. How confusing it all was.Plus this story is based around a lifestyle we never hear about...a traveling circus. I loved Jacob, Marlena, and animals and even began to love Kinko.This book is by far a favorite, and so captivating."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have never thought of giving a book a \"content suitability for certain audiences\" rating before I read this one.  I would have to give this an \"X: Adults Only\" rating due to the explicit sexual content, violence and language which I found unnecessary for this story line.This story tells a tale of two time lines in the life of a circus veterinarian. It begins as the elderly version of the man who is forced into memories of his youth. Through the story,  he is transported back and forth between the two time lines. This is the first dual time line story that I've actually enjoyed. With the exception of the \"X\" rated parts. This is a delightful easy read. The author has a talent for description which allows the reader to easily become absorbed by the story line.  She has done quite a bit of research into circuses of the past, which helps to make the story more authentic."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was torn between two or three stars. I read this book for my book club, otherwise it is unlikely I would have picked it up considering my backlog.Personally I didn't find anything wow-ish or over the top astounding with this story. Besides that it takes place in a circus. It had its moments of course, which makes me think that what really makes you like a book is not sometimes the overall story, but a couple of scenes that really stand out. And this had a handful of those, especially those set in the present time, which were the only ones to actually pull my emotional strings, which usually doesn't take much I'm afraid, and considering that this book didn't stir much in me overall. Not even the traditional `big twist' scene riled me up. I actually read a paragraph past it then did a double take on `oh that was suppose to be it'."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I sampled this book because it's so popular and the price was right. The author's voice captured me with the authenticity of the elderly Jacob. Literally seconds after I finished reading the sample, I hit \"buy now.\" One of the most brilliant techniques in the book, and my personal favorite, is the little jolt the author created every time the point of view switches from young Jacob to old Jacob, and it makes you flinch as though you too have been wrenched from the prime of your life into the body of a decrepit codger in a nursing home.The ending is perfect and satisfyingThe scenes depicting cruelty to animals were emotionally difficult to read, though. If that kind of thing bothers you, you may not enjoy the story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A very good read!  The story as related by Jacob, alternated between the present when he's already 90 or 93 and during the 1930s when he was 23 and traveling with the circus.  It talked about loss, love, friendship (odd and otherwise), fellowship, family.  The book is full of so much emotion that even if I have not been to a circus all my life, and given that I am a woman, I was able to transport myself into Jacob's mind, and feel the story.  I just wish there was more to read after the old Jacob got himself into the circus \"train\" again."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really learned a lot about the circus, the good and bad parts, and have such a great appreciation of all of the work that goes on behind the scenes.  Plus, giving the characters a &#34;real&#34; life and personality, made it all the more interesting.  I loved Rosie, the elephant - such &#34;humanness&#34; in her attitude and loving nature.  I liked the way, as an old man, he was able to reflect and recall his vivid youth working in the circus."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I would have never believed that I would have enjoyed this book. Let alone enjoyed it to the extreme level which I did. A well respected friend recommended this book to me so I pull it up online and read the synopsis. Well, the synopsis and subject matter regarding circus life in the mid 1900's did not interest me in the least bit. Suffice to say I did not immediately read it. Only after subsequent prompting from my friend did I agree to give it a shot. That turned out to be an EXCELLENT idea. It was clear and concise reading that gave me vivid images of that era and written with short chapters that propelled me along to read just a little more each time since I was skeptical from the start. The story recounted through the eyes of an old man reminiscing his youth was pulled off seamlessly. It was like reading two stories. Now, after reading the book for myself I'm amazed at the few negative reviewer's comments. I'm reminded that some people complain about everything."}

The author does a wonderful job of alternating between Jacobs story of his life in the circus and his current life.The details of circus life, the struggles, the sadness and the happy times.I highly recommend reading this one. On a scale of 1-10 this definitely gets a 10!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "How many novels have you read about the circus? This was certainly my first and that's what I loved about it - it was something out of the ordinary. The story flowed smoothly and was full of great stories. I read a review stating that the characters weren't realistic, August was too horrid and Jacob was a coward. I definitely disagree and found most, if not all, the characters to be believable.My only complaint is the vocabulary in the novel. It seemed the author was going out of her way to use synonyms fairly close together within the plot. While I don't mind challenges to my vocabulary I didn't find it believable as if the story was really told from one person's point of view it is doubtful that they would use such extreme variety in word choices. This is nit-picking though, overall I really enjoyed the journey!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants is told through the \"90 something\" year old man in a retirement as he relives his life which came back to him when the circus comes to town.  The main character goes through some tough times and finds himself working for the circus a world he knows nothing about.  He then falls for a girl who is about as off limits as she can be.  This book is a very entertaining book that may start off a bit slow but once it picks up you can't stop reading until it's all over.  Fantastic book for a summer read!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Sara Gruen's \"Water for Elephants\" is a one of those books that fascinate you with a look inside an unfamiliar world while entertaining you. The author is very adept at spinning a yarn, creating characters that spring to life in vibrant color, and setting up simultaneous storylines that build suspense and keep you interested. She is one of the best writer's I've read when it comes to inventing villains. I look forward to reading more by this author.  On sheer writing ability, I would've given her five stars, but there were a couple of things in the story that put me off. I won't spoil it for others by pointing them out, and I would still highly recommend this book for its pure entertainment value."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for elephants is happy, sad, romantic, and exciting ,it changes from page to page. Just as something exciting happens it switches to Jacob struggling as an old man in a nursing home. There are plenty of plot twists and surprises. The book is a very detailed description of a disgusting circus in the 1930's from the illegal moonshine to straining horse trough water through a pair of clowns panty hose to make lemonade, and the red lighting (when they are thrown off of the train over a tressle) of unwanted employees.  Although the main character has some difficulty, you know it will be ok in the end because he tells it as an old man in a nursing home. During his time in the circus Jacob makes some very interesting friends, like Walter the midget clown, Earl the gentle security guard ,and Uncle Al who is way more of a jerk than he seems. Overall the book was a very exciting story about Jacob trying to survive in a circus and getting the woman he loves."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was so taken by this story when I first started reading it that I told my Mom about it, suggesting that she would love it. I was almost finished with the book when my Mom passed away. When going through her things, I found a copy of \"Water for Elephants\", and it really hit me hard emotionally, much like Jacob's feelings when his parents died (my Mom died from a neural hematoma after slipping on a step ladder). Now, almost five years later, I was able to bring myself to finish reading this wonderful tale, and I am so glad I did."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "WATER for ELEPHANTS was a quick and mostly enjoyable read for me.  The story of Jacob, a young man on the verge of his career as a veterinarian, was told as the flashback of a much older Jacob, who now resides in a nursing home.  As young Jacob was about to take his final exams and graduate from vet school, his world crumbled when his parents were killed in a car accident.  Left without family or money, a despondent Jacob jumped on a passing train.  He soon found himself working as a vet for a traveling circus.  The story of young Jacob's adventures with the circus is interwoven with the story of old Jacob's life as a resident in a nursing home.  I loved the book, but I found parts of it too graphic.  There were sexually explicit passages as well as descriptions of violent animal abuse, which I felt were overdone and unnecessary to the story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really enjoyed this book.  Water For Elephants is the story of a young man who almost becomes a veterinarian, but is too distraught over the death of his parents to sit the final exams.  After being left with nothing, he accidentally hops a circus train and is hired on as their vet.  The story of his time with the circus is told in flashbacks, and is very well done.  Love, betrayal, hope, cruelty, and compassion combine with wonderful prose and true-to-the-era settings to give you a great read.  I picked this book up on a whim not knowing anything about it, and then couldn't put it down.  Fascinating!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "At first I was hesitant about reading this book. I figured that reading about a traveling circus really wouldn't appeal to me, and I didn't understand why it was continually being suggested to me on this website. Eventually, I gave in and bought it. I pushed it aside for months, never bothering to read it, still mostly uninterested. Finally, bored one day, I picked it up and started reading. Two pages in, I didn't want to put it down.The opening is clever, leading to a fantastic ending. The writing style is charming, falling in love with the main character is completely inevitable.This is definitely on my top-ten list of novels. It is so beautifully written, I highly recommend it to anyone. It has all the mystery, love, emotion, and intrigue a novel should.I only hope the rest of her books are as lovely."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "As a devoted historical fiction reader, I thought this book would interest me. It did not. Water for Elephants reads like a children's novel, save for excessive and serious profanity, graphic and frequent sex scenes, and violence so vivid I was moved to nausea. If you are able to ignore those sorts of things, you will not find yourself feeling any kind of sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The characters do not develop over the course of the story, and seem only concerned with dabbling in vice. As a result, I was unable to identify with them.A portion of the story is written from the point of view of the main character in his old age. This writing is exceptional, and managed to keep me interested during the course of the book. Still, these marvelous little glimpses of author Sara Gruen's potential do not permit me to recommend this book to anybody. Avoid it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was a bit apprehensive about reading this book, but found it surprisingly refreshing in its approaches (spoken from two time periods) and its treatment of life as part of a circus \"family.\"  While the senior perspective was somewhat depressing, it was quite vivid of how one can be forgotten when one has so much life left to live and so much to share.  I also liked reading the excitement of the junior perspective, his trials and tribulations.  I think that both could have easily been expanded and still kept the reader's interest - wanted to know more about each character who are one and the same!  Bravo!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Could not put this book down, read from front to back and held on tight.  Without giving the good stuff away, you are there in the book at all times....amazing....wonderful.The twist on Jacob from the Bible (which you won't notice unless you read the Bible) is a grabber!We all will get old some day.....and if you are close, give this book to family members waiting to put you in a nursing home.  I think what got me the most was  \"pay attention\".I don't even want to see the movie...this was good enough for me!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a sentimental story, with quite a bit of charm. It is touted as a \"crowd pleaser\" and that is probably the reason for its huge success. You do root for the narrator, even if the plot is contrived, the ending obvious, and the characterization somewhat weak.I would have hoped for a more authentic and earthy description of a Depression-era circus, but the writing is watered down. Often the conflicts between the characters are too quickly or conveniently resolved, and the characters seem to be at the mercy of the plot. Major crises are quickly skimmed over, and the true potential of this book is never fully developed.I read this to the end--which says something--but reflecting back on the book I wish it had been stronger and more carefully constructed. 3.5 stars."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Holy cow!  What a Book!  Here we have a novel written by a woman whose lead character is a young man, er... old 93 year-old man, er... an elephant named Rosie.  Never mind.  But she does it!  She pulls it off.  The story-telling is spellbinding.  You are right there in the blackness of night, wobbling precariously on the roof of a train crossing a trestle with a knife gritted in your teeth and murder in your heart.  You love Rosie the elephant. You ache with fear and infatuation for Marlene, trapped in the grasp of a lethal psychotic maniac.Sara Gruen is a literary gem to put us in the mind and depression times of the traveling Circus's, the smell of the animals, the freaks, and the language. How about fathoming the mind of a cranky, reminiscent 93 year old coot whose character and lovable humanity hold the whole thing together?So what's next?Pierce Scranton M.D.author, Death on the Learning Curve"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I liked this book, wouldn't say it was the best one I've ever read though. The story itself was well thought out and put together with good incorporations of the flashback to 1931 and the action occurring in the present. I think right after the beginning when Jacob first joins the circus and they get the elephant is a little slow where there is not really much of a plot that has been introduced yet so it was slightly tedious in some parts in that area. The other thing is that there might have been a couple of unnecessary characters that made the story too much of a task to follow at times with all the names and who is who and such."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It has an engaging premise, characters I came to care about and it is well written.Because the setting for the story is obviously a circus Ms. Gruen gives us a great deal of information about this business. Thankfully this adds to the story and doesn't bog it down. This story showed me that the circus is as much a lifestyle as it is a business.I would recommend this book to anyone and will probably read it again - and these are the highest compliments I can give to a book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I held off reading this book because everyone I knew who had read it or was reading it loved it but kept referring to it as \"depressing\" or \"violent\" or with other strong negative adjectives.  I wasn't in the mood for a \"downer.\"  Nothing else in my \"recommended for you\" list appealed to me so I downloaded the free sample.  This book is everything everyone said it would be...violence, cruelty, betrayal, death but somehow the story grabs you and won't let go.  Told by a 90 or 93 year old vet from a circus, the story is as personal as a biography and engrossing as a news account of the circus in the 1930s.  I read it in 24 hours.  Buy, borrow it or download it...it will not disappoint!"}

It didn't sound like anything I'd ever want to read, but when a fellow book obsessed friend of mine told me that I had to read it, and I had to read it immediately, I took her advice.  Boy am I glad I did!  This book is so well written, the characters are great, and the story is absorbing.  I live near a circus museum, and am now planning a trip to visit because of this book.  I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a good story!  I've also read Riding Lessons and Flying Changes and am eagerly awaiting her next novel!"}

A few years later I read it myself and I fell in love. This book is delicious and a real treat. You will fall in love with every character and you will not want the circus to end.Even if you have watched the movie - you should read the book - it is (as always) so much more than the movie."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I bought this book on a whim at a bookstore at an airport while waiting for my flight.  I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.  I am generally not a fiction reader, but this book was so \"real\" that I couldn't put it down.  The author tells the story from the viewpoint of a 90-something year old man from start to finish.  A young 20-something almost done with veterinary school's world comes crashing down when his parents are involved in a freak accident that causes their death.  Not knowing what to do with his life, Jacob signs on to work for a traveling circus.  Not only does this book paint an accurate picture of its protagonist, but it paints an accurate historic picture of life with animals, traveling with a circus, and the time period in which the book is set.I recommend this book to anyone.  It is an easy and quick read that will impress you start to finish."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants came highly recommended from several friends but it fell a little short of great.  The writing is good, but the love story is a little lacking.  In my opinion, Jacob and Marlena did not have enough scenes together for me to truly believe that they were falling in love.  I know the title is \"Water for Elephants,\" but there was a little too much about the animals in this book and not enough about the people.  I know it was about the circus but I guess I'm the type who likes a better-developed love story if I'm going to \"buy\" it.  I don't want it to sound like I disliked this book.  I didn't.  It just wasn't a story that blew me away.  It's a nice enough read for people who like sweet, well-written books."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was hooked from the beginning and looked forward to coming back to the story each time I had to turn off my Kindle.  Coming of age in a circus might seem cliche yet the insiders view of the social dynamics that existed within a circus really put context around the whole \"running away to join the circus\" thing; although, in this case, it might be more apt to describe this as \"stumbling into the circus\".  Regardless, while I felt the end of the circus component of the story was somewhat predictable, it didn't spoil the story for me.  A truly remarkable story that I will enjoy again and again."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It is hard to find a book that can be described by these four words: Brutal, Moving, Honest and Surprising.  But Water for Elephants is just that novel.  It is not for the faint hearted, and the cruelty and squalor depicted rival some of the works of Dickens.  But also like Dickens there is a sheer honesty and redemption to be found, and as for the ending ... well I will not give anything away except to say that I did not see it coming.  An outstanding book by an outstanding writer."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have had Water for Elephants on my wish list for quite some time now...when the movie came out I thought I better read it before someone gave the ending away. As soon as I started reading the first line I couldn't stop. I caught myself hiding my kindle under my desk so I could read the next few lines and holding my breath while doing so. This book is so brilliantly written I don't even know how to review it. Sarah G. is so passionate about the animals and the characters in this book that you will find your heart breaks at certain turns and you cheer out loud for the loveable Jacob. I was so incredibly sad when it ended that I immediately ordered another book from Sarah G....The Ape House and I have to say I'm equally enthralled by it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was at a bookstore a couple of years ago holding \"Water for Elephants\" when someone came and told me that this book was depressing. Since I never liked circus and I was not in the mood to read about circus in the first place, I took that comment as a cue to not read this book.Since then, the number of 5 stars reviews has been growing and growing...I spotted \"Water for Elephants\" recently at the public library and decided to give it a shot. That woman that told me a couple of years ago that this book is depressing couldn't be more wrong. And this is not a book about circus either. Sure enough, the circus is on the background but this is basically a love story during the Great Depression/prohibition, a time in our history that we should never forget.It is very well written, with the right balance between characters development and action. It is, above all, good entertainment made to the contemporary readers."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a fantastic read. I had seen the movie and I wanted to read the book as well. I am so glad I did. Though the movie followed it very well, the book gives you more in-depth information that leads you along, their thoughts and some of the behind the scene activity that the movie could not show.Sara Gruen is a marvelous writer and so descriptive with her writing. You could almost smell the sweat of the men, the hay, the booze. You could hear the music and feel the drums pounding as the animals entered the Big Top.The story was so well told that it made you feel what Jacob felt both as a young man and as a 93-year-old man.I highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I just love it when the circus comes to our town and when I read \"Water for Elephants\" I was impressed with Sara Gruen research into several topics: the circus life and the great depression. I'm not sure how Ms. Gruen, managed to get herself into the head of a 93-year-old man but I loved the old man that narrated the story.The story is a mysterious and historical tour of behind the scenes of circus life. The deception and downright cruelty takes place. As far as I was concerned, Rosie the lovable elephant was the star of all the animals' maybe it's because I just love elephants.I won't go into detail about the story because other reviewers have already done a terrific account of the story. I would like to add that I found myself still thinking about the long suffering of the animals long after I finished the book. In summary the romantic scenes were weak but still a great story."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First of all, this book was waaaaay more sexual than I thought it would be. If you are getting it for a friend because they like elephants and the title has \"elephant in it\" DON'T DO IT (long story). This was a crazy story: funny at times and also sad at times. The story was told by switching between the past and the present, which was confusing at first, but made sense later. This style of writing kept the story moving; the shift from the old senile man to the young eager man developed the main character in such a way that it was difficult to put the book down. I enjoyed reading this book and I reflected on it for a while after I finished reading it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I enjoyed reading Water for Elephants with it's many mini stories throughout. The characters were believable - Jake as the 91 (or 93) year old and his remembering of his life as a 23 year old. Anyone who has been to the yesteryear circus will recognize the descriptions of the circus coming to town and the excitement of the residents. There are funny incidents and sad ones that make up this book and the usual good and bad characters we all encounter. I admired the 91 year old Jake for his spunk when he took charge of his life as I admired the 23 year old Jake when he did the right thing for the animals of the circus. A great story that is heartwarming too."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book! Honestly the only reason I picked it up was because of the movie with Robert Pattinson (yes, I know...I rarely justify the reading of a book with an actor).  I really enjoyed the time setting for this book and the behind the scenes look at the life of a circus worker back then.  I also liked how the entire book wasn't just a love story and how nicely it was framed within the overall novel.  This is definitely a book that I would recommend and read again! And just as a side note, the move was awesome as well!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you like adventure, romance, suspense, and excitement... read the last third of Water for Elephants. The first two-thirds set the stage for a thrilling ending, but that's all. Although Gruen's style of writing is rich with varied vocabulary and description, the elements of the first part of the plot evoke little to no emotion in the reader. Even if the author didn't spend a hundred pages building the back-story, the strange sexual elements that rear their ugly faces every few pages completely ruin the enjoyment of reading this book. If you want to spend 300 pages wondering why you're reading this story, then pick up Water for Elephants and enjoy the most boring story you have ever read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Jacob Jankowski runs away from his ivy league veterinary education when his parents die in an accident and joins a circus on impulse. His training serves him well and provides him a place of esteem among the performers and the workers, an odd position which spans both groups. He falls for the lovely Marlena who performs with the horses, but she is married to August, a violent but charismatic animal trainer. The story culminates when the circus purchases an elephant named Rosie whose intelligence hides behind her thick skin.Some of the best scenes in this book are those in the nursing home when Jacob is an old man who can't remember if he is 90 or 93. The writing is sensitive, believable, and these moments are some of the most emotional snippets from the book. That is not to say that the rest is boring. Gruen has written a real page turner, and although it is not entirely original, it is incredibly entertaining."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I took this book with me on a recent trip to South Africa and was delighted to have something to read that was so engaging that the time passed quickly. The story grabbed me from page one. It's an unusual story, beautifully written and with well-drawn characters. Although going back and forth between the past and present day was a little disorienting, I enjoyed getting to know Jacob as a 20-something and as a 90 (or 93) year old man.I really liked the device of using the prologue later in the story. And I loved the ending - it was perfect for the story, even though it's implausible and unbelievable. Sometimes that just doesn't matter. Sometimes it works anyway. Everything about this book worked for me."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants was recommended to me by a co-worker, and I was really surprised at how much I liked it. A book about a circus didn't necessarily appeal to me, but I figured it was worth a shot.This story is great. I really enjoyed the way the story alternated between Jacob in present day and Jacob's memories. In both times, he was heartwarming and sincere, even if he could be a bit cranky in his older age. :)The characters were great--well-developed and dimensional, even the ones you didn't particularly like. The whole circus feels very vivid, and I just loved Rosie to death.Overall, it was just a very enjoyable read with enjoyable characters (well, mostly, unless they weren't supposed to be). One thing that I found unexpectedly interesting was the circus dynamic--the cruelty, the hierarchy, the crazy characters. All in all, this is a very well-rounded novel and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Absolutely loved the book (audiobook actually).  And I have more than a 6th grade education.  Go figure.Not having ever been in a 1930's circus (especially since I wasn't born until 1953), I can't say whether or not the characters were true to life.  I do know and have read extensively about cruelty to animals and am not surprised this sort of thing could happen in a 1930's circus.  It was a believable story to me and loved the ending.I listened to the book on audiotape on my morning walks and I intend to buy a hard cover copy of the book because it is one I will reread again and want to keep in my library."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "\"Carried water for elephants indeed. Do you have any idea how much water an elephant drinks?\" These words of Jacob Jankowski open this well-researched, fascinating novel about circus life. This story is told by ninety-something Jacob as he vacillates between the present and the past, reflecting upon an incredible life that was not always easy, but was satisfying.Jacob finds himself in a nursing home, his mind still active and questioning the meaning of his existence. Reminiscing about his life, he searches for meaning in the bland nursing home food and the fellow nursing home occupants, most of whom have surrendered their logical minds. As he remembers his life following the death of his parents when he was in his early twenties, he marvels at how every event led to the life he had.Well-researched and accurate, many incredible facts of circus life are divulged in this story. To add to this realism, there are actual photographs from circus archives. This is one unforgettable book!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What a wonderful and delightful book! This is a look thru the eyes of a 93-year young man of his experiences with the circus mixed with today.  What an experience he had in years gone  by; what we do to our elders now because we are too busy with our own  daily lives. This has an absolutely magnificent ending...something quite unexpected and heartwarming. I hope there is a circus in town when I get to Jacob's age and my family is busy with their life. I think I would make a great ticket taker."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Written in the first person perspective, this story explains the life of an circus worker back in the old days, before any regulations were ever thought of.Rough and rugged lives wherein the guy with all the power hasn't much thought or care to the value of life - be it animal or human - but Karma wins in the end!Well written, kept my attention enough to loose sleep so I could keep reading it.As always, the book is better than the movie.  Read the book first and you will most likely understand the movie better."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was hard to put down.  This powerful story brought the pain of well developed characters to life.  Sometimes I was afraid to read on knowing what I would read would be tragic but this story was told with such beauty I had to read on.  The story is told as a life history of a gentleman living in a nursing home and the description of his days being cared for in the home are so real.  The story of the circus performers, manager and all the tragedy was gripping.  I just had to keep reading - then the ending was a complete shock.  This was one of the best books I have read recently, but I can't think of seeing the movie.  I want to remember this story as I envisioned the settings and characters while reading.  It was a great book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "To me, the mark of a good book is when you don't want to see it end. And when it does end, you can't stop thinking about it. That's how this book was to me. The characters were so richly drawn that I actually felt like they could be real people. When some of the injustices happened I had to remind myself that this was fiction. Sara Gruen writes this amazing story against a backdrop of the Great Depression and that adds so much to the story. I can't say too much about it without giving away important plot points, but I did not see the big twist coming. I'm surprised I didn't, as all the signs were there, but I was just so engrossed in the story that I didn't put them together. This is a book I will read again and again."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was a frustrating, truly awful book. While it started off interesting (a boy's parents dies and leave him nothing, and he gets caught up with a circus), it quickly became transparent and painful. He \"falls in love\" with a girl he hardly speaks to, who is married. He reacts when he should hold back and holds back when he should act. And there are far too many random, explicit, and unnecessary sex scenes. Perhaps if the author spent less time on graphic sex and more time on character development, this book would have been more tolerable. And the ending, which I was hoping would earn the book some redemption, was terribly disappointing and infuriating.My faith in the NY Times bestseller list has been ruined."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "WOW. Put this book on your MUST READ list. I bought this book because I was told my father-in-law, who recently passed away, had run away as a 13 yo child to join the circus in Europe.  He would have loved this book - he was exactly like the old, cantankerous Joseph, and probably the young one too. (Sara - did you know him?)From the moment I started it, I read straight through until I was done. I cannot remember the last time I did that.  It was just an awesome description of circus life AND the life of an old man.  It was two intertwined stories that made for a fabulous book.  Enjoy."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was part of my wife's book club. The club loved it. So, I finally picked it up and started reading it. As a quick note subject matter for a book does not matter to me. I care about good stories with great characters and this book has it from cover-to-cover.Logically, I can't think why I would want to read a story set in the 1930s about the circus, but there I was reading it night after night. It's a fascinating story with superb description that is slippery-easy to read.I don't know what your hesitation is...read this book. There are tens of thousands of worse ones out there."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book.  It was breath-taking alive - as if I could smell it, taste it and feel it.  It was like I became lost in the Great Depression era.  I so wanted it to end so that I could hear the conclusion of Jacob's life with the circus, but I didn't want it to end because it was such an enjoyable book.  I liked the way the story was narrated by Jacob as a young man and as an old man.  It is hard to believe that this was not an autobiography."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Being a born horse-lover, I have read Sara's previous books about horses.  I loved them.  When I heard she had written another book-I just had to read that too.  Her writing style is very readable.  You become immersed in the characters.  \"Water For Elephants\" is a book for all generations.  I had both my daughters read it.  We all fell in love with the main character, Jacob.  I can't say enough good things about this wonderful heartwarming book.  Highly recommend!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book in one night--couldn't put it down. There was so much to enjoy: the details of the circus, the story of Jacob, the suspense of the plot. It all drew me in and I was riveted until the end. My copy was a digital download from my library but the download was from Amazon. It included pictures from historical archives that really added a nice element of historical verisimilitude to the reading.There are several reviews on here with summaries of the book so I won't add another, I will just say if you're looking for a historically based novel that is well written and original, then this one is for you. Enjoy!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Perfect finale.  Loved every chapter.  Can't wait to see the movie!This book terrified me.  I loved it, but it really scared the *beep* out of me.  Starting off with total devastation, Jacob sets off into the great unknown following the rails.  Hungry and desperate, he jumps a train and discovers it's the circus train.  I know it's a love story and a mystery and a tale of brutality in a dangerous time in our history for men, women and animals!I love getting Twitter messages from Rosie (like my husband said, you know things are going to be OK when an elephant just tweeted you...)"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I didn't realize this was such a controversial book until I came to write my review. I liked the book. It is fast paced and an easy read. I did not like the explicit sexual scenes; I don't think they added anything, other than showing Jacob was nave, which we knew anyway. I didn&#8217;t like the animal abuse, and the fact that he was a vet and didn&#8217;t do anything about it, but if he would have he probably would have been red-lighted. The author did a lot of research about the circus in that era and it was interesting to read about some of the things that really did happen."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book based ( embarrassingly) on the attraction of the trailer. however, upon reading the book, I have to say that it outperformed my wildest expectations. I loved the characters, their imperfection and their depth.  Gruen's Narrative is vivid, exciting, passionate, and at times heartbreaking. the personalities of the animals and their role in the main characters interaction (and livelihood) in and out of the circus; are really moving.  I also found it refreshing that the main character's reasons for join the circus are not the norm. I did find the leading lady a bit flat at times, and the summation at the end left a little to be desired, but the ending was still perfect."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book is one of my all-time favorites because I loved the main character and the woman he fell in love with, but most of all, I loved the adventure of the traveling circus. Gruen had to have done a major league amount of research to learn what the circus was like in the 1920s. And my guess would be that she really did meet a man like the main character. Otherwise, how could he be so believable and so lovable?I have lent this book to several people. I know the author prefers to hear that everyone bought their own copy and I get it. But \"Water for Elephants\" is a book everyone should read."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book as one of the monthly selections for my book group.  We all loved it.  It is a human love story, an animal love story, a novel about a young man who overcomes terrible loss and a tale of survival.  As a child of parents who grew up during the Depression, I was interested in how the history of that era played a role in the plot.  I found the descriptions of the social hierarchy of circus performers, their relationships with the animals and the perspective of how they function as a sub-culture especially informative.  The author makes us, the readers, really love or hate the characters, and there were a few times when I found myself wishing I could step into a scene and protect or stand up to some of the characters.  Although the ending didn't seem quite realistic, it does fit with the hopeful dreams we all conjure up when we visit the Big Top."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This was an easy, entertaining and informative read.  I was enjoying reading this so much that I had my mom and a friend read it too on their kindle and they both loved it.  I wanted to read it for entertainment but ended up enjoying learning so much as well through the story.  I did not see the movie but now I might just to see how much justice they did to the book.  Plus I read it free from the Kindle Lending Library but it would have been worth buying!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was captivating from page 1.  The story kept a good pace and is one of those books you just don't want to put down.  I really connected with the main character and felt his emotions as if they were my own.  Other characters were both likable and despicable, but all the while intriguing.  A very interesting story and enlightening as well.  I can imagine life on a circus train during the depression and realize now that it was not all it was cracked up to be.  Highly recommend!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I did NOT expect this graphic brutality when I bought this book; circus animals killed because of lack of food or just laziness on the part of the handlers. The story starts off in an engaging way, Jake the old man in the nursing home was entertaining. But there were too many instances of animals being abused/killed that I could not finish this book as it seemed to become the main focus. Too many animals in life are mistreated as it is and I do not need this information shoved in my face via a novel. This book should come with a warning to potential readers right on the front cover."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I have seen Water for Elephants  at all the popular bookstores for the last year.  It never appealed to me, so I always passed over it.  This month, it was choosen as my book club's choice and I was pleasently suprised.  It was a true page turner and I finished the book in one weekend.  Gruen captured the time period and the secret world of circus people during the Depression beautifully.  It made me want more and to know more about the people of that era who worked on the circus trains.You won't be disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a book that grabs you from the beginning. It's a fantastic story that keeps you interested the whole way through. And it's a quick read. I just loved it so much. It's something for everyone, from the historical interest in the life of the traveling circus people during the depression, to the descriptions of old age in a nursing home. I actually insisted my husband read it when I was done. He's not an easy man to please, but had to admit how much he enjoyed it as well. I purposely don't want to say too much about the story since I enjoy reading books \"fresh\" without too much advance information. The only negative I would say is that the ending was bit unbelievable to me. But by that time everything else was so great, I didn't really care. It was as though the author was all done and didn't know how to end it. But I can forgive that."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is certainly an entertaining piece of work, one that will keep you occupied for the 4-6 hours that it takes you to read it.  Definitely not heavy lifting, but amusing and well worth the time.The story revolves around Jacob Jankowski, a 93 year old nursing home resident who \"flashes back\" to his early adult years spent in the Benzini Brothers circus.  The circus backdrop provides the opportunity to introduce numerous colorful characters and anecdotes (many of which are historical) that keep the story moving along at a good pace.The book opens with a prologue which is revisited near the end of the novel with an extremely well devised plot twist and puzzler.  I thought this was extremely well done.  The end of the novel, involving the 93 year old Jacob, was also very satisfying.All in all, a light, entertaining and easily consumed piece of work."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I must confess I had to listen to the audio version of this because I'm not allowed to open my Kindle until Christmas.  Either way, this was the best book I've \"read\" in a very long time.  I think I could understand Jacobs feelings about being in the nursing home since I had to deal with my mom being in a nursing home.  His description about sitting in the dining room was so real.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy it.  Also, it has a great ending."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I haven't seen the movie (I usually prefer the books anyway), so had little knowledge of the plot. I really enjoyed the history of how the country was during the Depression and how, basically, lawless the country still was, where people could come and go and even disappear. I enjoyed learning the levels of \"society\" within the circus and the behind the scenes look at the life of performers and workers. Life was hard in those days with no government assistance to fall back on. Aside from the window into a different time and place, the plot was interesting too."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Just finished this wonderfully colorful novel & I was not disappointed.....Once I started reading,I could NOT put it down...Loved the circus setting,strong characters and animals...Now I cannot wait to see the movie...One of the best stories I have read all year....And the author very realistically portrays what it actually means to get older...I'm not as old as the elder Jacob yet but each year that goes by,I can tell the difference in the physical abilities....If you are looking for entertainment,this book will provide it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you were a kid and experienced the train arriving, the parade of elephants, and the setting up of the big tent, this book will inform you of what went on behind the extravaganza!  I saw the performers outside with their buckets, but who would ever imagine what their lives were like?  I went to the side shows, ate the cotton candy and this book brought it all back!  This is a great novel with circus history that I fully enjoyed!  A perfect ending to those who wonder about Jacob's future!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "First the title, Water for Elephants is quite interesting. It catches my eye and has been since I saw it on the bookshelf. Finally with a copy of my own, Sara Gruen's writing style is quite detailed and specific but she has abundant of information and allows the reader to understand Jacob Jankowski, the widowed 90 year old man. In writing about the loss of his parents, he writes how he discovered that his parents mortgaged their home to send him to Ivy league college, probably Cornell University. He drops out and finds himself working at the circus by providing water for elephants. We know he was married for 60 years. The sccene in the lawyer's office discovering his parents' lack of estate was heartbreaking and typical depression era story. The fact that the great depression and stock market crash of 1929 is still relevant in today's literature. Sara Gruen makes accountability for explaining the details of Jacob Jankowski's life."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I really wanted to like this book, I really enjoyed learning some of the slang and history of the circus.  I like the circus and I was told I'd fall in love with the animals and the characters of this book.  The fact is I hated the raunchy descriptions surely we could do without those.  I felt the book to be dark, twisted and weird.  I did indeed love the animals but didn't like the characters.  Honestly - I only read half the book because of these things.  Too bad."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is my second review on Amazon.  I seriously have a lot of catching up to do.I love books about animals as I am such an animal lover myself.  The read was cool, which hotted up at the end, although a little slow moving to begin with.  In the second half I couldn't put it down, I had to know the ending as I was on tender hooks all through the time.  I guess part of this story was very emotional.  Well worth a read despite the slow beginning."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Shame on you if you ever look at an old person again and don't remember they were once young and had the world by the tail.Jacob is now ninety or ninety-three, he can't remember, and is living out his last years in a nursing home treated as belligerent and cantankerous.He sits a lot and while he sits, recalls his life in the circus.  It is an amazing and fantastic story. And so I don't write a spoiler I will simply say, I couldn't put the book down!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I LOVED this book!  The three parts I loved the most were the beginning, the middle and the end.  Great books are far and few between and I am always happy to find one I can't put down.  If you want to get to bed early or get your house work done, don't read this book.  If you don't mind drinking an extra cup of coffee in the morning and putting the dishes off until later than by all means read this book.  Soooooo good."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book did an amazing job of transporting me to another time and place. Reading it, I really got a wonderful sense of the times during 1931 as well as the brutal daily way of life for people working for a traveling circus. I loved how well the characters were developed.I would have given this book a five star rating however the main love story felt a little too obvious and tired. The underlying love story is how the main character falls in love with the circus and, more importantly, an elephant."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book was awesome!  I really couldn't put it down...one of those books where I try to get somewhere early just so I have time to read while I wait.  I bought it because I saw that the movie was coming out...and I always like to read a book before the movie.  I was NOT disappointed and now am anxiously awaiting the movie release.  I loved it how it went back and forth between Jacob's time in the circus and his life at age 94.  A wonderful love story...but it was much more than that! I highly recommend!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is a gripping story filled with both the sadness and the joy of life. Hope and regret thread through the pages gripping the reader in a heartrending but mesmerizing journey. Filled with characters struggling to choose right over wrong as well as those who are selfish and greedy, the reader will alternately lament their choices, feel their pain, sympathize with their struggles, and cheer their successes. Animal lovers beware there are some fairly graphic depictions of the way circus animals have been treated over the years. Gruen's unapologetic descriptions of circus life for all involved, the workers, the performers, and the animals strips away the romanticized idea that running away with the circus could ever be the answers to one's troubles in life. All the while, Water for Elephants also grounds us in the reality of aging and reminds us that perhaps we should listen a little and \"do\" a little less. Gruen's writing immerses the reader in a world so real the reader feels compelled to remind one's self it's fiction."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This novel is really interesting in that it explores the world of circus performers in the post depression era of the U.S.  The details are amazing and it is obvious the author took great care to create an authentic feel for the time period and life of circus performers.  A passionate love story is revealed that will capture your heart.  The reflections of an old man in the story tie it all together with wonderful sensitivity and charm.  I thought the title was really creative. I became immersed in the circus world with ease while enjoying this engaging novel."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this book. From the opening line on Chapter 1 all the way to the end, you are hooked.A young veterinary student loses is parents tragically during the time of the depression. After having his family house repossesed by the bank and no prospects, he winds up working in a circus.As stated in other reviews, there are some shaky transitions and predictable plot points. But there is a sincerity to the book that works and unique setting that makes one easily forgive the story's few shortcomings.And it's the setting that I really liked about this book. It brings back the circus of old and it made me miss it. The smell of animals and hay. The popcorn and cotton candy. The acrobats with the sequined vests. You get a wonderful \"behind the scenes\" insight to a peice of nostalgic Americana. Combined with classic dramatic elements and a motley cast of characters, this is a great book and I'm glad I got it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book is well written, well researched, and overall an interesting story. That said, without a doubt I would have closed it and never finished it due to the abuse of the animals, but I read until the end it because it was a book club choice. This is not a book for animal lovers and I found it to be incredibly painful. Those who torture animals are the scum of the earth in my opinion and I don't enjoy reading about them. Nothing personal Sara Gruen, you are a good writer."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was hesitant to read this book since it felt like everyone I knew who raved about it was a middle-aged lady and I didn't think it'd have enough action to keep my attention.  To my pleasant surprise, the writing was just brash enough to make me want to keep reading, often laughing out loud at the bizarre pseudo-autobiography.  I recommend it as a quick, easy, summer read.  Yes, a bit on the chick-lit side of the spectrum, but very good just the same."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This is a great vacation read.  The book is engaging and easy to read.  The author has paralleled the story of Jacob into a depression era love and life story that takes place in a circus.  In Water For Elephants, Jacob steals the love of another man's wife.  The man is cruel and probably mentally ill.  Jacob's heartrending moral dilemma over his love for Marlena amid all the circus characters and their individual tales forms the struggle in the novel. While the novel is character driven, it has plenty of action.  I agree with another reviewer that this book would make a good movie. I gave this 4.5 stars.  It is good not great literature."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A 90+ gentleman (sharp as a tack) in a nursing home watches from the window as a circus comes to town.  He takes us back in time to his own \"carny\" days as a veternarian for the circus animals.  So far sounds boring as heck, doesn't it?  Well, this is one old gent you come to really like.  We learn a lot about the shenanigans behind the scenes of the circus as well as the plight of those during the depression.  Again, sounds boring.  But this author makes it a story you can't put down.  This is a testament to a great writer.  I believe she could make the phone book interesting.  JUST READ IT !!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was given this book by a friend that insisted that I read it, \"It was fabulous\".  I read about 100 pages of it and set it down which is something I rarely ever do.  A couple months go by and I was at a party where a couple people again said what a great book it was.  I decided I had to give it another try so I picked it back up and continued to read it.  At the end, I still don't understand the love of this book.  I didn't care for the animal brutality and I just never connected with the characters in this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I give this book a 2.6.  All those people Jacob's father helped in that little town and no one came forward in his time of tragedy?  It just didn't seem realistic to me.  Someone from immigrant stock with the pluck and drive to get into Cornell vet school is not likely to founder in this situation, nor just dismissively to walk away from his final exams.  Jacob wasn't a pampered trust fund baby; he'd probaby had it a bit rough all along. The rest of the story is just a contrivance built upon an unbelievable premise."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had not read Sara Gruen's work when my book club decided to read Water for Elephants...now I am a big fan! The writing is clear and engaging, the story is filled with vivid characters (including Rosie the elephant), and the action is well paced. Gruen seamlessly interweaves the story of an aging ex-circus vet and his recollections of the exciting (and often dangerous) road show days. With her interesting research into the carny heyday, Gruen transports the reader into another world, including the fascinating vocabulary of the performers and roughnecks. A lovely story!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved this book. While it has history it is not a dull history book and the history is indeed interesting. The book details the lives of different people enveloped in the gold rush from a wonderful clergy man ,a young Irish woman with a keen sense for business, successful and not so successful miners plus those who went there with no knowledge of mining or life in the very rugged north.The book is very well written and weaves the history, the town of Dawson, and the individual characters together seamlessly."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "To me Hemingway epitomizes the hard drinking, hard living, hard loving, worldy writer. In this book, the main character Robert Jordan is a soldier send on a mission to the hills of Spain to blow up a bridge. There, Jordan meets up with a rogue band of warriors who believe in war but not in military. Once united with the militia, Jordan becomes involved with a woman named Maria. The fight scenes are incredible. The ending is even more incredible. I'm not going give away the book, but the ending  brought tears to my eyes- I guess it's true, underneath every man of steel is a heart of gold."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For Whom the Bell Tolls takes the reader on a three and a half day journey starring Robert Jordan who is assigned with blowing up a bridge. He is in Spain and the fighting is between fascists and the Republicans (Robert Jordan&#8217;s side). It accounts his time with a group of guerrilla fighters.While the writing drags on at times and in the beginning it is difficult to tell what or whom the dialogue is between, it is a pretty good book. Topics such as love &#8211; between Maria and Jordan, the psychology of soldiers, and who God is are covered in this book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What could be better than Hemmingway?  More Hemmingway.I learned about this short epilogue on the program \"Hemmingway in Cuba\" was broadcast April 6, 2013 on my local pbs station.  There is a joint effort by Cuban and American scholars to preserve all the materials left at his home in Cuba.  I am not a scholar, but want to share this with other readers of Hemmingway.This Epilogue for \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" was found in the basement of Finca Vigia.EpilogueIt was night when Golz rode in a staff car on the road down from the pass to El Escorial."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I learned a very important lesson here; take a good peak at the book before you get it. The Scribner publication (paperback) of this Hemingway Novel wasn't the one I believe most people read. This was spattered everywhere with \"Thee\" and \"Thou.\" That really detracted from the story. Unfortunately I don't think even with out that distraction the story wouldn't have been much better. It also would have helped me had I known more about the bigger picture. I'm not that familiar with Spanish history and wasn't sure who represented what. Also a strange personal quirk; I keep thinking of the protagonist Robert Jordan, and transposing him in my mind with Di Vinci Code protagonist Robert Langdon. I guess it's the common name Robert."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "My first Hemingway was Men Without Women, a collection of short stories, and I was so bored with it. After that, I pretty much put Hemingway on my black list, because if I couldn't stand his short stories, there's no way I'll get through a whole novel. Man was I wrong. I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend. All I can say is wow! This book is truly beautiful; the characters, the scenes, and all the emotions that goes with it.The whole story takes place in 4 days. It's about a man who's on a mission to blow up a bridge and to do so he needs to work with the local guerrillas.

I look forward to checking out his other novels as well."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "For Whom the Bell Tolls is a Hemingway less affected by his modernist tendencies than To Have and Have Not yet not as uninfluenced as The Old Man and the Sea. Also, there is a good deal of sexual discussion and activity, though all of it is done in an explicit-yet-entirely-implied manner exclusive to Hemingway's style. This story of the American professor who joins the Spanish Communists in their fight against the fascists explores love, morality, Communism, duty, awareness of death, and bravery in the face of death. Specifically, impending doom expedites and deepens the life and love of the characters.  A good first read but not necessarily worth a return."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This novel brings one into close contact with the forces in dreadful conflict during civil war--Solidarity versus Brutality; Hemingway portrays both thoroughly. The story told by Pilar in this book seemed to haunt me  for a few days, the images were so clear, and as one will find by reading  it, it is a story which has a very grave lucidity, as if you wished  Hemingway would drown the scene in a sea of lifeless and complex words.  The descriptions of the love story and Jordan's internal motivations  immediately soothe the unsettling images of war, and the novel as a whole  works paradoxically to the point where both sets of images collide, and  leave the reader both unsettled and fulfilled simultaneously."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I tried to get through it, I really did.  But then I remembered what a chore it was in High School when two of his novels were required reading.  It bored me stiff then, and it does now.  But I have found that with Hemingway, he's either your cup of tea, or he isn't.  The characters are shallow, and I don't like his writing style, in any of his stories.  Personal choice, to each his own.  As the reviews show, some love it, some don't.  I don't.  But at least I won't resort to name calling like some reviewers do, when someone doesn't share their opinion.  If you've never read it, give it a try, you may love it.  If you don't, its not indicative of your intelligence level as some would have us believe."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I love almost all of Hemingway's novels, but this one was a daunting effort.  Line by line, or a paragraph at a time, the writing is Hemingway at his best.  Yet, inexplicably, I found that as one chapter segued interminably to the next, the story and style became muddled and could not sustain my interest.  There is much, however, that is worth the time...themes of monogamous love, war/conscience, life/death.  The heart wrenching finale illustrates the notorious he-man's mastery to convey softer, &quot;feminine&quot; sensitivity.  Definitely not the one to kick off a reader's Hemingway exposure."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I revisited this book in my early 40's and came away resold on Hemingway as one of America's greatest writers and an artist who stands the test of time. It's a shame, in fact, that Hemingway's caricature-friendly persona, life and writing style have sometimes obsured his work. Forget the macho image and the stories of drinking and hunting. He is an artist of the first order.For Whom... is a novel about the important things -- life, love, death, fear, the attraction and horror of war. What struck me throughout was how innocent the characters are and how genuinely Hemingway depicts the most difficult subjects, be it war (in this case the Spanish Civil War) or the love between Maria and Robert Jordan.Hemingway is a writer we need in our times. He focuses on the big, important issues without cynicism, and never shies from exposing what is in our hearts and minds. A classic."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I did not care much for the story.  It was before my time so I have no connection to the events. The big looser for me was the writing style. It was probably a well accepted style at the time but just does not fit in today. Hemingway changed his style several times in his life and this is just an example of a style that went astray.I enjoyed &#34;The old man and the sea&#34; which was written quite differenty. The fact that there was only one person involved made a difference."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This story is a classic. It details events that occurred during the Spanish civil war of the late 1930s when fascism was on the rise in Western Europe.In 1944, in my adolescent romanticism, I had become immutably bonded to the characters and Ingrid Bergman after seeing the movie that had just come out.Now, 70 years later and reading the details of the love affair, I was to discover that I understood practically nothing of the historical significance in which the story takes place. The atmosphere of the guerrilla cave and escapades left a deep impression on me that was never to be forgotten.Should you read this novel, I might suggest that seeing the movie first might place the characters most strongly in their rightful desperate and fateful surroundings as so skillfully described by the author."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book gathers momentum slowly, but I guarantee that if you stick with it to the end you will be very well rewarded.  I enjoyed this book for insight into history as well as military tactics.  It's almost like you are behind enemy lines, eavesdropping on what is happening.  But the last 40 to 50 pages swiftly gathers momentum both in action and emotional impact. But intertwined is this heart-wrenching love story, at least at the end it's heart-wrenching.  I've read four of Hemingway's books, but this one ranks easily at the top.  There is so much emotion and character in this book, the stuff that makes us human and heroic, and that makes Hemingway so great.  The last 40 pages or so builds so much emotion, suspense, and excitement you cannot put it down--the mission climaxes, the love story climaxes, what a ride!!!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It's hard to write a a concise review for this wonderful novel that would begin to capture the emotion and vitality within its pages. Read the Amazon description for a plot summary; but don't be fooled into thinking it's a black and white story about the Spanish Revolution.  Hemingway has an amazing way of capturing the sheer humanity of the whole undertaking.  The Reds, the fascists, the anarchists and the uncommitted are all examined and ultimately shown as being human beings first, and political creatures second.At the same time it is the ultimate war novel and love story.  Hemingway delves into Jordan's perspective of the characters and is vivid in his description of the Spanish countryside while also maintaining a near stream of consciousness of intelligent thoughts.  The simultaneous vitality and fatalism of the characters is amazing.  Truly a wonderful book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Hemingway has a way of getting into our heads.  The characters are plain spoken; almost Shakespearean at times; with  powerful, philosophical paragraphs sprayed in.  His interest in bullfighting is obvious if you have read any of his work; and is not ignored here.  Against the rules of writing he uses the Spanish tongue; although irritating, he gets away with it.Set in the mid 1930's, and centered around an American munitions expert fighting to help the cause of removing the Germans, Italians, and the rest of the fascist armies from out of Spain.  He links up with a group of cave dwelling partisans outside of town.  Much of the book is spent on his relationship with this group and him falling in love with a young girl, whom he can never have.Some may object to the ending, but I found it fitting; \"I man's gota' do, what I man's gota' do\"Wish you wellScott"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Having recently come back from Paris, I went through a Hemingway phase, starting with his memoirs of his Paris days, then I stumbled on this book.The stumbling was a fortunate accident, for this book is amazing.  Hemingway's short but powerful prose is in perfect form. I actually find  Hemingway and Gabriel Garcia Marquez similar in their ability to capture a  thought completely in one sentence- even though their actual sentences are  different.Hemingway perfectly captures poignant emotions, and the  sentence sparsity adds to the strength and description beautifully.I  also agree with one of the other reviewers above, in that my appreciation  is probably helped by age. A lot of the emotions of loss, doubt,  disillusion and love I only felt in my post high school years. It's a good  adventure story nonetheless, but might lose its power for a youger  audience."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Well, I'm embarrased to say that it took me until late in life to finally get around to reading this gem. And oh, what a gem it is. Robert Jordan is one of those characters that just stays with you. I found myself a bit envious of his adventure, at least for a while (don't want to give anything away). For me, having never fought in a war, the sense of romanticism, mingled with the clear tragedy, seemed a realistic picture of what it must be like.Ultimately, I admire the sense of duty and honor so many of these characters display, and I wonder how many people share that kind of personal commitment today. I like to think it's still a high number (certainly we see it our military men and women), but I can't help but wonder.......This book is a 5-star read all the way around. Read it. You won't be sorry."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "You understand you have to like Hemingway. This work embodied his distinct style of writing, the spare, yet eloquent manner that is known as his. Hemingway's ability to saddle every word with meaning and emotion is at it's ripest in this work, where he writes a war story that encompasses the entire spectrum of the human experience, form love to hate, spite to sacrifice. While the Spanish Civil War included tens of thousands, Hemingway writes of a handful of people who represent the whole of the country. Heroes do not always win in Hemingway's world, but in their defeat, they do win. The bravery and ultimate sacrifice of the protagonist captures that bitter fact of life. This novel has a meaning and lesson that can only be appreciated and understood by those who have read it. It would be a loss not to."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I had to write this review because of the review someone else wrote...This person said it was about Hemingway's support for anti-communists and young americans going over to Spain during the civil war to fight the communists...He must not have read the book.  The main character of the book went to fight against the FASCISTS, not the communists.  He hated fascism and wanted to stop the fascist regime from taking Spain.  Fighting on his side were many communists, or Spanish backed by communist nations, such as the spanish generals trained by the communist Russian nation, so how on earth this reviewer could think it was against communism if he read the book is beyond me.  Also, this book is about much more, it explores moral issues and covers themes from love to the truth of war.  Hemingway really makes you see the tragedy and pointlessness of war."}

As I am sure was Hemingway's intention, you can literraly reflect on that poem back through every single chapter in the book, and each time the poem will have a new meaning for the reader.  This is a true sign, in my opinion, of a great author.  I need to read this novel again, to pick up on some of the hidden inuendos and nuances I might have missed the first time, but that too will be time well-spent.This is a phenomenal book, by a bona fide, talented classic author.

{"label": 5, "raw": "A really wonderful book about the city of Delhi. Dalrymple and his wife go to spend a year living in Delhi (how did they afford this?), and he uses this arrangement as a way of chronicling the present day status of the city  and delving deep into its history. He's done a very nice job of moving back  and forth between present and past, managing to keep all his meetings and  interviews with various experts quite interesting. The only part which lost  my interest was an extended look into Sufi mysticism, but I just skimmed it  and moved along. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in India,  and especially to anyone planning a trip to Delhi."}

William Dalrymple paints a picture full of humor and fascinating detail, mixed with love and frustration.  Which is what Delhi is: fascinating, frustrating, fun, and full of incredible people.  Delhi is multi-layered and not easily explained.  Delhi has to be experienced. Yet, Dalrymple brings to life a lot of the feeling of this magnificent city.  More importantly for me, he brings to life part of its history, details history books leave out, alley ways that deserve to be explored.  As a traveler blessed to return to Delhi fairly often, I have found the details of Dalrymple's book adding value to my visits - by knowing which alley ways might just be explored."}

In doing so, he succeeds in bringing out the secret lives of the eunuchs, passionate pigeon fights in Old Delhi, the wild rule of William Fraser in the jungles of Mehrauli, the frivolous codes of the decorum practiced in Mughal period, the popularity of the Sufi saints and their powers and much more to help you envisage the rich heritage of the city."}

She will love it as much as I do, I predict. The layers of the city are peeled back through Dalrymple's sensitive approach to history and culture, and the reader is transported to places and times that are long gone, as well as those that are contemporary. Walking through the streets of New Delhi and Old, the reader feels as though the City has come alive in some other dimension.

Eventually Penick became widely respected and many notable players and duffers stopped over to visit him at the practice tee. Over time, the wooden shafted golf clubs gave way to titanium steel.I certainly enjoyed the historical perspective that the book provided. Although some golf instruction is included in the book, it is more of a nostalgic look backwards to days spent in the Texas sun mowing the lawns and watering the greens. Reading a book like this is not a bad way to spend an afternoon. Harvey Penick had a good life.If you are searching for a serious golf instruction manual, however, you may want to choose another book."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I read this book many years ago, when I was 13. At the time I was into much younger books for younger readers, but my college aged sister introduced me to this one - and I was totally hooked. A love of historical fiction and gothic romance followed, and I read all of Victoria Holt's novels. There was no end in sight after that, and today, 27 years later, I often wonder where I would be without Victoria Holt. I recommend this book to all young adults. It will introduce you to a whole new world, one of reading."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book actually should be under one of Victoria Holt's other pen names, Jean Plaidy.  Plaidy writes about actual historical figures.The Queen's Confession is told by Marie Antoinette herself.  Well, not actually, but how she would have written it.  She grows up in the Austrian court under the guidance of her mother, the Empress Maria Therese.  She marries the Dauphin of France and deals with the &quot;uncrowned queen&quot;, Madame du Barry.  Finally, she becomes queen and started the beginning of the end of the French monarchy.  Scandal, intrigue, and flamboyancy were never as great, and the consequences are even greater.This book was wonderful!  I actually learned a lot about her (I thought I knew everything!).  Also, it is a good book to read if you are in for a good cry."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I was looking out over the ocean and I thought of this book that I had read 30 years ago. I went over all the details in my mind that I could remember and wished I still had this book to read. I grabbed my mac and went to amazon.com in the hopes of finding a copy. I read all the reviews and I was amazed at how many women are out there who remember this book as I do. The other reviews are all accurate. In one scene Jullitta and Adam are on the run. They are in getting ready to go to sleep and she tells him that if she ever calls him husband he will know that she is his. Which really matters at a later time. There are deer flapping at the oat cakes they were going to have to breakfast, and wild painted scots bent on murder. It's really a beautiful story. I hope they offer it on kindle soon."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "It seems cruel to review this book because you can't get it anymore.  My old copy is held together with rubber bands.  I liked everything about it.  All the characters were wonderful; the history was accurate; the mystery and intrigue were mysterious and intriguing.  The secondary characters were almost better than the main characters.  Good wasn't always pretty and Evil was evil with reasons and, sometimes, even strengths.  You could hiss the villians and cheer the good guys but you knew that these people lived and you mourned and rejoiced with them.  When the hero finally wins his lady's love, it's a timeless moment. Her love is an achievement...not a casual tumble in the normal historical bodice ripper.  My only complaint about this book was it was too short and there's never been a sequel.  If you can find a copy, read it - you'll love it."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I am thrilled to see others know how good this book is!  I read this years ago and kept the copy for a long time.  Then because I was crazy I got rid of my copy.  I kept thinking about it though and a few years ago paid about 40 dollars for a used copy.  Money well spent!  I read this book at least once a year and enjoy it every time. I keep hoping it will be reprinted so more people can enjoy reading about Adam and Julitta. There is something romantic about a man literally having some sense knocked into him.  Unlike so many romances of the time that had the love interest fight each other to the end then suddenly they are in love, Ms. Ingram gradually brings Julitta from  dislike, to grudging respect, friendship and then love.  All this while the Scots are over the border, there is disloyalty in the household and treason is afoot.  This it a great read!"}
{"label": 5, "raw": "When I first started reading this book, I was bored, but by the time I finished it, I loved it!  Nora's mother abandoned her, and her father died mysteriously in search of gold in the Outback of Australia.  Her guardian, the Lynx, sends his son, Stirling to fetch her and bring her back to Australia.  On their way out of England, they &quot;accidentally&quot; stop by Whiteladies, and old castle inhabited by a young lady, Minta (isn't that at pretty name?), her parents, and her governess.  From there, they go to Australia.  Once there, Nora meets Lynx, seemingly half-man, half-god.  She also finds strange coincidences between the estate in Australia and Whiteladies, including the name.  Nora finds herself in the middle of a feud.  If her life isn't already mixed up, she must also choose between Stirling or Lynx."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Hard to describe this one.  I can't really put my finger on it, but this book is a bit too out there for me.Ms. Holt takes us through a journey with a young lady who has been orphaned.  She finds herself being taken from the country she has grown up in and taken to a foreign land.  She falls in love with the man that her father worked for but not before she makes him a fortune and not before she falls in love with the same man's son.It doesn't hurt that the family is very rich and she has come from a very poor background."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "What an unbelievable work of art.  This book not only grabs you and pulls you in, with wonderful characters and writing, but you find yourself lost in the time and place.  I am currently about a fourth of the way through War and Remembrance....it is equally splendid.  I first read Marjorie Morningstar and fell in love with Herman Wouk's style and mastery of the storyline and character development.  At times when reading these books I am incredibly sad, other times uplifted, and yet other times amazed.  Absolutely one of the best authors I've ever read...and I have read alot of books."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The story takes us and the Henry Family from 1939 to 1941.  We see how the coming war changes members of the Henry family and their friends.  We meet some of the important people who shaped the world and led us into War.  We participate in the invasion of Poland and learn who the war changed the lives of those who were involved.  Some characters face terrible challenges and rise to the occasion and others fail.  Hitler was not a nice person.  Read the book and watch the miniseries.  It was interesting to see the attitudes of many Americans before the war and others in Europe how they thought things were going."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I go from historical romance novels to historical fiction to non-fiction but easy-to-read history.  Each of them has its own slant on perspective about that era, ranging from history-as- wallpaper to up-close rendering, as if you were there.  This is one of the very few novels that manages to combine the elements of all 3 kinds of those books into a very gripping reading saga of WWII.  So you are given well researched history in a very palatable form. It follows an interrelated cast of characters all over the map with WWII, taking us deeply into the critical locales. There is even a fascinating account given by a German general, interspersed throughout, of the war as seen through the opposite side's eyes. Wouk does an incredible job and his sequel, &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; is almost as goood."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "If you were one of those students that was doodling during American History or, more likely, by spring when WWII was covered, was thinking of other things as the teacher sped through the entire event in two periods, this is an wonderfully enjoyable way to get the history you missed. Following two families, this historic fiction offers insights into WWII that no textbook could. It opens in early 1939 and closes with Pearl Harbor, describing events in London, Europe, Washington and the Pacific. The book includes an enormous amount of factual data on actual events and individuals who played a significant role during the period. Additionally, it very effectively employs the device of reports written by a fictitious German general, to provide the German perspective on the war effort there. All in all an excellent book that should be required reading for anyone that feels they know too little about the period. And the sequel, War and Remembrance (which I am now reading) is an excellent follow up, continuing to track the characters throughout the remainder of the war."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This book, and it's companion, \"War and Remembrance\" are two of my favorite novels of WWII. I read/re-read them about every ten years. I find them exceptionally well written with clearly drawn characters who enter the traumic period of Western civilization's march through the use of the industrial model for the destruction of millions of people and an end to traditional European colonial powers. I find myself caring about the characters, their losses, and how they delt with a world bent on destruction; characters trying to balance traditional values while creating new beginnings from the ashes of a world focused on self-destruction and death. I have read most of Mr. Wouk's books and have been a fan of his writings for many years. You will not be disappointed."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "He's a most utterly unappealing protagonist.  Wouk wants us to think of Pug as a career-driven, very rigidly moral sort of person.  Instead, he came across to me as cold, humorless, stodgy, somewhat hypocritical, and very, VERY boring.  The few things Wouk has him do to make him less of a plaster saint (drinks a bit, smokes, lusts in his heart after a young English woman) didn't humanize Pug for me.  By the end of the novel, I found him about as likeable as Wouk's other famous character, Captain Queeg.That said, the plot of the novel was engrossing and most of the other characters (Including Hitler and Stalin!)were more interesting and entertaining than Pug.The definite highlight of the book is Wouk writing as the German General van Roon.  It's very convincingly done and it is in these sections of the book where what little (sly) humor Wouk offers is to be found."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I feel like I stepped into the 1940's and I was right ther with Pug and Rhoda. This is the most detailed and accurate novel on WWII that I have read.The charachers are so alive. This Navy family are scattered all over Europe and the US in WWII. You go from desk jobs to the trenches in Russia. Briney the youngest son marries a Jewish woman who is living in Siena, Italy so you can guess where that leads.You read the horrors of Hitlers Final Solution. All the military planning and battles and the tender moments between husbands and wives.The Kindle edition did have many typo's in it. I did report it and was assured that it is being corrected.This is a great read and it is so much easier to read on the Kindle as it is a BIG heavy book.I highly recommend it to anyone who loves WWII drama."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Extremely insulting that no one ever proof reads books after conversion to kindle format.  While the kindle edition appears to have undergone some clean up after so many negative reviews for a chapter to have \"Bearl Barbor\" as the title is beyond belief.  There are many other conversion errors with improper character recognition but I did not track those.  A few problems with hyphenation also remain where the printed edition used hyphenation as a means to word/line wrap but the after conversion to kindle the hyphen is no longer appropriate since the line wrap occurs at a different point in the line.  There are a few graphics from the printed version also scanned into the kindle edition and therefore of poor quality.  Can only imagine how bad War and Remembrance kindle edition must be since that title has been unavailable for many months while awaiting correction."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I loved the mini-series so decided to give the book a go.  The TV series covered all the most important things from the book, but as usual there is much detail in the book that there was not time for in the series. This book is a good bet for  anyone who loves an engrossing story about a very important time in the history of mankind.  I learned a great deal that I never knew before, and I fancy myself somewhat of a history buff.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "A reader does not need to have a special interest in war stories to enjoy this novel (along with its continuation in War and Remembrance).  This is a very well-written story that puts a personal face on World War Two.  Even though The Winds of War adn War and Remembrance is one coherent stroy covering over 2000 pages, the story never bogs down.  Spans events from the lead-up to the end of the war and follows the main characters all over the world.  Wouk does a great job of writing from various perspectives.The history seems to be fairly accurate, with some necessary literary license taken to covey the sheer volume of information required as the backdrop for the main characters.  You wouldn't read this to replace history works, but it really humanizes the events of the war."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I consider myself very picky when it comes to books. They have to be pretty exciting and well writting to hold my attention. Maybe I have A.D.D. or something. As the other reviewer said, there is a little \"they know we know that they know\" business in this book, but that didn't stop me from zipping through this book in about 2 days. I  give this book 5 stars because the style of writing just allows you to literally sprint through the pages without realizing you're even reading. it's seamless, and a breeze to read. i never once stopped to question something he wrote, and never once felt like i was \"outside of the story\". i'll be purchasing more of his books pronto."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "They just don't write mysteries like Alistair MacLean did anymore. This is one of my all time favorite books. I first read my dad's copy as a teen, and was excited to find this edition, the same as the original I read, on Amazon.The story is gripping and engaging, and the twist at the end (a signature MacLean move which he save literally to the last page... no cheating!) will have you going back and re-reading it just to experience the story with that knowledge!The book was in excellent condition when it arrived - thank you seller."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "The whole Patrick O'Brian are works of art and will grab you for Captain Aubrey's entire career.  Interesting to note how many obstacles he overcomes as he climbs the ladder of command in the Royal Navy.  Its a good primer for young folks starting a career; it is not always a rocket path to the top.  You will encounter traditions, rules, and technology that impede your goals; and one has to be a risk taker.  Again and again Aubrey takes risks, rallies his seamen, and prevails.  One wonders if a personality like Aubrey would be tolerated in our risk aversion US Navy today."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "This series is really more like one long novel than a serialization. Again we find Lucky Jack Aubrey land bound and hoping for a command. Like in all the others he soon receives his hearts desire and the rest as they say is history. The semi accurate revisionist history is pleasing. The use of the archaic Royal naval jargon is like learning another language. If this installment we see more of Dr. Maturins true vocation as a spy. I highly recommend this installment to anyone who has read any of the past books."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Once again,Patrick O'Brian bats a home run. The author manages to make day-to-day - in fact a minute to minute - life aboard a Napoleon-era man-of-war seem like it is happening contemporaneously. And a very exciting life it is too. Aubrey's skill as a mariner is amply displayed, as are the machinations of .Maturin. I used to think the C.S.Forester's Hornblower was the ultimate in sea stories of that era, but his skill has been supplanted, in my view, by O'Brien. If you like sea stories you will love this one."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "I'm reading these books in series and I've just recently finished The Mauritius Command. I've given all the books in this series 5 stars. The title of my review suggests that this book is a departure from the first three. This is true, but I do not want to overemphasize that point. We get here all the things we expect from an O'Brian Aubrey novel. What is different is simply the amount of time spent on the various actions. In this book, I missed more of the intimate moments between Maturin and Aubrey, playing their instruments, fretting over money, and so forth. However, this does well perhaps to put us in the mind of Aubrey for this adventure.Readers of the other novels will not be disappointed here. And of course, the quality of O'Brian's writing cannot be overstated."}
{"label": 5, "raw": "Aficionados of O'Brian's seafaring novels from the Napoleonic Wars all have their favorites.  Of the 20 Aubrey/Maturin novels, this one may be the best in many ways.  Captain Aubrey's career seems on the fast track (maybe fast tack, given the theme)in this episode in which he takes the rank of Commodore and sails a small fleet to wrest Mauritius from the \"foul and most foreign French.\"His companion, Dr. Stephen Maturin comes into his own in this episode, showing his full talents as an intelligence agent and giving an idea of the resources at his command.  There are setbacks, of course but the combimnations of land and sea warfare are engaging.  Many of the other staple charcaters of the series also really begin to bloom in this installment.If you have come this far in the series, do not hesitate:  buy this adventure and sail forth.  May the weather gauge be with you!"}

They could  have put some better songs from the bands though. Especially from Godsmack,  Lit, and Metallica. Basically, the video was not bad."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "For those of you guitar music lovers, (mostly men, I guess), this is a great intro to three of the biggest names in guitar-centric music. More importantly, this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "G3 Live in Concert is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen!  Not only does it have the best guitarists on the planet but they all get to jam together at the end!!  Their virtuosity is a sight to behold!!  I am a fan of all three guitarists and I was in heaven when I saw this DVD chronicling their incredible talents!  Now don't get me wrong there are many fantastic guitarists out there but this concept of getting premiere players together is a great one!Their styles are so different yet you can see the mutual respect that exists among them as they all play together!If you're into guitars or guitar playing you'll be in heaven watching this DVD!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Honestly, all individuals are born different from the other. In G3's situation the 3 of them have their own distinctive feeling & style in playing that would obviously lift you up from your seats and scream out loud the word \"Yeah\". That is why I would not and could not classify who is ranking no.1, 2, or 3 among them. Unless, if your head is inflated with fowl air then approach me and I'm 100% willing to deflate your pathetic medical case and grant you guarantees of cure comprise of \"Love & Respect\". Buy this Dvd because your in for a special treat."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you are not an instrumental rock'n roll fan and your blood doesn't boil with some extreme overdrive and other guitar effects, this is not for you. If you are a rock guitar player, this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai, as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza, deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson, I have to say, has a very different personality, melodic approach, and technique from Vai and Satriani, but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "To anyone who, like me, only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death, this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program, giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here, all the banter between  songs, the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent, two seperate sound  mixes, regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wow, this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan, and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert, even if you dont know Jeff, is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album, and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great, try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been familiar with Herbert von Karajan and the singers on this DVD for a long time before finally seeing them in action, and I must say, not one of them failed to impress, and each one of them is just as amazing as I had always expected.  This is absolutely one of the greatest productions of Don Giovanni, which just happens to be my favorite opera, in this whole world.  Von Karajan seems to be still at the peak of his power with the baton, and I just cannot say enough great things about the cast, especially Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Samuel Ramey, Julia Varady, and Kathleen Battle. This is a must-have in the collection of any opera/Don Giovanni lover!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I enjoyed this production of Don Giovanni, even though there are some aspects I did not like. The musicianship of everyone was excellent. The opera proceeded at a good pace. However I found the constant darkness overwhelming, even though the light background showing the city was very well done. Similarly almost all costumes were black, as if everyone, no matter what was happening, was dressed for a funeral, even those celebrating the wedding between Zerlina and Masetto. Although that is not their fault, Donna Anna, Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira appeared too old to make their passionate roles believable. The parts of Leporello and Don Giovanni were acted excellently: Leporello a servant, ambivalent, who enjoys, but then also dislikes his role; Don Giovanni: a very charming seducer, who can also be cruel, who does not care at all about the effect of his actions on others."}

And I really can't say that with all Elmo's world shows. This video opens the way to talk to young kids about babies, dogs and farms. Which is great. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Elmo's World - Babies, Dogs & More! seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly.

Watching the little kids play with the babies is my favorite part, and it really gets my daughter's attention.  All in all I do recommend this DVD.  It shows alot, but isn't too fast paced.  Also, there are some very adorbale scenes.  But by the time the farm segment starts my daughter has usually lost interest."}

Elmo learns about what babies eat, how they behave and the joy they bring to their families.Then Elmo learns about dogs and how to feed and take care of them.  Mr. Noodle is along as he does one of his usual silly routines as he walks a pretend dog much to Elmo's and kids delight.The last part of the DVD deals with farms as Old Macdonald joins the fun teaching Elmo all about life on a farm.  Elmo learns about taking care of farm animals and growing vegetables.

{"label": 6, "raw": "This movie couldn't make up it's mind if it wanted to be a sex comedy  along the lines of AMERICAN PIE or a romantic comedy akin to SHE'S ALL  THAT.  It had the potential to be good whichever way it went, but it never  lived up to it in either one.  The sex jokes were uninspired and the  situations felt awkward and forced.  The romance wasn't really emphasized  and just not done very well, I felt.  Normally, you're rooting for the boy  to get the girl, but, in this film, I didn't really care.  I felt nothing  for the characters; I didn't even find myself rooting against the  &quot;villain&quot;.  Be it the writer's or the director's fault, it was  just very badly done.  The acting was decent and the dialogue was well  written, but the story development just left me feeling flat.  Disappointing."}

Miles below She's All That Never Been Kissed and American Pie and yes even worse than Can't Hardly Wait and the horrifying Melissa Joan Hart disaster You Drive me Crazy, Whatever it takes is boring an inept from start to finish. 2 guys join forces to help eachother get the girl of their dreams. 1 girl is the jock guy's cousin.

Firedance is much better in it's original version where it's performed by a man and a woman.2.  I don't see why the Trading Taps needs to be included.  However, this is not to say that the tappers are not incredibly talented, they're just not Celtic!3.  For the same reason I've never really liked the Russian Dervish dance!4.  I also don't care much for \"Slip Into Spring.\"5.  And the original version of \"Lift The Wings\" is by far the best!6.  Colin Dunne is no Michael Flatly.Now, for the two changes that are good.1.  The narration at the start the talks about The Sun!  Yay Lugh!2.  The number called \"Heartbeat Of The World.\"  It's very good!"}

Though there are a few segments that seem out of place (a flamenco dancer, a sequence featuring a black ensemble), most of the video is made up of dance numbers using traditional instruments and footwork from the Emerald Isle.  When I first watched it I was blown away.  I still am.  If you have only *one* dance performance video in your collection, this should be it."}

They tell how to know you need to go, and explain that sometimes there are accidents, but that it is worth it to wear underwear instead of diapers.  There are some real children who talk about how they love going to the toilet.  And a very strange shadow puppet rap showing that people all over the world go to the toilet.  Don't know about results yet, but at least it is an entertaining video."}

Now, he grabs himself and says POTTY and runs to the bathroom. Before he was using a potty chair, now he only uses the toilet (I think because he saw Tutter using the toilet). Aside from the potty training he loves the singing and he loves all of the animals on the show. I also recommend Bear in the Big Blue House: Colors and Shapes.

It's amazing to see that the whole recording was done in \"real\" time, as there were no overdubs or retakes (seemingly, anyway).  The vocals and the musicianship are totally top-notch.So, what made me buy the film was the Brill Building medley that was not included on the CD release.  For some reason, I got it in my head that a film with footage of King and Gerry Goffin in their halycon songwriting days would be superimposed over the vocals.  It wasn't, and I was disappointed I had the wrong idea about the video.  Also, King's version of her excellent song \"One Fine Day,\" as represented here, is a brief, one-verse take, over before you know it.Minor quibbles in an otherwise brilliant concert.  King was at the peak of her form here, and it shows."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was shocked to see Tchaikovsky's classic danced exclusively by males.  One reviewer felt that the result was a \"human\"-- not merely  \"romantic\"-- ballet.  I saw it as a travesty of Swan Lake.  We all know that gays have contributed much to ballet, but Nureyev danced with Fonteyn in the pas de deux from Le Corsaire.  A gay agenda should not trump artistic integrity.  The superb pas de deux by Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky in the other selection from Swan Lake did not remove the bad taste left by Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Puccini's La Fanciulla Del West must have a great cast, in order to bring out the depth of characterizations and musical values, as prescribed by Puccini and his librettist. Placido Domingo and Carol Neblett shine in this production from the Royal Opera. The rest of the cast are all well- suited to their roles. Maestro Santi has a reputation for being a formidable Italian conductor! The production is great. I'm spoiled by today's High-Definition format, so my only reservation is the picture quality. This production is from a number of years ago. All in all,this is a good product and should be in any operaficionado's collection!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Fanciulla should be lively....rugged men, perky young gal.... but Neblett acts like a 40 year old school marm and is not helped by the ponderously slow tempi.  This ain't Wagner!!  Phrases that should bounce and sparkle are more like dirges.  Domingo is ordinary as usual, but sings a bit better here than in the Met production.  I usually like Carolli, but not so much here.......rather stiff and one dimensional.So why did I give 4 stars.........the sets and costumes are fantastic.  Altho Minnie's cabin has elaborate china and stuff you would never expect in a wilderness cabin."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Notes accompanying the McCreesh/Gabrieli Consort CD of Theodora point to indications that Handel considered this oratorio his finest work in opera or oratorio. That is certainly my experience with it, and this DVD of this Sellars/Christie operatic staging of the oratorio is my favorite presentation of it, one I go back to again and again. As one would expect with Christie, the orchestration is all one could ask for and is matched by the quality of the singing. Sellars' modernist, minimalist staging works seamlessly to enhance the drama of the storyline. And to my surprise, the Sellars USAF/contemporary dress costuming works exceptionally well (except for the scenes where over-the-top pressure control gear is added to the USAF flight suits for the Roman troops--I can only think that the extra gear came as a package deal with the flight suits and Sellars couldn't bear not using it).To fully appreciate the all round quality of this production, just compare it with the DVD for the Bejun Mehta interpretation of Theodora."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Handel's late oratorio is giving a magnificent reading in this modern staging, taped at the 1996 Glyndebourne Festival.  Baroque specialist William Christie leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and a group of spectacularly talented principals who bring great sensitivity and drama to some of Handel's most achingly-beautiful music.  Daniels, Upshaw, Croft and Hunt all sing ravishingly (pay special attention to Croft's wonderful first act aria).  The Glyndebourne Chorus is spectacular, and gives wonderful treatment to the great choral sections.  Avante-garde director Peter Sellars gives the piece a modern treatment that holds interest, if not providing any revelatory moments.  Technical aspects are superb.  Highly recommended for the Handel completist, and a great introduction to this beautiful score (considered to be Handel's personal favorite)."}

I really enjoyed the second act in the Dr's \"workroom\".  The members of the company who \"dance\" the various \"dolls\" are great especially the one who performs the floppy, unformed, unsculpted \"doll\".  Also worth noting is that a friend who knows nothing about ballet easily understood the story without help from me or any other source."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "I've just now (minutes ago) finished seeing this film for the first time.I'm awestruck.Had this film been made by anyone other than Fritz Lang I'd have thought it impossible in the context of a film circa 1931.  Peter Lorre's performance as a child murderer is incredible.  His pleas for mercy when being \"tried\" by the underworld bosses is amazing.  The director spends an entire film making you hate his character and in a matter of seconds, Peter Lorre makes you understand the pathos, the compulsion, the madness that drives him to do what he does.  He relates real pain, real self hatred and true madness.  The cinematography is PERFECT.  Every aspect is flawless.  All this from a film made nearly three quarters of a century ago.It's in German.  Subtitles.  Big deal.  If you're even looking at this, you need to see it, period."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "German director Fritz Lang's first sound film was this haunting story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre) on the loose in a large German city.  It is a seminal film in the sense that it ranks among the first appearances of two genres: police procedurals and serial killer movies.  Lang's Berlin is an eerie place full of shadows and inhabited by a very well-organized underworld that is capable of launching its own manhunt for the killer when the police investigation makes things too uncomfortable.  Lorre's Hans Beckert is a pathetic figure that acts on his grotesque compulsions in total ignorance of the forces aligning against him.  His tormented speech toward the end of the film, when he has been put on trial before the mass of the Berlin underworld, shows keen insight into the killer's condition and mental state, almost eliciting sympathy for him.  This is a stark, facinating film."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Amazing how the old school films had no need for all the gore and over-explicit graphics often used in modern filmography. This film offers a look at a very true and realistic problem that seems to have been haunting societies since old. It makes one see that fine line between true sickness of the mind and and a plain criminal one. This must have been a very controversial film for its time but it brings something that has to be dealt with. Again, is amazing how no over explicit graphics are needed in order to awake one's imagination. Not that I don't like graphics, is just that sometimes the imagination does a better job at imaging and bringing true tension to the scenes. Very well made film and classic for all times. Superb role for Peter Lorre. A better actor for this charachter could have never been found."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Fritz Lang's first sound film is a masterpiece of dread and suspense. Hans appears almost like the children he victimizes, soft and weak, and his fear of exposure almost makes us pity him. You can't conceive of anyone but Lorre pulling off this tricky characterization.  Lang creates a Berlin whose layout seems designed to expose the molester, a city of shadows, blind alleys, and a million unseen, unsparing eyes. Seventy five years after its release, this film retains its shock value. Along with \"Metropolis\", an early pinnacle for director Lang."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If he did it could have been Fritz Lang & his seminal talkie, M, made in 1931 & released in 1933. A deranged child murderer is loose in the city (played broadly & wonderfully by \"newcomer,\" Peter Lorre).The movie has scenes pitting citizen v. citizen, in accusations & counter accusations, near lynchings & mob hysteria. The police seem helpless & bereft of clues. Organized crimes seeks to find the murderer also. He's bad for business.Crowd mentality is examined. It is a theme Lang returns to in later movies. His first American movie, Fury , (1936) deals with vigilantism & mob rule. This version, a poor print by the way, has English subtitles so you're forced to pay attention. It was Lang's favorite film. It is a prototype, if you will, of the murder mystery genre. Kind of a precursor to Hitchcock's thrillers of the 40's & 50's."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Ok... in my book, you can't miss any film that has the great Peter Lorre in a key role. While this film was most likely intended to make a statement about society, it translates nicely as a finely crafted story of a manhunt for a despicable murderer of children.The Criterion dvd features a very nice print, and considering this is in the early day of sound film, maintains a clean soundtrack.Like the best of post WWI German films, M makes people look at themselves and question the power that leads, or misleads. The gray area is surprisingly broad when presented in such a skilled way. This film merits re-watching as the arguement proposed in M leaves further questions, rather than answers.The sharp editing and stark imagery make the technical execution of this film a classic and paints society itself as ugly as its own nightmares."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is without hyperbole one of the best movies ever made.  When I first watched it, I was absolutely riveted.  While German cinema of this time period (1920s-1930s) was certainly edgy, experimental and deeply rooted in the social issues of the day, this movie stands above the rest.  It's one of the very first movies to examine the social problems of serial killers, pedophiles, mental illness and mob rule.  And all of this is delivered with Fritz Lang's incomparable film-making style.The newest Criterion release is definitely the best available.  Not only does the film look lovely with its new transfer, but there are plenty of informative extras to keep Lang's most ardent fans happy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I watched this over and over with my son when he was little. Now I have a little granddaughter and she loves it too. This is a very fun movie. Karate kicking, pizza eating turtle boys are probably not the best influence but they are sweet (even Raf in his way) and well intentioned with a strong sense of right and wrong. Shredder is scary and bad but try to find a movie without an antagonist. And at the end of the day parents are a far bigger influence than any movie is ever gonna be."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was a big fan of the cartoon series, which my parents disliked with a passion, but I persuaded them to take me to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie at the theater back in 1990 (Writing this makes me feel old! lol!). Surprisingly, my parents liked the movie and its two sequels.The 1990 movie is the closest that resembles the comics, except for the part of April being a reporter. The costumes done by the Jim Henson Company are better looking than most CGI special effects that are used in most movies today. This was my first true introduction of Casey Jones, who was hardly used in the animated series (I'm not counting the 2003 series). The only thing I disliked was Shredder's costume as it looked to fake. The producers should have gave the designers a little bit more money for it.Overall, it is still one of my favorite movies from my childhood."}

While this movie wasn't great as far as technical standards it still did a great job capturing the story line and personalities.  I thought maybe I had outgrown the turtles but as soon as I saw the movie again I was hooked.  I couldn't wait to find an original Nintendo and start playing the TMNT game again.  You've got to own this part of independent film history."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "Parece que la extraviada (Traviata)realmente esta muy enferma al final ya que la escena esta incompleta. esto no deberia asombrarnos ya que Zeffirelli hizo algo peor con su Otello con su recortada aria del Sauce. Excepto este detalle no tan importante como el Otello, la pelicula es muy bella aunque para los puristas, entre los que me incluyo humildemente quizas por mi condicion de Profesor de Apreciacion Musical, encuentro en ella tal como note en la Carmen de Migenes y Domingo, ruidos innecesarios que en la presentacion en un teatro serian imperdonables; al fin y al cabo lo importante es la musica y no los extras caprichosos de Zeffirelli. A pesar de estos pequenos detalles la presentacion es maravillosa; las cuatro estrelas en vez de cinco obedecen a estas para algunos quizas necedades. Para mi repito, soy un purista y pienso en la intencion siempre del compositor. Recomiendo la version de Beverly Sills y ni se diga la de Angela Ghiorgiu, superiores excepto los tenores ya que Placido Domingo sigue siendo el mejor."}

Franco Zeffirelli did a fantastic job with this  opera-movie.  Visually, it is heaven for the eyes.  As for the acting, it  is a bit rough around the edges, but the beauty of the music makes up for  it.  Teresa Stratas' portrayal of Violetta is not the best I have heard.  Placido was amazing as usual.  The rest of the cast is good and the scene  with the gypsies and bullfighters was absolutely stunning.  This is a  must-see for opera fans and even people who don't care for opera would  enjoy it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As I understand it, this film was a revolution at the time, with Zeferelli opting for shooting as for a film rather than filming a stage production. As another commentator commented, the miming is not always perfect and lip movements and sung words don't always match. However, the sound of one of Verdi's greatest operas is wonderful and the soloists are great. Domingo is in his prime here, not only a splendid voice but also a great actor, and Teresa Stratas does an equally great job as Violetta. The production is gorgeous, a feast to the eye as well as the ear, and the party scene, with two stars of the Bolshoi Ballet in the starring dancing roles, is absolutely breathtaking (\"He really didn't do that, did he? Omigosh, he did it again!\"). A must for all lovers of opera."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This adaptation of Verdi's opera La Traviata is simply sumptuous and a lavish production. Never before than an opera is transformed into a beautiful film. Ms.Stratas and Mr. Domingo performed and sings with pure gusto and it is a sheer delight. Set designs and costumes are a credit to the production and director Zeffereli excels in his delivery of this opera and presents it as a movie experience. Music performed by The Metropolitan Opera orchestra conducted by James Levine and the music thoroughly shines all the way through.I truly enjoyed this film experience and enjoy the music and performance."}

Sure, safe acts, crooners and Vegas swingers ruled on the show - particularly as hosts - but it all works as a beautiful period piece. Rock and roll was only a decade old when these shows were filmed, and TV execs were fighting a losing battle to co-opt it. The purity of performances by the Animals, the Yardbitds and the Byrds show how uncontrollable the energy was. Anyone who grew up in the era will love this.

The animators have truely captured the movement of each different type of animal that inspired the film. This is Disney at it's very best!Besides the wonderful animation, my children and I enjoy the humor. I love the owl talking to the older Bambi, Thumper, and Flower about all the animals being \"twitterpated\" in the Springtime; they all vow that it will never happen to them, but sure enough, one by one, they all fall victim to it.The flawless animation, the colorful imagery, cute, memorable characters, humor. Bambi is a true gem; a timeless treasure. A priceless Masterpiece."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I didn't see Bambi in the theaters until I was in college and I remember being blown away by the animation in it.  This restoration has renewed my admiration for the animators who worked on this film.  The animation looks almost 3-D in it's use of the multiplane camera technique.  The colors are brilliant and the soundtrack is even more glorious than I remembered.  Yes, there are a few slow parts to the film, but scene of Bambi on the ice is hilarious and the excitement of the forest fire and Bambi and his father's escape from it will keep you riveted to the screen. One very curious thing I noticed in the extras disc, the film was originally marketed as a love story. Anyway, the extras keep you interested in the techniques used to draw the film and how it was restored.  A must have for any family, or kid at heart like me."}

When I was a little girl Bambi maded me cry especaily the scene where the mother had died in the foster ! That mother dieing by a hunter in the forrest maded me feel very emotional as little girl in the mid80's ! When I saw this with My mother and a friend as a little girl of Disney 's Bambi in the mid80's ! This was my first emotional scene as a little girl watching Bambi in the mid 80's !First time I felt for a carttoon in a flim as a little girl but still a great classic of one disney greatest animation with emotion !"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "BAMBI is one of my favorite animated films produced from Walt Disney's creative genius. However, this DVD presentation of BAMBI somehow does not look true to Walt's original vision. The colors look over-enhanced and seem to alter the intention of the original filmmakers. My VHS and Laserdisc copies look much better than this DVD. You can see the original brush strokes if you look hard enough at those copies. Digital restoration seems to be getting to the point where restoration is now becoming recreation. There was a subdued natural look to the original BAMBI. This DVD looks too vibrant to the point where the colors seem to bleed into each other and become a distraction. Some of the innovations like the multiple plane shoots seem to lose their effectiveness. BAMBI is still an outstanding film exploring such themes as love, loss, coming of age and responsibility. These themes are artistically and dramatically represented here and they remain timeless."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The tale of BAMBI is timeless. Heartwarming and heartbreaking it endures the test of time as nature itself. I'll admit that when I was growing up I had little affection for BAMBI but some of the vivid images have remained with me up to this day.  The Great Prince all alone as the hard snow falls in a deafening silence is unnerving and almost unbearable to watch. Yet, his father is there to finish his upbringing and they walk off to his adulthood. As I return now I see the tenderness and harsh lesson we all must endure. Simply told through a brilliantly visual medium this film is so appropriately conceived for its honesty and celebration of life and nature. It has now become a favorite."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid of about seven or eight.  I didn't realize that I was just a couple of years younger at that point than my dad was when the movie was originally released in '42.The beginning shows the superior artistry in telling the story.  It comes across as real woods.  For the most part, the animals behaved like animals (though I don't think deer talk to rabbits in real life).The best part of the DVD is the story board, where they go through the movie with the creators telling their thoughts about what to do and comparing it with previous movies.One part of the movie that is fantasy is that man is the only predator.  In real life, the old wise owl and Flower would be preadators as well.  Coyotes and wolves and mountain lions and bob cats were all absent from this forest.I found this a very scary movie when I was young.  Parents would want to watch this with their kids, especially young ones."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "At first, I wasn't sure if I really wanted to purchase this movie or not.However, nowI'm really glad that I have. I think I was reluctant because when I saw it the first time as a kid I didn't really understand what the purpose of the movie was. In a way, Bambi is a bit dark for kids. I love Bambi because of the simplicity of the storyline and the beauty of themusic. The music on its own is like another character and really describes what's going on in the movie.This D.V.D. set is wonderful because it goes inside Disney's private vault and it has some excellent games for all ages alike. I even found some of the games a bit more challenging then I would have liked. This is a really good family movie. However, I would suggest that children be a bit older to watchso that they completely understand what is happening in the movie."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It's nice to see that some of the Disney classics get treated with the respect they deserve. After Dumbo got passed over, I wasn't sure it they would do any more deluxe 2 disc sets for these national treasures. 'Bambi' is the studios 5 full length animated feature film and is a testament to the animation, storytelling and loving care that when into these amazing features. Though 'Bambi' is not one of my personal favorites it is a beautiful film. The restoration is fantastic and the film looks better than ever!  The second disc is full of interesting extras, too many for me to go through in one sitting. I didn't see any trailers, but I would hope they are on this deluxe set."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Bambi isn't just one of Disney's best animated features, it truly is a work of stunning art.  Really.  The entire film is so gorgeously imagined, choreographed and executed that it may move you in its sheer beauty, not to mention the fact that it is a wonderfully layered story appropriate for nearly anyone anywhere.  It is fascinating to watch it as the precursor to nearly all of Disney's later triumphs, perhaps most of all The Lion King.  It is essentially the same story, told through a different species.  Even the settings, and the dramatic use of nature as integral to the scenic look of the film, recall so many other, later Disney films.  Your children will love it, and yes, they'll be devastated by its most heart-wrenching plot twist.  But it's also a wonderful way to introduce bits of life's crueler twists of fate -- and to discuss them as a family.  Bravo Bambi!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Bambi is one of the greatest Disney features of our time. Every scene in this movie just fits perfectly together, including everyone's favorite scenes: the ice skating, the \"bird\", and of course, the death of Bambi's mother. I don't usually cry when I see this scene, but it touches me having lost my father at a point in my life. Bambi is obviously a cute cartoon character, and probably the cutest of the early generation of Disney films, next to Thumper. The story is influential, and even controversial. It's all amazing!Rating: 5 stars/5 stars"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this movie and had my three plus yr old watch it and I couldn't believe how terrified he was. I had to keep forwarding the scary scenes. I had no idea this was such an old movie. The music sounds like church music and is not something I consider for kids (Remember it is rated G). The video may be remastered but the audio quality is poor and one has to turn up the volume to listen to the dialogue which makes the scary scenes even more so. I think this is an age old format of story telling which needs to revised. Unfortunately Disney keeps repeating it through movies like Incredibles."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the film we all will someday show our kids and hopefully inculcate many morals to live by:  \"Now, children, remember, life isn't always fair. Don't start forest fires, and tell all your hunter friends that Bambi misses his mommy.\"I liked the film. I really did. My mother...well, she's a mother, so she understands the \"sacrifices\" (I've never seen anyone so passionately cry for Dumbo's mother, either).It's a Disney classic, so if you plan to have kids someday, and you want to get the above messages across, this movie pretty much does the trick."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Aaaahhhhhh, yes that's the perfect mock for a movie so touchy.This movie is no way cheesy or corny.  Bambi was a movie that taught kids that life was not a piece of cake.  In fact you have to deal with reality, like the most fearful thing for a kid be left alone, and the death of a loved one.  How cruel that sound, but Disney as always painted the movie wich such matices that the carry on of it is such painfully delightful.  Without a doubt Bambi will always be one of the most powerful and defying animated pictures.  Bambi focus as many here have stated the relationship that human have(in an animal way).  A nice movie to cherish adn remember."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The very best Peter Pan ever made for film. I am sure we are not the only family that loves this movie together as a family. We have to watch it every year at Christmas , 4 generations gather around the TV sometime during December to watch Peter Pan and a few other family favorite movies. We just love the animation and the way in which the story is told, it makes you wish Neverland was real and we could all be kids and play forever. We love watching our gandsons pretending to be Peter and fighting Hook. A huge bowl of homemade caramel corn, and beverage of your choice have been found by our family to only enhance the viewing pleasure!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "You can fly You can fly, you can fly!!!! Where the imagination can take you into far away lands you'll never forget TinkerBell! Don't we all love her! I'm troubled by the depiction of native americans though. What makes the red man red? I think this is the only set back to the film there's some prejudice there that I'm not happy with. Don't we all wanna stay as children? We all miss our childhoods. This film is by far one of the best films to relive your childhood."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is one of my favorite movies from my youth. The story follows the book reasonable close. What child won't want to have this adventure - pirates, Indians - being able to fly - this movie has it all!The picture is VERY good - probably as good, if not better, than when it was first shown in the theaters. I've owned this on tape, DVD and now blu-ray.The night scenes over London remind me of the ride in Disney World - quite simply they are beautiful.Some of the songs, notably 'You Can Fly', fits the story almost like they were written when the book was!This is a movie for the ages. Certainly this is a movie all childern (and those young at heart) should see several times in their life. The lessions it has are timeless as well.The movie came quickly and in perfect shape - all at a unbeatable price.I would rate this a very strong 9.0 to 9.25 out of 10."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Disney Studios 14th full length animated feature film is another fan favorite. Peter Pan is another enduring classic released at the height of the studios resurgence. The last film of the heavily influenced Mary Blair years. The colors pop even more on this sparkling Blu Ray treatment and there are some excellent bonus features on this set. Considering this is the 4th release on home video in fairly recent years there was no reason to lose any bonus features in the place of others here. The film is presented in its original theatrical fomat (full screen).Still the film has never looked or sounded better and there are some quality bonus features on this set. Overall this is a very satisfying release. The story is simple, the characters (Tinker Bell is a standout!)and songs are memorable. It's no wonder this is a fan favorite and had stood the test of time.If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "All I can say is WOW!!I hadnt watched Peter Pan in about 15 years, but it somehow remained one of my favourites. I got the Special Edition DVD last night and immediatly ripped the Amazon box and the wrapping..... I watched the movie....and suddenly I remembered I could fly.This is a fantastic story, where as a child you can relate, and certainly wish Peter will lose his shadow in your bedroom.This version has also some very interesting features, like language tracks in French and Spanish (its really funny to hear the characters in another language), commentaries, games and more!And... after watching it again, and again, and again.... it still remains as one of my favourites!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I own the special edition, but Im glad that they are finally releasing this great movie for all those who missed it when it was available last time. This version is probably the best ever released and the price is pretty reasonable. The special edition was only 1 disk and cost a bit more.Hopefully Pinnochio will be coming soon to Platinum. I have the limited edition and it's a pretty bad transfer (looks like straight from VHS with no clean up). However, Im holding on to it incase they censor the platinum version.I think this re-release of PeterPan is a signal that Disney is seeing the light. They are losing alot of revenue to chinese bootlegs being sold on [...], and god knows [...] doesnt give a crap about enforcement."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a great movie.  It's funny, well written and tells a wonderful story.  However, I'm sick of this steryotype crap. Give me a break people, this movie was made a long time ago, when they made movies with a decent story line, and didn't compromise that to make all the poor little people happy.  Looses up. Don't talk to your kids about it being &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;  what next burn it 'cos it's offensive? Give me a break. Let peoople make movies properly, and don't worry about offending everyone in the world.  Most people aren't offended and out dumber those that for whatever reason are. Get a life."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This digitally restored Platinum Edition of the Disney classic breathes new life into the movie, putting it in front of a new generation of viewers with more vibrant colors that stand out and surround sound that will make you jump off your couch.As for the story, it really never gets old. Like Dumbo, Pinnochio or Bambi, one can watch it over and over and feel like the first day, when you dreamed alongside the gang, that you could fly to Neverland.The extras contained definitely make for an interesting complement, with the segment with Disney himself topping the list. As a package, if you don't already own the movie, it's highly recommendable, and if you do, it may not be a bad idea to sell your used movie and get your hands on this great collector's item."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When someone asks &quot;what is your favorite Disney movie&quot; I usually reply, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; or &quot;The Lion King&quot;, as do most people. There is one Disney movie, which almost everyone loves, yet always seems to forget, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. This is one of Disney's most wonderfully brilliant and magical movies ever. It combines the joy of childhood with the seriousness of growing up. I remember watching it so often that I wore out my video. Anyone of any age can enjoy this film...and will."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "\"SHANGHAI WENDY?\", the pirates reply.!!!  That's what I say!!!Captain Hook is, his fellow pirates say, \"the world's most famous crook\"!If it weren't for Peter Pan, I would not have a name!  I'm most grateful to be named after Wendy Darling, a most gracious heroine and foster mother to the Lost Boys of Never, Never Land.  I'm so glad too that Disney left out the ending where Wendy grows up after all, gets married, and meets Peter Pan after so many years of separation.  What a rotten ending, I've always thought, so glad this version ended differently.There's not really a moral to the story, just a fanciful adventure/children's story of innocent kids battling Captain Hook and his cohorts.  Another Disney classic!\"Say your prayers, Hook!!!\", Peter Pan replies when he saves the day!"}

{"label": 6, "raw": "It's great to see this concert film again. The split-screen effect still holds up, even if it's a bit distracting to the enjoyment of the musical performances. Richie Havens and The Who still stand out as incredible sequences in the film. I'm not such a fan of mud, but these people actually make mud dancing look like fun. There's an incredible story about why the Woodstock festival actually took place in Bethel. A guy named Elliot Tiber issued a concert permit to the Woodstock organizers from the Bethel Chamber of Commerce, where he was a member. The rest, as they say, is history. The Elliot Tiber story is told very well in a forthcoming book called TAKING WOODSTOCK. Keep an eye out for it on Amazon; it should fast become the perfect preamble to watching this movie. Have fun, everyone, and remember -- DON'T EAT THE BROWN ACID!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "After reading the book by Michael Lang, the man who thought this whole festival up..(\" the road to Woodstock\"), it put it all in perspective for me!

I still can't get Richie Havens Out of my head And that's a beautiful thing! Nor Santana for that matter!! They laid the groundwork for the vibe that was the Woodstock Festival. 10 stars!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Honest to God being of the Woodstock generation I had Great expectations from this release, and was very disappointing with the resolution and the editing of this version. I was really looking for something that looked like at least somewhat close to the original theatrical release but this fell very short. The Audio is barely OK and sounds flat (dynamics are lacking in the music)and the added footage does not add much to the film.In addition I would be hard pressed to say it's a Hi Def film. The contrast in many parts is just poor, and no it's not my set. I have a newer set that was rated pretty high, and I have never had this issue in concert films. I guess I would say except on vintage poorly non Hi Def films that were poorly transferred. Over all I can not see anything about this making it look or sound like a newly Remastered Version Hi Def  release, Nothing!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Yes, I have the VCR and a DVD recorded from the Cinemax airing, and the cassettes,but I'm happy I got the remastered anniversary edition. I used it during aWoodstock 40th anniversary promotion in my small shop and celebrated by not takinga shower all weekend. As a result it played continuously for 3 days. On the fourth day,I took it home and watched it again that evening. To watch it that much is a testamentto the significance of the event.Or....I'm a moron. OK, your point is well taken. But, it's still an excellent product.The packaging was fun too. The best $483 I've ever spent.What? Amazon has it for how much.............? Crap."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "I really loved this version.  I had watched the film on cable,  but it never filled the HD screen.  I have no idea, but I decided to purchase the 40th Anniversary which is also the Director's Cut.  The film deserved it's Oscar.  It is a Time Capsule of a time and a place that has never been reproduced (but they did try).The ratio is not full HD, but the screen is much larger, performers get longer sets, more music.  For anyone curious or to see what this was all about, you cannot go wrong with this set."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a great movie.  I've seen it a ton of times.  And it was amazing how many people showed up to this invent.  I am a big fan of Jimi Hendrix and I loved his version of the Star Spangled Banner.  I liked the Who's performance.  And Richie Havens singing Freedom.  Also Sly and the Family Stone singing I Wanna Take You Higher and Sly doing a little dance.  And Country Joe and the Fish singing that song about the war.  The whole movie is great.  Anybody that hasn't seen it should see it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was 20 years old in '69, didn't make it to Woodstock, even though I only lived 200 miles away in Vt. On this 40th anniversary, I am kicking myself repeatedly! I just bought the 40th anniversary directors cut boxed set and love every moment of it. But for me, I keep going back to those precious few moments where the three nuns are walking through the crowd. The wonderful smile and the spontaneous peace sign -FROZEN IN TIME- it just cuts to my soul! I can't help but wonder what ever became of that young lady in the blue habit. I have a feeling she lived a very PEACEFUL life.God, I wish I'd been there!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "While I like the multichannnel remix overall I'd say if you already have the Directors cut DVD then I wouldn't spend the money on the Blu-Ray.  The picture on the DVD looks the same on the Blu-Ray which makes sense since I would guess that the original footage was shot in 16mm.  The audio on the other hand sounds much better than on the DVD. If you're an audio purist than you probably won't like the multichannel mix, but I'm not a purist so I enjoyed it.  If you haven't seen the Director's cut then definiately buy the Blu-Ray.  The extra footage is worth the price."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A great introduction for those who missed out (like I did), but not so much a documentary or a concert. I supposed it is very difficult to fit 3 days into the time alloted, but it's oftentimes very difficult to watch as  some songs are cut short... the cameramen can't find the subject they're  shooting... the filmmakers often focus on mundane topics rather than  grabbing the full excitement of the event. Don't get me wrong - it's a  great piece of history - it just doesn't seem to capture the best of it,  IMHO."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Woodstock was the high point of the late sixties.  It was a time of innocence and pain.  It was a time when we who were young were members of a tribe - we cared for each other and shared visions of a better world.  Yes, there were problems - bad drugs, lack of sanitation, and the like.  But it worked in its time.  The movie captures this mood so well, both in the interviews and in the music.  The multiple frames help to show the different aspects of life at Woodstock so well.  I'm not sure if those who are younger now can truly understand why Woodstock was so important - maybe this film will help them to understand."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The myth is so powerful about Woodstock that I was struck by the difference between memory and reality.  Woodstock is mythic as being a music concert, of which music the \"Woodstock\" film is ostensibly a record.  And that is how I remembered it: as near-non-stop music.The concert was 24/7 for three days and nights.  That's a huge amount of music.  Turns out that most of this film is about the event -- there is actually very little music in it.  The end credits name only such as Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Canned Heat, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, and perhaps Santana.  And that is accurate: there really is very little music in it; most of the film is visuals of the event, and interviews with some there, and others reactions to it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The actual event of Woodstock goes beyond simple concert and music footage. The work of capturing history on film must have been daunting. Not only was history captured on film, it was filmed as documentary, too. When it's mentioned that this film won an Oscar as best documentary, \"of course\" is the only comment that comes to mind.The extended version or director's cut is worth the time. When I got this film, I called my neighbors and had a Woodstock evening with food, drink, and, well whatever. It was wonderful to be that young, again, and listen to some of our musical heroes.This should be required viewing for every generation in the foreseeable future. Enjoy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I love Woodstock.  I must have seen the movie as a midnight show several times in the 1970's.  I bought this edition because of the promised unreleased footage, including CCR.  It is NOWHERE to be found on the two disc edition I received.  Apparently, there is a third disc containing this in some special editions, but NOT the one I got.  I am still glad I bought it, but cannot recommend it to others for this reason unless you know what you are getting."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was a really terrific film.  I wish they could've made a series of films like this to capture the entire festival, but this comes as close as we've got I guess.  As it was, I felt transported and when it was over, I was sad to leave it.  Really glad I got the director's cut!  This is a great historical document that captures not only the music (though I wish there were more), but the climate (political and natural) surrounding the festival as well.  Whether you were there or wish you could have been, this is a great trip!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Without question this was a landmark movie. Some of the greatest acts in rock and roll were able to perform in this movie. The movie going fan was able to see the Who,Joe Cocker,Janis Joplin,Jimi Hendrix,Sly and the Family Stone, Richie Havens, John Sebastian and the Loving Spoonful as well as many other up and coming stars in the world of music. The music in the movie was very good. The on the scene footage was also well shot. You were able to see Woodstock from every perspectivein this movie. That this video is till available 32 years lateris a testament to this event. Buy this and watch it. It is a collector's item."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this product for the additional performances not included in the regular director's cut.  It was good to see the performances of CCR and a few others not previously seen.  It made me appreciate the camera work and editing done on the actual movie performances, because the bonus footage was just standard footage and not nearly as interesting from a visual perspective.  I wanted to see the footage of the Grateful Dead and then understood why I hadn't seen it before.  It was a lackluster performance and the lighting was terrible, because the festival producers were not catering to the needs of the film crew.  Based on the extra footage provided I thought the set was way overpriced.  They tried to justify the high cost by including a lot of unnecessary packaging and nicknacks that didn't add much real value.  They even included a little Woodstock tambourine, which is not something I would have paid for.  I would say just buy the director's cut.  Most of the additional performances are available on Youtube."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was thinking of buying this item, but after reading the reviews, and finding out just what is NOT included in it, I said SKIP it!! All the other bands that did not make it to the previous versions are NOT on here. I guess in order to see them you have to have a BLU-RAY player, which I don`t have, and in these tight times, do not plan to get.(In my opinion BLU-RAY is a waste of money, once you get used to it, you would`nt want to go back to standard, so your hooked on it and its higher prices). This is a NOT SO SPECIAL EDITION. How many years will it take before the regular people can have the full version. Maybe I`ll get the 50th anniversary version!

If you like music from that era, this film is a definite must have. The who, Hendrix, Joe Cocker to name a few, but many other as well. Interesting look into Flower power.

{"label": 6, "raw": "This movie is a classic and is done by Rankin and Bass, the same people who gave you &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;This movie was made a year after i was born, and didn't see it until I was about sixteen i think (memory is the first thing to go, you know)  I first watched it when it was on the Disney Channel (I'm not kidding here)  and I taped it.  I still have the tape, but not the Disney Channel.James Earl Jones makes an execellent bad guy named Omodon.  This movie also stars John Ritter from the &quot;Problem Child&quot; movies.If you liked The Hobbit or The Last Unicorn, you'll love this!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the best movie! I love it, and I just finished watching it. It's exactly like the movie I watched on TV as a kid. It's not edited or anything. The front picture is misleading, if you look at the back of the DVD it's more true to form. It's a great inspiration to me, I couldn't be happier with the film. I bought one for twenty four dollars and it was hard to find. This is more organized, and classically done. I wish I had this one instead, but I bought this because my family loves this film. Espcially my brother, and now we both have one this is the best."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is deep, serious fantasy stuff, not messing around or tarnishing the image of the dragon. It has a strong story, fantastic villains, and even a deep philosophy behind the story. Plus, it doesn't get graphic with the  violence, so the whole family can watch it. It also has a fantastic theme  song. You just have to hear it! It will make you cry, and you will be  singing it for days. As much as I enjoyed Willow, I believe that this is  the perfect fantasy movie. Forget Dragonheart, and what I've read about  Dragonslayer makes it sound unsuitable for kids. If you're touchy about  things like drunken behavior, then keep the really young kids away.  Otherwise, enjoy this fantastic movie. Watch for Sir Orin Neville-Smythe's  prayer. It has to be one of the best monologues in any movie ever. If you  like this movie, I also recommend The Last Unicorn."}

Ann Margaret is very complimentary to Elvis as his wannabe love interest.  The songs in his films were often poor quality, but not so much in this film.If you are a new Elvis fan and want to see a high quality Technicolor transfer of a great classic romp....this is my pick for his best movie.

However the DVD was released in Standard format only (full screen) which is way lame.And Hitchcock performed many other songs that were filmed that could've easily been included here. the Soundtrack CD contains a bunch of songs not in the film (and the Soundtrack Vinyl LP contains a few more).It's nice that Demme would make this film but why is it SOOO brief?I mean his Talking Heads film Stop Making Sense is nearly two hours in length.Come on, 77 Minutes?!?It's shame that it took so long to be released on DVD/VHS to begin with but why itwas given such a half baked-release is beyond me.Hitchcock deserves much better."}

The visual effect is sedative and seductive with the psychedelic pop storyteller singing the deep psyche of your average bi-polar joe, as he warms the audience with his mesmerizing pop numbers while intriguing New York passerbys with the theatrically mysterious storefront. And he's no slouch on guitar either."}

SOme of the suggestions are simply amazing, making specific sounds gently into the baby's ears and seeing an instant, peaceful transformation.Many of these suggestions come from looking at life from the baby's perspective and, in retrospect, seem like common sense (but not as easy as it sounds, otherwise there'd be no need for this video).

{"label": 6, "raw": "Some might say (including historians, musical producers and liner notes writers) that Hawkins was much better than Webster, that only Young could equall his power with his unique approach. Even if this is true, the level at which Hawk and Webster play is so high that I see the meeting of two true giants.Impecable rhythm section led by great Oscar Peterson always helps at these Verve style encounters and I feel that both tenor plays made the best of it. Whether it is gentle ballads, blowing the blues or harmonizing in rhythm, this CD should satisfy not only swing and mainstream fans but also modern jazz fans: mainstream by definition leans somewhat towards modern jazz and Hawk and Peterson particularly well blend the best of both worlds (as they did throught their careers; Hawkins even before modern jazz was born).A classic."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Recorded in 1957 this session captures Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster duelling on Tenor Saxophones. The standard is set on the opening track ' Blues for Yolande'. This is a steady driving blues. Hawkins takes the first solo and after two choruses lets rip on the 3rd chorus with as raucous a blues riff as you're ever likely to hear on a Tenor Saxophone.Whether 'Blues for Yolande' was the first recorded track I don't know, but it wouldn't surprise me if that was Coleman Hawkins putting down a marker. Of course later on Ben Webster gets a chance to shine with some of his brilliant breathy ballad playing.The rhythm section is Alvin Stoller on drums, Ray Brown on Bass, Herb Ellis on Guitar and Oscar Peterson on Piano. As the previous reviewer said these guys are as good as it gets.A marvellous album that grows on you with repeated listens."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It is not 100% guaranteed, but the recording is relaxing enough to make sleep a real possibility. Be warned: The Delta Sleep System is NOT designed for a room-sized music system; in fact it can be downright irritating coming through big speakers. It works best with a headset on personal players like ipods and mp3 players. (Yes, you can fall asleep wearing headphones - if you use the in-the-ear buds instead of the monster head sets.) My biggest gripe is that the recording has an abrupt break in the middle - like the company is still making vinyls with only 30 minutes per side, not cds. Wish they'd made it a single, seamless recording. If I'm not fully in the zone, that break is especially annoying."}

However, that was a very good decision to say farewell to all her fans in this glorious and very seldom performed opera.She still had a very good stage presence and did not have to \"die or go mad \" at the end.The final farewell scene was impressive, I don't think any opera singer ever had such a sumptious farewell occasion. It showed how her fans loved her and would missed her.That was in sharp contrast to how Pavarotti bid farewell to her fans in New York.Both occsions would be well talked about and remembered.I wished they have taped the OONY concert performance of the same opera at Carnegie Hall last year.That was a memorable performance."}

Let's just admit that we don't have singers anymore who can perform &quot;The Night of the Seven Stars.&quot; If you want to see this opera, this is it. Okay?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The historical significance of this video is when Jimi arrived at Monterey  he was an unknown and before the concert Black artists in Rock music besides Arthur Lee of Love were big at that time in the &quot;Soul&quot; catagory only.  Hendrix understandably  nervous came thru big time and broke all stereotypes.  Monterey is clearly his best concert video for entertainment purposes with Jimi playing behind his head, the burning antics at the end, his funny comments between songs and the audience reaction to seeing him for the first time.  Also included in this film is some good background information on the Monterey Pop Festival by John Phillips.  If you're looking though for straight guitar playing, Jimi is better at &quot;Berkeley&quot;."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This film is the kind of film that best documents Jimi during the 60s era, along with him at Woodstock. Rare footage of Jimi at the Picadilly Circus in England gives this film, to me, great value. The introductionof the  show, started by Bill Grahmn, introducing Brian Jones, introducing the Jimi  Hendrix Experience-is unpresented. The entire set was filmed at good  angles, instead of just closeups and jerky movements. Even Jimi's stage  comments were filmed, completely. Even when &quot;Wild Thing&quot; was  played, different angles, in comparison to &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; were  viewed. You just have to buy and see this film, to see and hear those  details and highlights. Like I said, highly unpresedented. A definite  collector's item as well."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was not impressed when this started: the sound is rubbish, the video quality not much better, and poor old Alice is almost falling-down drunk. Things do improve tho, and when we get to the final series of songs - Black Widow, Steven, and the incendiary School's Out, ALice is bringing the house down. I was converted. I've always loved Welcome To My Nightmare, and was stoked to see Tony Levin playing on this - although interestingly uncredited.As several others have said, for all its faults this is history in the making and it deserves its place in the rock pantheon."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the best Darin DVD available - Bobby died several months after this performance.  This incredible DVD showcases better than any - and better than many of his CDs- the range of talent this man embodied.  From \"Beyond the Sea\" to \"Midnight Special,\" you get 200 percent of everything Bobby had to give. His energy in this performance is incredible, almost as if he knew it was his final. What's more, this performance had not been thoroughly rehearsed, Bobby had his oxygen sitting backstage to take hits from between songs, and if you watch closely, you'll see him working to get blood circulating through his hands. This is Bobby Darin at his cumulative best and shows what he could do with a song that no other vocalist can do."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Quite possibly the best all-around entertainer to ever step on a stage! Bobby was head-and-shoulders above his contemporaries... and others. Darin DARED! He recorded material (Dr. Doolittle; Milord, included here and, en francais, no less!) others would not even attempt and more often than not was successful, artistically if not necessarily commercially.This 4CD package represents a great cross-section of his work.A superb talent, great material, a superb package from Rhino! Superb entertainment in store for you!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am a huge fan of Bobby Darin but this video is just terrible. Instead of hearing Darin songs I want to hear I'm forced to hear songs like \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and \"Midnight Special\" might I add these songs are performed terribly. He sings Mack the knife And Beyond The Sea but he sings them boringly (is that even a word) and lame. no enthusiasm at all. I wish they would give out a tape of him in his earlier years so it would be more entertaining."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Frankly I'm at a loss why some previous commentators have come down so harshly on this performance.  There are very few really good videos of Gilbert and Sullivan available on video and this is one of those.  The staging is imaginative, the production, acting, singing and dancing are all excellent and great fun (Maureen Forrester is wonderful as the Queen of the Faeries!)  I encourage anyone who enjoys G&S; to see this.For my money, here are the really good videos of G&S; to watch:1. Mikado (Stratford)2. Iolanthe (Stratford)3. HMS Pinafore (D'Oyly Carte) (truncated & hard to find but worth it)4. Pirates of Penzance (Australian Opera)all other videos are a mixed bag and of varying quality (avoid the Eric Idle performance of Mikado at all costs)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Well, I thought I was a fan of The Shadow radio shows from the 1930's.  I've heard a bunch, and own a bunch, and in this box set here's only two I've heard before--\"Prelude to Terror,\" about a loony who concocts exploding light bulbs and plants them in strategic buildings. [..] then there's \"Reflection of Death,\" about a mirror from Inferno itself--or is it now?  Many of these feature Bill Johnstone as the Shadow, and believe me, he may have been the best of any of the men who played that role.  Each man brought his own flair to the role. the one I like least is kid Orson Welles, who hadn't yet panicked America and made his name forever. When these shows were made, he was still riding by ambulance from show to show--no joke, he did just that.  This is money well spent."}

All the children in it look like they are having a good time and it's not just set in the tree house - a real farm with real animals is in it, a camping ground, a make-believe fairy book land and the school yard are all scenes for songs in this video.  If you like Barney songs you'll love this video.  Great value for money."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you want to sing and dance with Barney, well...this is the one for you. It's a marvelous video, and when we put the film on for our two year old twin girls, they know just about everything that's on it.  From \"Down on Grampa's Farm,\" to \"Mr. Sun,\" to \"Me and My Teddy,\" to the dancing of \"Baby Hop Bop,\" it's a wonderful adventure.  And to see Barney dance around- it's incredible to think he's so animated, but that's what the secret of this Barney character is.  Just for kids, and this video has the new and the older children who are re-united in all their glory and memories.  It's a great video, and highly recommended!!!"}

The Greatest Hits format of the concert is wonderful and the sound quality  is great!  Also note the lip synch that the stage screen and live Tina  accomplish in River Deep, Mountain High and the coreography involved in the  Goldeneye number. Great dvd, BUY IT!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Tina Turner DVD is in DTS and it sounds wonderful. The image isn't bad either, but it looks a little soft--almost like it was filmed instead of taped. The concert was recorded in Amsterdam, so maybe there were some PAL  to NTSL conversion issues. Or maybe the producers just wanted a softer  look.This is a high energy DVD. You almost get out of breath just  watching it. Most of the songs are up tempo and have lots of energy. Lights  flash, scenes change rapidly. It's very effective. I found myself squinting  from time to time when a bright light was shown on my monitor."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I will try to be as bried/concise as possible:&quot;Live in Amsterdam: Wildest Dreams Tour - DTS DVD&quot; is one of the best DVDs ever released.

It gives you a true feeling of a live concert. Just close your eyes and imagine yourself at the stadium...watchng this legendary performer act for you...just for you.I can't stop watching this concert over and over. If you are a true Tina fan or just like good quality music, YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS DVD!

{"label": 6, "raw": "I am a big Tina Turner fan who personally thinks she sounds better on record, than live.  This concert is enjoyable, but after awhile her voice is annoying because she tends to scream.  Tina has a good voice, but not great, in my opinion.  Her studio recordings have always sounded better probably because she can do them again and again until she gets them perfect. Concerts don't allow such luxuries.This DVD is available in a 5.1 surround sound version, or DTS version.  I have the 5.1 surround DVD and it is more than adequate.  I have to ask why the concert wasn't filmed in widescreen to give the viewer more of a feel for the concert.The DVD also includes a lengthy interview with Tina where she discusses each track of the then new album &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;.  The interview, while promotional based, is very enjoyable and contains video excerpts for each album track."}

Filmed before a small audience at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988 it appears that Diamond was just going through the motions.The performance, while it does include some of his best work, seems oddly disconnected and lifeless. The mix is adequate but nothing special. There are times when the camera cuts to a member of the band and you can't really hear the instrument he is playing.I have seen Mr. Diamond twice before and I know that there are better performances out there. The song selection could have been boosted to add some more of the classics.All in all you need to take what you can get but this DVD is disappointing."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This was a bit of a disappointment.  The performance was okay and pretty much what I expected but I guess I must have evolved out of liking this sort of music.  It is music; most of what comes out of the pop world today really can't be called music. Diamond performed professionally and sang well enough especially when compared to what the pop world churns out today.  The thrill of live performance was there in spades and that made it worth watching but it's not something I'll watch very often."}

The second word of the quoted line in SCREAM that goes &quot;stop f---ing with me&quot; is muted and also during that,Janet &quot;flips the digit&quot; which is blurred.

{"label": 6, "raw": "Until a DVD is released with footage from the Randy Rhodes era I could care less about ANYTHING else that's released on OZZY. There may be a good song here and there (& not to bash Zack, Jake E. & whoever else) but to me Ozzy without Randy is irrelevant. This, of course, excludes Sabbath. I have a VHS of the \"After Hours show\", excellent video but only mono sound, so I would LOVE a professional 5.1 or 6.1 release of it. I also have several bootleg concert VHSs and in at least one of them (Japan - Budokan I think) professional cameras can be seen. So the footage is out there.Ozzy...what's the problem??"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This supposed concert video is nothing but a collection of nonsense pre-concert, backstage, and audience garbage video. It shows 2 second clips of actual \"live\" band footage intermixxed with camera shots bouncing all over the place. A real concert video is just that, a live video of a band on stage playing their songs. Thank GOD I bought a cheap VHS version. I never even watched the whole thing. If you want to see a real show check out Iron Maiden's Rock In Rio or Primal Fear's The History Of Fear. This crap wouldn't be worth watching if it was sent to you for free!!!! I can't imagine Ozzy ever saw this and approved its release."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I LOVE Ozzy Osbourne.He is awesome live.He has one of the best stage presences in metal.But this DVD is not a real concert.What this is the music from the Live and Loud CD played in the background played over a bunch of crappy video footage.Half of it doesn't even belong here.The music is great,but the video footage is what messes this up.If you want a real Ozzy concert,buy &quot;Live At Budokan&quot;.If you want to get the REAL concert this was taken from,buy the CD.Also,The DVD does NOT have instant chapter access like the case says so.Plus,the DVD is two sided.This means that you have to flip it over in the middle of the concert."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "Once upon a time, say somewhere between 1994 and 1997, I'm convinced that OASIS truly was the meanest, biggest and bleedin' greatest band alive. They held the world in their hands and threw it on a roller coaster ride, of which a piece is caught in this video. Noel Gallagher had the talent of 100 years of composers together, Liam had enough charisma for a millennium. Yes, it was there and then and today's Oasis perhaps only have the shell left ot these days - but it doesn't really matter, since the wonders this band made during these years (perfectly sumaried in this video) is enough for a thousand lifetimes. Even if they won't live forever, this will!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This release was taken from their two shows at Earl's Court and Maine Rd in England.Kicking off with the jam fest that is known as &quot;The Swamp Song&quot; and then smoothly gliding into the duet &quot;Acquiesce&quot;, this is a good indication that the boys know how to rock.There isn't a sour note to be found here especially when Noel sits down on his stool for another rendition of &quot;The Masterplan&quot; or his otherworldly guitar solo in &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;.It was a bit odd to see Oasis perform &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; with a Beatles look-a-like, tribute band. Tongues firmly planted in cheeks?The one thing that keeps this video from being consistent are the interview bits they throw in between songs. I have to fast forward through them. Sorry guys.This is a better concert video than the previously released &quot;Live By the Sea&quot; as it shows Oasis at the height of their popularity, on bigger stages, in front of larger crowds, giving their all. Outstanding."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This captures Mary Chapin Carpenter at her best. In beautiful surroundings, MCC is relaxed and loose, laughing and telling stories and interacting with the audience. Watching her perform adds another layer of integrity to her music. There is a good selection of her music and the performance itself is a delight. Interspersed with the music are clips of behind the scenes preparation and interviews with other singers. I think MCC's greatest gift is her ability to connect with those who listen to her; this video makes it all the more evident."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Having never seen rage against the machine perform live, this is the closest I will see to that. The performances at concerts and festivels are energetic. and makes me wish that I had gotten the oppurtunity to see the band perform live. The video gives you the oppurtunity to see rage against the machine in action doing what they do best which was peforming live.The videos from their first two albums add a lot. With a lot of videos, your never got a change to see them on TV so it's a great chance to see their work with the visuals that the band added."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I love RATM. I was at the Irvine Meadows concert shown in this video - unfortunately, that one is the worst of the ones shown. It was a great show, but it's just poor quality. Part of that is because it's at night,  but it also seems kind of poor anyway. The other shows are pretty good, but  the video has flaws. The video collection is cool though, although the ones  from the first album are basically just Rage live, they're awesome."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Stevie Ray's first appearance was in 1983, along with Tommy Shannon on bass guitar, and Chris Layton on the drums (Double Trouble). There are 3 songs from that show, on this dvd: Pride & Joy, Texas Flood, and Voodoo Chile. Stevie Ray's 2nd appearance was in 1989. This time he had added Reese Wymans on keyboards, to the band Double Trouble (containing Tommy & Chris).I like both appearances, but I like the 1989 appearance the best. The songs include:1.The House is a Rockin' (This is written in large letters, on top of the front doors, at the Hard Rock Cafe in Houston, also they have a big replica of one of his guitars, mounted and revolving on top of the Hard Rock Cafe Houston.)2.Tightrope3.Leave my Girl Alone4.Cold Shot5.Crossfire6.Riviera Paradise7.Tick Tock8.Litte Wing (bonus video, showing legendary blues guitarist, and the manufacturing of guitars).Thanks!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Stevie Ray Vaughan was one awesome guitar player and underatted singer. The footage of the two concerts is a joy to watch. The second concert is a little better because it feature the talents of keyboardist, Reese Wynas who is a perfect foil for Stevie.However, this video should be so much longer. It clocks in at a mere 63 minutes and features three songs from one concert, six from another, the closing credits, and video clips of great guitarists with Little Wing playing in the background. All these scene changes are disruptive to the viewer. Also, more songs are needed. Nothing from the Soul to Soul record.Whereas Stevie Ray was a blue ribbon talent, I am sure there are more comprehensive concerts feature this late legend."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I first discovered Stevie on Austin City Limits. I was just blown away by his playing and singing.  I don't think I have ever viewed such a passionate player - Body and Soul.  There is not one wrong note -- it's complete bliss.  I was lucky enough to see him about four months before he passed, and it was the most fantastic musical experience of my life.  I remember it like it was last week.  He played with everything he had and it was beautiful.  I've been listening to him for years and I never get tired of him."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I always enjoy listening to Stevie Ray Vaughan's excellent guitar work. And it's an exceptional pleasure to watch as well as listen as he performs his fingertip magic. This DVD may not be the best in terms of audio and video quality or content production, but it's SRV. My rating is for the performance, not the production. As far as the production goes, I rate it 3.5 to 4 stars.Note:  I have no idea if there is a content or quality difference between the 1997 release and the 2011 release of this DVD. If anyone knows, please leave a comment."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you are a guitar player, you know what a talent Stevie was.A huge loss to the music and more specifically the guitar world.This was my first DVD pruchase and I love it.If you critique the sound, and are dissapointed with it, you are missing the point. Simply watching Stevie play was enough for me. Makes playing the guitar look easy, which it isn't.The contrasts between the two Austin performances was good, giving us a look at two phases in Stevie (and DT) music career.A &quot;must&quot; purchase for the guitar player, and, a great addition to anyone who can appreciate good blues and rock music.Missin you Stevie."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I purchased this DVD for my father. He is a big Stevie Ray fan and had recorded the Austin City Limits \"outtakes\" from these two shows a few years ago. He watches this tape constantly, so I figured that the real show would be quite good too. The set from the first show is great! It is the \"old\" Stevie. Great songs, great sound quality. The second performance isn't as good. The songs were not as recognizable and the sound just wasn't that good. It was quite muffled actually! I'm not sure why the quality dropped off between the two shows but it was pretty distracting. My father and I watched the video together and both commented about how it didn't sound good. Maybe it was just the DVD I got."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The first place I saw footage of this concert was on youtube and let me tell you I was blown away. The allman brothers band perform there best songs. So when I heard there was an official dvd release I was beside myself with excitment, That is until I read the reviews stating that this dvd only shows short segments of these performances intertwined with interviews and all I could think was WHY! why would the people in charge of releasing this do something so completely idiotic. This is a complete tragedy to think that this concert exsist in full on vhs but only in bits and peices on dvd. I can only hope that one day this company will have the common sense to release this in full as it was originally intended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like a lot of reviewers here, I bought the VHS edition when it first came out...nothing but the highest praise for that version.  There is perhaps no better single video that so superbly documents what these guys do onstage  ( at least not with Dickey Betts in the lineup ).  I was fortunate enought to have stumbled upon the DVD for rent first...which I did, and that was it, for reasons stated so well by everybody else here.  By the way, the VHS tape can be copied to DVD, which I heartily recommend!"}

Each musician performs his own incredible piece and the film  also includes each performer's reflections on Stevie and all culminating to  an incredible blues guitar jam with each musician having a solo.  Filled  with beautiful slides, riffs and solos and heartfelt thoughts each artist  pays tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan in his own way. A befitting tribute to a  once in a life time bluesman."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Released at the advent of the dvd revolution, &#34;James Taylor Live at the Beacon Theatre&#34; still stands as one of the best live dvds available, capturing a master songwriter at the top of his game.Taylor captivates the legendary New York venue for nearly two hours, performing a wide range of classic songs throughout his career, spanning from his earliest records to his then most recent recordings from his 1997 Grammy winning release, &#34;Hourglass.&#34; Classics like &#34;Fire and Rain,&#34; &#34;Handy Man,&#34; and &#34;You've Got a Friend&#34; are sung with the same care and ease that made them classics in their original form, and the new stuff is more than strong enough to hold its own against such longtime favorites.Taylor's voice is as smooth as ever, and his band is fantastic, aided no doubt by the sound and picture quality, which makes you feel like you're right there. &#34;Live at the Beacon Theatre&#34; is a must have dvd for all music fans."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you're one of the milllions of people who think James Taylor is all about \"Fire & Rain\" you should probably buy his greatest hits, 'cause this one ain't for you. BUT (and that's a very strong but) If you want to see an artist who is versitle, intelligent funny and just damn good, then you need to get this DVD. Every track in this concert is solid, from the classics like \"Mexico\" & \"Steamroller Blues\" To the new tracks like \"Jump Up Behind Me\" and \"Ananas\". Let me tell you.. There is not a dull moment during this concert, and I enjoy it every time I watch. It's a must have for any music lover. And for the masses whom I addressed earlier, \"Fire & Rain\" is there too and it's as good as ever."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I never, I repeat never tire of James Taylor's voice. There's nothing that soothes the nerves like the mellifluous tones from this master. As you can tell, I really love James Taylor's music and have been a fan for years. I  recently attended a concert of his and it was great.Concerning this  disc, the songs are performed to perfection with super audio and video  quality. You really get the sense you're there in the audience. His backup  singers are superb. There's even one number where one backup singer steals  the show!Lyric captioning is provided so you can sing along to his  songs. I wish all music DVDs had on-screen lyrics. My wife and I love to  sing along with our favorite performances. Surprisingly, this feature is  missing from many music DVD titles.If you are a James Taylor fan in the  slightest, you'll want this disc in your collection."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "James Taylor at his best. Although this concert is shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio, it is crystal clear.  The audio has a Dolby Digital 5.1 option which sounds great.  This has always been a favorite album to test a system with.  New Blu ray audio and video technology notwithstanding, a good system will enhance this and other older DVD's.  The editing is also top notch with quick cuts minimized. The back-up singers almost steal the show, but James is in good humor and fine voice. Taylor has been, and always will be one of my favorite singers, able to span generations and song styles. A great concert that sounds great too."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Mr. Taylor is a troubadour of the ages.  He and the artists he assembled for this production are nothing short of incredible as they hit every note with grace and craftsmanship.  The production quality approaches that of The Eagles \"Hell Freezes Over\" DVD, however, I still feel the Eagles hold the honor of producing the benchmark DVD to measure all other concert DVD videos by.  Nevertheless, this concert is a close second and will captivate any JT fan.  \"Shower the People\" actually brought a tear to my eye, sooo sweet! The sound quality of the DTS is exemplary and the DD 5.1 holds its own.  The camera work is right on the mark and the quality of the video is crystal clear.  Plug this DVD in and experience the Beacon Theater's warm ambiance from the front row and beyond. I've played this DVD dozens of times and look forward to the next."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I first saw JT, at the old McCormick Place in Chicago, back in 1972. His music has been with me ever since.Trying to describe, where James Taylor goes, within your heart and soul, is not an easy task. But I know, in mylifetime, few musicians go, where JT does. Few artists touch a certain part of your soul, in a way that he does. Honesty, complete sincerity, the open road of the free free highway, endless miles of wheatfields and prairies. A friend you can always count on.This concert, is a superb example, of what James Taylor is to all of us.He is a national treasure."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When funding for school music classes were being cut all over the country people kind of brushed it off as a non-necessity.  Studies prooved that many kids prosper in other academic subjects when taking a music class.  Art should be available for all kids in school as well as sports.  This benefit concert brought awareness to that.  Mariah, Celine, Gloria & Shania all appeard to support the cause.  And of course Ms. Aretha Franklin.  The performnaces were great.  Carol King was brought out as a special guest of Celine Dion.  The best part of the show was when the diva's sang You've Got A Friend and Natural Woman.  This show sounds even better with the 5.1 sound."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As many others have mentioned, this video is a behind the scenes look at the \"Yield\" album recording sessions.Each member shares something different, whether talking about the band's approach to the album or how the band has changed over the years, or their personal views on the band or music in general.  The performance sections sound great, and nearly every song on the album is performed (at least in part).Yield is my favorite album so seeing the creative process behind it is very cool.  Input from each member is represented fairly equally, and you can see a kind of \"rebirth\" happening during the making of that album.Before \"Pearl Jam Twenty\" was released, this was really the only footage of its kind showing the creative process within the band, but for me this video has a uniquely intimate feel, as if you were in the studio with them rather than just seeing footage of the band recording.  Definitely would recommend this for all Pearl Jam fans, especially if you love Yield!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is an intimate look at Pearl Jam rehearsing and recording they're incredible &quot;Yield&quot; album.  The DVD does not contain chapters or extras, which I'll admit is kind of a drag.  You have to start it at the  beginning and just watch it.  But upon watching it, you find Pearl Jam  lightening up and making music with smiles on their faces as they perform.  It's a great film which inspires me, as a musician, to play and write  better and love what I do."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Since I became a fan of Alice in Chains shortly AFTER Layne had died I was pretty much screwed in hearing or even seeing him perform. But after I spotted this sweet DVD hiding in a music store I just couldn't resist buying this to see Alice in Chains acoustic. Oh sure it might not have any power but by making there songs acoustic I could feel the powerful emotions running from this concert. Starting from Nutshell all the way to Killer is Me. There were some songs that were great but the way I see it is the exceptional ones are Brother, Would, Rooster, Sludge Factory and Frogs. Especially Would? because when I saw and heard this song I was remembering how strong he used to be and I saw him struggling...Overall this CD is AWESOME"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I do not need to even get into details.  This DVD performance is so important to the Alice in Chains legacy.  Also, it is perhaps the most meanful MTV Unplugged release of them all.  Layne is at his tormented best, so deep in pain, you get chills just hearing him sing.  Oh so sad, but yet he makes it sound so sweet and beautiful.  Jerry is just equal to Layne, never adding too much nor taking much away.  Layne and Jerry I think are the last great dou to emerge from the whole 90's rock explosion.  Get this DVD, all you need to do is love music, not even be a fan of AIC's, just love music.  Put this DVD in your player, push play, then close your eyes.  Let me know how you feel afterwards."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Which isn't on this collection, but then some  songs wouldn't translate to an unplugged perfomance.  The most amazing contradiction to this was \"Would?\", which absolutely rocks both on Dirt and on this DVD!.  All songs are great, though you can see Layne fading away and screwing the the lyrics on \"Sludge Factory\".  Layne, RIP.  Jerry Cantrell is the leader of this group that by this time had Mike Inez as the bass player.  Who's the drummer again?  My wife says he's one of the best drummers around.  What does she know???  Yeah, ok, he's good.  This DVD rocks, its a must have, even if you aren't a metal head.  what the hell is a metal head anyway?  This is just damn good music...  Oh yeah, I forgot, I'm a metal head."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been listening to these boys for years but honestly I had never seen them.  To see them doing many of their hits live was more of a thrill than I had imagined.  They are so talented and quite a charasmatic presense on stage.  Jerry and Layne harmonize together flawlessly.  The drums on &quot;No Excuses&quot; are perfect as well as the opening bass line for &quot;Would?&quot;It is sad in a sense to watch Layne because of his untimely death but his creative talents will live forever in this concert.Many times in the concert the band members talk to the audience and as I said before many of their best songs are played.This is a must for ANY Alice in Chains fan."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As a fellow fan of AIC, I treasure this honest and humble acoustic concert among Facelift and Dirt. It's one thing listening to that cringing voice of Layne's, but to watch them in action, it nearly made me cry. He looked awful, and it's a shame that such a talented soul had to die, especially in the manner that he did. This concert, however, is worth every penny that you have to pay. This is a must-watch for any true fan of grunge/metal/hard rock and they still make a statement on soft acoustic. Jerry Cantrell and Layne Staley's harmonies are great, and the atmosphere is so approachable and laid-back, as Layne sits on a stool and takes a whiff of a cigarette. Watch it and prepare to be moved."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you like music of the Strauss family, this is a superb concert with great sound from 1987. The concert lasts about 90 minutes, with very few  interruptions between pieces. The camera is mostly on the orchestra and  conductor (who looks like he is on his last legs) and the playing is  incredibly beautiful.  Kathleen Battle is on stage for the &quot;Voices of  Spring&quot; waltz and has a perfect coloratura for the part.  The sound on  the DVD is great and the program notes are good too.  This is a definite  buy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "January 1st, 2006Every New Year's Day when I view this superb DVD of the VPO and Karajan at their most musicianly ways, I am impressed by the ebb, flow, and hesitancy which is the way the music of the Strausses should be played.A conductor friend of mine who studied in Vienna and was conductor of an orchestra in Lvov said that Karajan and the VPO in this recording got it RIGHT!Especially entrancing is the music accompanying the horses from the Spanish Riding School and Karjan's darling, Kathleen Battle, doing a fine rendition of the Voices of Spring.The stage is sumptuously decked out in what seem to be all of the fresh flowers in Vienna and one gets the sense that this was a real event because the maestro died only two years later.I highly recommend this DVD and it will give YOUR New Year's Day something special to remember it by.Timothy Wingate  OTTAWA  CANADA"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The sound is perhaps marginally better than its CD equivalent, however, the DVD really doesn't take total advantage of the medium.  The views of the orchestra and conductor is very limiting.  Infact there are at most 6 vantage points of PARTS of the orchestra, conductor or choir.  One really never sees entire sections or for that matter the entire orchestra. The result is a feeling of &quot;claustrophobia&quot; and no sense of occasion.The tight shots are not sympathetic to the breadth and the grandeur of the music.  The DVD medium could have allowed switchable overviews of the whole choir and orchestra.Furthermore, the views are backlit to the point that the glare is annoying.As far as the performance is concerned, it is highly polished, but somewhat on the dull side."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Overall the sound and image quality of this DVD is OK but I am still quite disappointed by this release particularly the 4th movement &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;.  This performance is definitely worse than  the one recorded by Karajan in 1970's and may be not as good as that recorded in 1960's.  The tenor and baritone here are extremely weak and it feels like that they are singing serenade instead, which makes Beethoven's 9th symphony lack of strength.  Karajan's 1970's version of this work is the best and I wonder why he did not try to find someone as good as Peter Schreier and Jose van Dam.  Anyway, this release is still worth collecting since it's the only one on DVD.  Not too many choices."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Finally I bought this Karajan's last Beethoven's symphony cycle on DVDs and it was really exciting to take a close look at the conductor and orchestra while they were playing.  The orchestra and chorus are just excellent - exactly what I expected since I have their 1970s performance on CDs.  However, I am still quite disappointed by the 4th movement of the 9th Symphony because of the girly voices of the tenor and baritone, although the soprano and alto are brilliant.  Each time when I was watching this one, I had to be away from TV and speakers to avoid listening to tenor and baritone singing.  Anyway, it's still worth buying since I cannot expect another DVD from Karajan.  My rating for this symphony cycle is 5 stars for Symphonies nos. 1 - 6 &amp; 8, 4 stars for the 7th and 3 stars for the 9th.  The sound quality of this DVD is not as good as on CD but it's not a problem when turning the speakers louder."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have reviewed 5 Beethoven DVDs. Yes the recording is old....but can't imagine why video is so poor. The real problem is we buy these great masterpieces to experience the orchestra and not the conductor. We don't buy operas to watch the conductor nearly full time. I would agree there is little cinematography going on here....which seems criminal with such an important piece. I am nervous to get any Karajan piano or violin concertos les they not focus on the performer. I have a solution in Beethoven's masterpiece. Get the recent Blu-ray Vienna performance with Thielmann conducting in glorious 1080p DTS high definition. You will always judge every classical DVD by this performance....especially the direction and cinematography and of course picture and sound quality."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "\"The Four Seasons\" is probably one of the most famous and widely played symphony in the world. This version is beautifully shot and the sound quality is superb. Mr. Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic are in excellent form. It's always a treat watching Mr. Karajan conduct and play the harpischord. Reminding us how great composers like Beethoven did both in their days. Anne-Sophie Mutter's playing is both heavenly and flawless...and I'm a cellist!  This performance is like a wonderful bottle of Cabernet - very solid. Just perfect for a relaxing evening at home. It's great to have this version on dvd as testament to the growth and talent of Ms. Mutter.  Mutter's 1999 collaboration of \"The Four Seasons\" with the Trondheim Soloists is more energetic & uptempo. Mutter plays with a little more abandon. Unfortunately, the 1999 rendition is cd only and not available on dvd yet."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This performance was taped 17 years ago so the video quality isn't that sharp by today's standards, but the audio is excellent.  The new building - The Chamber Music Auditorium of the Berlin Philharmonic - is beautiful and perfect for such a performance.  Mutter's playing is up to her usual lofty standards, and of course maestro Herbert Von Karajan (he and Mutter are my reasons for granting the five stars) is larger than life, although he was obviously beginning to weaken at this point and sadly needed assistance in standing.  (He passed less than two years after this taping.)  Also provided on the DVD are backgrounds on Von Karajan and the new auditorium.  Overall an excellent presentation of Vivaldi's masterpiece."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have heard many fine four seasons and this one does not stand out. I still think the performance with Gerald Scwartz on the Delos label with the Seattle Symphony is more lush with better sound. The reason to get this on DVD is to actually see the performance. Yes we do get to see it.....but not very well. The video is quite poor which is perplexing since it is only 20 years ago. The other problem is the concert is only 45 minutes long which is chintzy. I think the standard for DVD concerts should be at least 90 minutes. Redemptively it is going for about $6 on Amazon. Looking forward to a Blu-ray version in DTS HD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Love it! I ordered it monday evening, and received it on saturday. The only thing I didnt like was when i selected \"play all videos\", for some reason it didnt play Valentine Girl. It was like it wasnt even on the dvd. It just skipped right over it. Maybe it had something to do with my dvd player, i dont know. But overall i love it :) and my 8 year old brother was dancing to it and watched it with me. He doesnt even know who they are and he loved it hahaha :)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I can agree with the other reviews: this video, which is titled to be an Elmo one, does NOT have much Elmo in it. This left my daughter asking for the furry red monster throughout the video. Elmo makes cameo appearances, popping in here and there for a minute or two. The rest of the video is full of fun songs (we love the Mighty Mighty Bosstones one) but not enough character interaction. A little disappointing, but older kids and adults will really appreciate the songs and guest appearances."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have to disagree with the reviewer who says this video isn't good for little kids.  My daughter LOVES this video and has since she got it for her first birthday.  She wants to watch it over and over.  Her 4 year old cousin wants to watch it whenever he comes to visit.It's fun enough that you don't mind watching it over and over again.  John Stewart and David Alan Grier are hilarious and the music is great.  The only part that I don't particularly care for is Rosie O'Donnell, but that's just because I don't like her.Buy it for your kids.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "In 1994 Tony Bennett reestablished himself as an icon for the MTV generation. He appeared on the network's Unplugged in support of his new albums Perfectly Frank and Steppin' Out. In so doing he endeared himself to a new generation of fans and received critical attention the likes of which is usually reserved for new rock stars.This disc is a record of the show. Bennett accompanied by the Ralph Sharon Trio perform twenty-one classics from the great American songbook all done in Bennett's cool sinature style. Highlights include a truly unplugged Fly Me To the Moon, It Had to Be You, Rags to Riches, and the signature I Left My Heart in San Francisco. The disc includes duets with Elvis Costello and k.d.

He constantly gives his best to his audiences, and the love and respect are repaid by audiences of all ages.  With this album, we all receive a gift of being exposed to at least one performer we hadn't been familiar with before.  How wonderful that Tony keeps us growing and therefore, knowing the joy and pleasure of great music."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It is really the politics of mass rock concerts that is on center stage in this film.  The locals on the island are revealed to be completely out of touch right wing nuts.  And large elements of the crowd become organized into left-wing activism against the seemingly inept and exploitive capitalists running the concert.  The whole thing degenerates into a kind of Monty Python skit on early 70s politics -- accompanied by wonderful music.  Not only does this film have performances by great musicians of the era, including Jimi Hendrix (his next to last performance before he died), Miles Davis, the Doors, Joni Mitchell and John Sebastian.  It also has performances from groups who were big at the time but are now largely forgotten such as Ten Years After."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I could go on and on, but briefly - if you are a filmmaker and you spend 100 times more time in your film showing gatecrashers throwing rocks at a tin wall than you do Miles Davis fronting one of the greatest jazz bands of all time, or Jim Morrison or Jimi Hendrix giving their last performances, than you are an idiot. This film is an agony to watch for any true music lover. Also, one last word folks (and this is true for Altamont too), don't judge the motives of the entire love and peace generation by the results of an incompetently organized rock event. As Seth and Amy would say, \"Really!\""}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A good film about a sadly bad organized/guided concert, courtesy of Mr. Ricky and Co.  One thing I can't understand about this sort of films about MUSIC festivals is that music sometimes is cut down to show the events that surround the concert.  For instance Miles Davis appears just 2-3 minutes (!!!) with his 1970 line up; Jethro Tull is clearly edited; Emerson Lake and Palmer appear on the former Laser Disc edition just a couple of minutes, later the company added Rondo, but where is the rest...  By the way once again the european DVD has more music than the USA one (where are Family and Taste second track)."}

The isle of Wight was more for the money than Woodstock. Some were kept out even if only one outta then of the crowd payed. We don't get the feeling that we're there with them as in Woodstock and the footage isn't as good but it is enjoyable, you can see some great performance, especially from Pete Townshend.

Also included are candid interviews with John, spectacular wildlife footage and some very special surprise selections. The running time is 113 minutes.

My wife and I turned the lights down, cranked up the Bose surround speakers, and were enraptured for the entire duration of that outstanding performance. This was John at his very best. The concert was performed in front of a small audience in a cozy setting, and we felt every bit a part of that audience. If you're a John Denver fan, I don't believe you can go wrong with this excellent DVD. As it says on the package: the video is crystal-clear, as is the CD quality sound.

There are also some interesting monologues peppered throughout the concert where Denver shares his concerns about the environment and wildlife preservation.

The drugs, nudity and disturbing images were pretty cool to me then, and are even more intresting now than ever.

Placing Type O Negative over the soundtrack to a 1930's black and white silent film is like trying to watch \"Dawn of the Dead\" overdubbed with \"The Monster Mash\".  Utterly awful.

Although devised to help children fall asleep, I am an adult and I purchased it for myself for those nights I have difficulty turning off the noise in my mind and falling asleep.  I would not restrict this to bedtime however.  It is enjoyable enough to listen to anytime one needs to de-stress.  I feel my money was well-spent on this and I would not hesitate to purchase this as a new-baby-gift or for any child's birthday.  I don't like all lullaby-type albums, but this one is a winner.  Another excellent one is a collection by Windham Hill called \" On a Starry Night \".  I have played both of these to rock babies to sleep and also just to have lovely, soothing music to relax with.  I highly recommend this c d."}

The music is from all over the globe so there is a diverse range of sounds, but it is all pleasant.  I have listened to the CD over and over again and still I am not sick of it.  I also like the liner notes.  These songs are about such interesting things.  For instance one talks about children being afraid of foxes coming and another talks about how both the baby and the cat have golden cradles, but that the baby's is nicer.  I really recomend this CD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As a fan of Rutter and the Cambridge Singers, I knew their take on Handel's Messiah was a natural for me. Although the sound of the Cambridge Singers has changed over the years, it has never lost its distinctive hallmarks, as on this recording. Rutter has a first-class group of young soloists, and I especially like the soprano and bass soloists. I know that Melanie Marshall might not be able to touch Anne Sofie von Otter's renditions of the alto parts on Pinnock's DG recording, but she gives a truly heartbreaking account of He was despised. Throughout, the tempi is brisk and bright, but yet the performance bubbles with conviction and commitment. Rutter also shines as a choral conductor, eliciting a superb overall sound from his choir and crafting avery nuance intricately in the manner of Robert Shaw. I think this would probably be one of my top dogs for Messiah, alongside Pinnock, Gardiner and the live Cleobury-King's College version."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Joe Satriani is capable of much more.  I think this album along with the first one proves that Joe just can't write actual rock songs (outside of his solo stuff) that are more than just mediocre.  Everything is just so bland and average.  I wish he would go back to doing Surfing with the Alien type music.  He was so great and inspired back then.  Anyway, I know people here don't like the comparison, but the new Van Halen Album \"A Different Kind of Truth\" absolutely destroys this waste of time.  I hope CF changes things a lot for their next album.  I will keep buying them, but I'm starting to lose faith that they will come out with anything decent in their current form.  I do think, however, the drummer is really good, and that shows on this album."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This album is a big improvement over the first Chickenfoot disc. The playing is tighter and seems more inspired. Sammy is singing great and the annoying, recycled cliches that were passing for lyrics on the last CD are less obvious. This band has such potential to make some really memorable music. It is just a shame that they won't call in some old friends to give them some songwriting help. Sammy is the only one in the band that has ever written a lyric and although this is the best stuff he has written in the last decade, that isn't saying that much. I hope that they can pull off releasing another. The 3 best tunes on this disc are: Up Next, Come Closer and Big Foot."}

What surprised me was the raw sound of \"three and a half letter\" in which Sammy screams, \"I NEED A JOB, I'M WILLING TO WORK, BUT I NEED A JOB!\"  If that doesn't sum up this obamanation economy I don't know what does.

You wont find any jaw dropping momemts here, but you will find great old school rock tunes. A pleasure to listen to and I'm glad Mikey and Sammy can still rock even at their age lol.

If you like the first album I recommend this as it may be a little more mature but still plenty of excellent guitar work from Satch. I saw them live in 2009 and am glad they stuck together because they were jaw dropping and this album does not disappoint."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I agree with quite a few others that almost all the songs here are generic sounding Sammy Hagar songs (maybe something solo).  Not even the great guitar player can save these songs.  The only song I like is the last one, Something Gone Wrong!  And that describes the rest of this CD for me.  I was really surprised by the first Chickenfoot CD, the songs were really catchy GREAT HOOKS that had you stompin your foot!  And I'm not even the biggest Hagar fan, I did like Montrose and selective Van Hagar!  But that first CD really nailed it and it was a surprise hit going GOLD!  I just dont see the same thing happening here, I dont think it's going to catch on like the first one!"}

The song Anastasia is getting good rotation on Sirius Octane, and I was instantly hooked - because its the best guitar work Slash has done since GnR. As is this whole album. While Myles voice can a bit too high pitched at times - Slash makes up for it. Great guitar work all over this album and the band is a perfect compliment.I hope this is the beginning of more from Slash and these guys.

{"label": 6, "raw": "I won't breakdown and analyze each individual track but this album as a whole absolutely rocks! If you are a Rush \"fan\" and don't immediately love it, you should keep playing it - because Rush's musical brilliance is there if you are open-minded enough to really listen for it. If you are reading the reviews due to an indecision to buy Clockwork Angels...don't waste another day and just do it.I believe that most people that download and buy only single tracks are cheating themselves because you must listen to Clockwork Angels from start to finish. This is a concept style album which Rush fans have come to enjoy and this is no exception, so I strongly recommend having enough time to listen to Clockwork Angels in it's entirety. While most significant rock music artists of the last 40 years are \"nursing\" their careers with greatest hits tours and uninspiring new music, Rush hasn't lost their fire or creativity."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have always liked Rush since I found out about them in 1978 with the release of Hemispheres. A buddy was already listening to them known through his older brother. His brother took us to school one morning and was jamming to hemispheres. I was hooked. Bought the album asap and began buying their other albums as well. Their music has a much different feel for me now days and it seems although the album is still good, it lacks something that the members of Rush had in the earlier days. Not disappointed in the album, it is more or less my taste of music has changed as well because I have not heard a big winner from the last several albums from Rush. I may like a song or two but that will be it. In the past, I usually liked the entire album with maybe one or two songs that I did not like."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been a Rush fan forever. I have loved most of the stuff they have put out but always have found a few tracks to be duds on every recent release.

I even like the muddy mix, flashy wiz kid studio production and the cover art. This is the album I have been waiting for! Thank you Neil, Alex and Geddy for making this fan a freaking happy one!!!"}

I haven' like anything they put out the past 10 years or so (+/-), but this album rocks! musically at the top of their game with this album! holy cow, I downloaded the MP3 album expecting typical crappy Rush, but was I pleasantly surprised!! hell, it reminds me of Dream Theater somewhat!

I sort of lost interest after Moving Pictures with all the synths, but decided to buy tickets to their upcoming show in Baltimore.  I bought Clockwork Angels just to know the new stuff, not expecting much.  Well, I have to say, this is now my favorite Rush album.  Extremely heavy, this sounds like it could have been released between Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures, or even earlier!  Great arrangements, interesting lyrics, all around a powerhouse album.  If you are a Rush fan and are contemplating buying this, do it.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Being only familiar with Rush's big radio hits, I took a chance on this new concept album on a whim. I'm always looking for new and interesting music. The album starts with a bang with Caravan, a hard-driving, pace changing song which hooked me almost immediately. BU2B also quickly clicked with me, although I don't care for its anti-religion tone. From there the songs seem to get too long and too repetitive for my taste. I would prefer lengthy solos without hearing the lyrics repeated ad nauseam. An exception is the beautiful Halo Effect (clocking in at 3:14). The album regains some steam and momentum with Headlong Flight, and finds a pleasing ending with The Garden. The digital booklet is beautifully illustrated and helps the listener to understand the story Rush is attempting to tell. Purchasing this album has spurred me to investigate more Rush music on Pandora. So far, I'm still partial to Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Subdivisions, and New World Man."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "Guitar World named Rush and Van Halen the top 2 albums of 2012, and it's well deserved. (as much as I hate lists, this one I agree)This is pure Rush. It reminds me of classic Rush, it's like nothing has changed. It's a reminder of why we love Rush in the first place.Rush has continued to make great music after so many years with the same lineup, that's not easy for any band.I won't go into why this album is great as so many other reviewers have mentioned already.Just listen for yourself."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The problem with modern production techniques is they compress the dynamics, making everything loud; then they increase the volume past the technical limits of the CD. This is evident on the Clockwork Angels release, and there are many areas where it is impossible to hear the nuances of Neil Peart's drumming, to follow Geddy Lee's bass lines, or to tell just what exactly Alex Lifeson is doing on his guitar. The mix wasn't as bad as the original master of Vapor Trails, but it is clearly not as good as it should have been."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "No, really. Signals was about technology throughout and this one is about life's journeys. Signals has always been my favorite album by cohesiveness alone but this one is now second. I loved Vapor Trails for the first few years of it but I finally agreed that it had sound issues. Snakes and Arrows, I tried to like it and thought I really did but now, Clockwork Angels has surpassed both by miles. The sound is back and the songwriting and the essence of Rush is back. Everything a Rush album should be, this one takes the cake. They even surprised everybody with several great ballads. Honestly, the only ones I skip(not because they are not good songs but because of the sound)are Caravan and BU2B. Too harsh sounding, IMO. They corrected that with the balanced sound of \"Clockwork angels\" the song. And the rest of the songs flow perfectly after that.Rush has done it right this time, again."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "What strikes me most about this album is its lack of nervous playing.  I love Rush's music, but there was always a sense that they were trying to prove themselves (to us? each other? the world?).  With this album, they seemed to have finally arrived at a well-deserved level of confidence in their skills, one that comes across both in their performance and song writing.  Particularly with respect to the latter, all of these tunes sound as if there was concerted effort to place their considerable chops at the service of \"the song.\"  No one member outshines the other; each is working together, and with each other, to create the best tune possible.  This combination of confidence, incredible playing, teamwork, and humility makes this a very special album.  What a joy it is to hear the potential in one's favorite band be realized."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When I first heard the first two singles from this album before it came out I was psyched Rush was doing an album this heavy but when I bought the album it leaves a lot to be desired. it starts off with a band with Caravan, BU2B, and Clockwork Angels but after that it took a confusing left turn for me. Some of Geddy's vocals are a little too shreaky and turns me off from the songs and some of their string arrangments on this album dosen't help either. I have to say i like 7 out of the 12 songs on here. I recommend their earlier records though."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The band was in shambles after Test for Echo, due to Neil's losses. Their follow-up, Vapor Trails, showed a band struggling to remain a band. Vapor Trails was a tremendous letdown for a lot of fans, myself included, not to mention holding the award for probably one of the worst sounding albums ever released by a major label, but it contains a lot of passion. Snakes and Arrows has some great moments and a few decent tracks overall, but it falls flat as whole. With Clockwork Angels we see Rush back in full swing. They want it again and they're pushing themselves to be as good as they know they can: Solid playing at a very high level, complex and intricate arrangements that keep your attention, and a passion that shows they really want to make something great!We thank you! Can't wait to see it live!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I really like this album! The band is very tight. Lots of change ups & tempo changes & some of the heaviest playing i have ever heard rush do. Yes it's a concept album but you can pick any song and just play it. musially i think it is the best album they have ever made. lyrically 2nd best. Under 2112 i would say this is there 2nd best album ever. They are just playing there guts out on this album.It's like there playing while the room is on fire around them. Because of the concept aspect of the album only lyrically it reminds me of 2112. Musically it reminds me of the albums counter parts or snakes & arrows on steroids. Geddy's voice sounds killer on this record & this album show's some of the best music Alex & Neil have ever done together. If you have ever liked just one song rush has done you will like this album."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wow! Rush is one of the few \"older\" bands that still manages to put out solid music every few years or so. I've been listening to Clockwork Angels since it came out in June of last year. Every song is very good to great, featuring some of their best melodies to date. Geddy's bass playing is at an all time high, while Lifeson creates some memorable riffs and Peart fills in all the rest like the legend he is. One of the most complete albums I have heard by any band. Leave it to Rush to put out one of their best albums 40 years into a career. Anyone giving this less than 4 stars needs some serious help."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "My favorite Rush album is Caress of Steel and what that album has that this one lacks is a crisp, crackling bite to the guitar and a clear depth to the drums and bass. Rush seems to have forgotten the importance of negative space, i.e., intervals between the sounds that give these sounds their definition and, I would argue, their power. The songs on the digitally recorded and over-processed Clockwork Angels are buried in a wall of noise and they must fight to be heard like poltergeists trapped in a snowy television set.As you might guess, I don't listen to a whole lot of modern music and have a bias against albums that are mastered with the amount of dynamic compression that is today's industry standard. This bias isn't just an aesthetic preference. I find that dynamically compressed music tires my ears after about ten minutes. Clockwork Angels may well be a significant sonic improvement over recent recordings like Vapor Trails (I wouldn't know) but it's still not enough to make me want to listen to it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Clockwork Angles has surpassed Moving Pictures as my favorite Rush album.  Every song on Clockwork Angels is rock solid.  When I listened to it for the first time, it sounded a bit noisy, but each time I put it on, it got better and better.  The last song, The Garden, is especially good.What these three gentlemen continue to produce never ceases to amaze me.  Their musicianship and lyrics are better than ever, but the thing I love the most about Rush is the sincerity that comes out in their music.  There's nothing artsy fartsy about these guys.  They are for real."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like most new Rush CDs, I had to listen to this several times before I could form an opinion.  This is a good Rush disc.  The music sounds great & there are many good songs.  Geddy's voice sounds more mature.  However, his vocals sound tired; that is the only way I can describe them.  While I am always happy to get new Rush material, I can't really point to a specific song/highlight on the disc.  There is just something about this disc that disappoints.  I can't put my finger on it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Yes, a little play on the name of the group - but if you are a fan of Rush, then this will be a welcome addition to your collection (as it is to mine).  Even after all this time, these guys still rock.  They have proven themselves to be world class musicians - tight music, tight lyrics - a tight band.People may think that they have outlived their usefulness - and if you think that, you could not be more wrong.  If it has been awhile since you have listened to Rush - by all means get this CD.  If you never heard of Rush (and you may not have) - again, get this CD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This band has hung around for 40 years, made some great albums in the early 1980's, continued from there with repetitive material but great concerts, and now suddenly they are better, massively better.  Not only does Clockwork Angels succinctly present a lifetime of life's lessons in precise lyrics, but these guys really really rock.  Rather than discuss each track, which are all incongruent with Top 40 tunes, I'll just say it's their most cohesive album ever.  No other band out today can but hide and listen in the force of this material.  The last track, Garden, is beyond thorough composition - it can only be compared to the great allegories of literature and classical music.  A few great rock bands have survived, but Rush is the only one I know that still thrives."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I had a hard time getting into this cd first listens until I turned UP the volume and then it hit me...WOW, this sounds just like you would here in concert and it packs a powerful punch. After that it all became clear...Rush created the perfect sound that can be faithfully recreated on the road in fact I consider this a kinda studio live recording despite whatever mastering mumbo jumbo went on. They erased that line between studio and live and I think they succeeded with flying colors. Does that mean muddled? I don't know but they consciously engineered CA to sound this way, it is no mistake, due to the time spent to create an epic composition and product. CA starts kinda slow but builds and literally thrashes akin to Vapor Trails refined in places and is VERY hard and smokin. The band dips into their roots and updates with modern prog rock/metal sensibilities to wonderful effect. I love this recording..."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Just bought a copy of this incredible album released by the legendary canadian power trio RUSH. It was with great pleasure that I saw our Brazilian edition bringing the lyrics and a very good artwork (the same as the imported CD's). About the band, these guys are playing better and better, year after year. Solid Rock and Roll, as usual. My favourite track? # 9 \"Headlong Flight\". Same style as \"Snakes And Arrows\", which, for me, is more than enough."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The title description speaks for itself.I won't bore you with a song by song review because all the songs are amazing from the beginning to end...Classic sound with a modern twist.Rush is that one band that will never disappoint.They remain one of my fave bands ever,if not favorite and I'm sure they will still put out albums after this release.If you're a Rush fan pretty much from the beginning,this is for you.You won't take the disc out of your player.Yes,I still buy cd's and will until they are not made anymore  Rock n roll!!!!  \\m/"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have to admit it.  I didn't care for it much at all - and I am a pretty big Rush geek.  But I kept listening and found that it has grown on me.  I still think Geddy's singing is a bit stretched at times, and I would have enjoyed more solos from Alex.  But overall its a very, very solid concept album and I am very glad they went this route on this album.  Great story, great music, and a nice change of pace.Great work guys!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the 20th studio album from RUSH, and their best in decades, This new release finds Rush in top form and at the height of their success they are just as big as they were back in the day,Rush never fit into the neat box because you either got it or you didnt, every track on this release is amazing it captures the best of Rush removed keyboards for a more stripped down feel Bass,Guitar and drums, If your a fan it's a must own, every track is stellar on this brand new release from Rush, In my opinion their best in years!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "there last one snakes and arrows & this album was to me are 2 pf there best album since presto.id say i love probably 10 of the 12 songs.at least 5 could be played live with there classic hits!gettys voice isnt what it use to be but his voice is mature and sounds great.great riffs,drums,bass and solid song writing.and to me i will be listening to it for years to come and proud to put next to prestoand it sounds like most people who dont like the album is because of the compression which i dont blame them.you shouldnt need an audiophile system to have it sound good!luckly my tube amp gives it that added analog sound.BUT if your judging the album quality by mp3s you must be shot in the HEAD!at once!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'm a big fan of Rush.....and this is a decent album.  However....i am REALLY getting annoyed with digital compressed recordings!  Younger folks will not understand my ramblings on this issue.....but if you grew up on analog recordings of your favorite music....you KNOW how much better it sounds. ALL music these days has the same compressed sound!  Go back and listen to your older recordings of Rush and Van Halen....or ANY other band from the analog era.  It sounds SO much more open and dynamic."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have not purchased the cd as of my review,but I have listened to all the song's numerous times on YouTube.This album is FANTASTIC..I still can't believe anyone would give this gem less than 4 stars..but everyone does have the right to their own opinion.But this is so good,just listen to the tune called The Wrecker..Turn it up,and close your eyes..It just sticks in my mind..I have been a big fan of Rush since the very beginning,and have seen them quite a few Tours,and hearing this great music on Clockwork Angels has me ready for another show..Just an incredible new cd from our friends from the North.."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Can it get any better than this?  \"I submit that it CANNOT!\"  This guy is so hilarious.  My husband and I got this CD after cracking up at his stand up on Comedy Central.  Brian Regan is one of those comedians you love to see in clubs.  You leave reciting some of his stuff and begin to laugh with yourself just thinking about it.  Everything is clean and nonoffensive as someone else said, but to be honest, I didn't really think about that until reading their review.  But it's true, very much like Bill Cosby Himself.  Love it!  The only downside is with it being a CD, you can't see his facial expressions, which if you have seen him on TV, you know what I mean :)  I wish there was more of his stuff available."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Brian Regan, IMO is extremely under-rated! It seems just about anyone I ask if they've ever heard of Brian Regan, their response is: \"who\"??? well, I wish more people knew of him because he is just \"laugh-out-loud\" funny! Excellent CD, by the way... I saw him Live recently and he did a lot of jokes from this CD... buy it! it's hilarious! and one more addition, he's a \"clean\" comic, so your kids can listen to this CD too!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Brian is one funny guy; I could not stop laughing. I first heard him during a long flight back from Japan and I must have looked like a moron sitting in my chair laughing as hard as I was; there were tears running down my face.  That was 2 years ago &amp; I've been looking for this CD ever since.  I finally got my copy &amp; listened to the whole thing driving from San Antonio to Austin and just cracked up the whole way - it was almost dangerous for me to be on the road.He reminds me of what my life was like growing up - back then a lot of it seemed pathetic, but now it seems pretty darn funny!Great CD &amp; you'll like it - no foul language too.  That's a real plus these days."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Well, I know I'm a little late to this CD (12 years) but I looked it up on Amazon after hearing the first selection on Laugh USA Sirius XM last week.  I listen to that station for some smiles and giggles when I'm driving.  Brian Regan came on talking about \"you too\" and \"take luck\" and I almost had to pull over to the side of the road.  I was laughing so hard it really was dangerous!So now I have the CD and I listen at home where it's much safer for everyone.  It's just hilarious, no two ways about it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Brian Regan is an amazingly funny man. Not only is his act clean enough for everyone, but his observations on life are truly on the money and exquisitely made. From ridiculous spill-and-spell names like \"Aymie\", to psychotic doughnut consumption habits, there is no area of American life safe from Regan.I am especially fond of \"Hooked on Phonics\", \"Kid's Party Games\", \"Donut Lady\", and \"Spider Webs and Bees\", although there is not a clunker on the entire CD. For truly funny comedy that the entire family can share, this CD is impossible to beat.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go find a doughnut with icing all over it, but sprinkles only on one side."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "There are a select few comedians who are straight up funny. Some (cough -Dane Cook- cough) use profanity to cover up the fact that their routines aren't really that funny. Not so with Brian Regan. He is a tremendously smart guy, who plays a stupid guy in his comedy.Since he has so much physical comedy though, his facial expressions alone can make you burst out laughing, I was worried that it wouldn't translate well to just audio. I was wrong. From \"Stupid in School\" to \"Fishing Shows\" this is Brian at his best. Two thumbs way up."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I heard of Brian Regan many many years ago, I believe he did an HBO special with his brother about 15 years ago....I hadn't heard much more about him in the years to come, but he came to Phoenix to do a show, and I heard him on the radio, so I bought his CD, even though it's a few years old already....I loved the CD, and my wife laughed throughout it even though she tends to get bored listening to comedy CDs....It contains mainly observational humor about growing up, so I listened to it in the car while driving the family places, and my kids love it too (aged 11 & 6)....It is family friendly humor, which is hard to find....and it does wonders for long distance family road trips....He seems to be actively touring the comedy club scene, I just wish he would put out a new CD soon, considering this one is going on 8 years old now...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I listen the entire new album of Chris Rea. I never hear a Chris Rea album before. This is an excepcional, complex & mesmerize album. This is the best album of this new century & one of the best blues album of all time. Eleven albums in one year !!! This is incredible. You must listen to it to believe it. The latin blues by English man sounds superior to the latin blues make for sud americans & spanish people. All the albums are great & sounds very very diferent. My favorites are: 60's & 70's, Chicago Blues,Electric Memphis Blues, Latin Blues & Ballads Blues. I recomend very much."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I didn't actually realise that this set came as a fairly sizeable book (duh!). Blue Guitars is a labour of love, and it shows. Rarely, if at all, have I known an artist to produce 11cd's of great songs. It's an interesting journey. The book, with it's paintings and an in -depth interview with Chris Rea, are almost a throwback to the old vinyl days of studying the album sleeve as you listen to the music. Rea's slide playing has never sounded better and his dark brown 'trombone ' of a voice carries you through the journey from the source of the blues through slavery, into the various manifestations of it up to the '60-70s. Great stuff.A minor point - The CD sleeves in the book are VERY FRAGILE so will not stand up to too much use."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wow.  I just came across this CD for real cheap, and boy was I glad I got it.  I have listened to lots of blues players of different types, and the guitar of Albert King is amazing, especially on this disc.  I have his In Session CD live with SRV, which was a really strong CD, but this particular CD presents a better sound of his guitar, in my opinion.  It sounds sweeter, more well-rounded, powerful, diverse, and dead-on.  I really love Albert King's work, and I always wish songs like \"Blues Power\" and \"Blues at Sunrise\" were much much longer because this type of slower blues has the sweetest licks.  Get this CD.  It radiates such warm, positive energy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you wonder where Stevie Ray Vaughn got his outstanding guitar licks on  &quot;Texas Flood&quot;, listen to &quot;Blues Power&quot;.  They're all  there in this original by Albert King.  I saw B. B. King on TV a few times  around 1970, but on Sunday nights around 1971 there was a show on PBS of  rock concerts from the Filmore. One night Albert King was on there, a film  of part of this very performance!  That is what cinched it for me as a  blues fan.  I'd never heard guitar playing that touched so close to home.  Every phrase was dynomite.  I can't recomend this album enough."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The best meditation cd money can buy. Also indispensible mood music for writing, painting, blissing out, anything really except driving. My 11-year old son used to be disturbed by the quiet power of this music, now he loves reading to it. I often throw &quot;Doje Ling&quot; into the cd player when I've got a heavy day of deadlines before me. Works wonders. For those curious about meditation books, pick up, &quot;Meditation Made Easy&quot; by Lorin Roche. That and his and Camille Maurine's, &quot;Meditation Secrets for Women&quot; are the two absolute best books out there and complement &quot;Dorje Ling&quot; perfectly."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "After Yatra this is the next of Parsons' discs to own, in my opinion. I would say this is more for the seasoned electronic music listener. The disc starts off with the piece, Tantra. This contains Tibetan trumpets, large hand cymbals, and Tibetan monks throat singing. The track builds to an exciting conclusion.The tracks, Tsaparang, Lauhaul Valley, and Dorje Ling follow in a similar vein. These are deep excursions into meditative electronic music. K-2 is a lighter piece that ends the disc. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "DeaD pREz is as innovative as &quot;Lets Get Free&quot; on &quot;Turn Off The Radio&quot;. For those who dont get it you probably never will. This is the essence of Hip Hop which has never left our thoughts and is on a rise as a voice for generations.They have proven to me that the art of Hip Hop is alive and livin' and breathin'. THIS IS A MIXTAPE I.E. YOU HAVE THE RECYCLED BEATS. In my mind the songs they remade are better than ever. This is a message for us all to recieve on all levels.

{"label": 6, "raw": "The heading is not a bold statement its the truth. While other rappers' mixtapes are all guns, drugs and which hoe did it with freddy kreuger last night, Dead Prez devotes mixtape time to give you insight and thought provoking rhymes. Standout Tracks: TURN OFF THE RADIO, THAT'S WAR, WE NEED A REVOLUTION, FOOD CLOTHES & SHELTER part 2, SOULJA LIFE MENTALITY(Soulja Slim RIP), GET UP, KNOW YOUR ENEMY, IT WAS WRITTEN, NO LOVE, THO IT UP, HIP HOP(RBG mix)etc. Filler: Sellin d.o.p.e.. Bottom Line: Dead prez's mixtapes are better than most rappers mixtapes and albums if you want to take it that far. On some songs they use other people's beats like the late Aaliyah's I need a resolution and Black Rob's Whoa but they put their on positive spin on these track so Im okay with it. Both mixtapes by Dead Prez are strongly recommended by me as well as their albums."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Ok, first off, Enya rocks.  If you don't know that already, go buy her compilation album, Paint the Sky with Stars.  It will enlighten you.  If you already know how good she is and you aren't desperate to buy everything she's ever done, there is something wrong with you.All right, so maybe Enya isn't for everyone.  But you will likely appreciate her if you have ever been truly moved by a dreamy piece of music.  She is soft, soulfull, and dynamic.  And yeah, so her music all sounds the same, but when it's so good, how can you complain?Highlights from The Memory of Trees include &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot;, and &quot;On My Way Home&quot;."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A clasically-styled and introverted album, Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.  Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely, quiet voice.  But within every introvert is an inferno, and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.If you've never heard Enya before, you might want to start with one of her more popularized works, like Watermark, just to play it safe.  But if you're already a fan, then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons.' 'The Celts, Watermark and Day...' were all pleasant and admirable throughout, but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically. But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory...' reaches those heights and beyond. It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting. I'm actually glad that this song didn't get overexposed the way Only Time did. It makes it that much more special to all who own this album."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Enya is such a wonderful artist, truly given a gift from God!! Every song on this album is a delight to listen to. \"Once You Had Gold\" is a song I'm actually using in a fanfiction story I'm writing, and I hardly ever do \"songfics.\" But this song is so beautiful and poignant and angsty that it fits perfectly with the message I'm trying to get across.Other special favorites are the title song, Anywhere Is, Athar Ar Neamh, China Roses . . . Okay, let's just say the whole album is a classic!!! I'm not really into new age music, but Enya is different! You will not go wrong buying her albums, and especially this one is a must-have!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is not another lousy Celtic New Age album - it is a genuine piece of music, well written and performed with emotion. It never fails to send shivers up and down my spine for some reason... Ever since I heard Orinoco Flow Enya has cast her spell on me. She is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic. On this album every song is as perfect as it can get on a pop record, with melodies that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain. I have every Enya album to date, but this one seems to be particularly special. A must for any music lover!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I must say that while I truly love Enya's music, this album is my least favorite of all of hers.  It is good, don't get me wrong, but I do not feel as engrossed in the music on this one as I am in the other ones.  Ok, so maybe, Enya has bored me a bit this time, but some of the tunes are awfully good, such as, &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; and &quot;Anywhere Is.&quot;  So, I would never dismiss it as a poor pick, and I do feel that it is a valid Enya album.  It is full of beautiful songs (as is the case with all of her records), and the vocals are ethereal as always.  I would recommend it, though if I were you, I would let this be my first Enya experience, for the rest in the line, and those before it, are, to me, a little better."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I heard this CD at a friends and when track 4 Athear Neamh came all it was breathtaking.  The clarity of voice and the beautiful smoothness bluesy oboe-like flutey vocal range is gorgeous.  I mentioned it to my friend and she said this is her favorite Enya CD.  Admittedly I got the CD just for the one track and I'm not sorry.  This remains one of the best in my collection of great songs and I can record it alongside other greats e.g. Dean Martin or The Carpenters and Enya measures up.  My husband and I also picked out China Roses as a good track.  Rarely does one finds a CD where just the one astounding track is worth the price of an entire CD, but this is one of those jewels."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "(...)She is one of a kind, and this album only enhances her contribution to musical enjoyment. As always, the instrumental opening sets a mood, followed by the lively \"Anywhere Is\", a song which grew on me each time I listened. Each song is exquisite, but for me, \"China Roses\" is the most delicately crafted song. However, \"Once You Had Gold\" which isn't mentioned as much is another of the highpoints. \"On My Way Home\" is a fitting conclusion to the album. I have heard rumors that not everybody likes Enya, and if there is a person who doesn't like her, then he or she shouldn't get this CD, but for everybody else, this is one of the essential CD's for your collection."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "THIS ALBUM LIKE OTHERS IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL, THE ALBUM STARTS WITH THE MEMORY OF TREES-A BEAUTIFUL INSTRUMENTAL &amp; VOICES, THEN GOES ONTO ANYWHERE IS, ANOTHER BRILL TRACK, PAX DEORUM IS VERY CLASSICAL IN SOUND, FROM WHERE I AM IS AN ELEGANT PIANO INSTRUMENTAL.  CHINA ROSES IS A BEAUTIFUL LOVE SONG HOPE HAS A PLACE REMINDS YOU OF PREVIOUS ENYA TRACKS LIKE EXILE &amp; EVACUEE. TEAHOUSE MOON IS A CATCHY KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTAL AND ONCE YOU HAD GOLD IS SIMILAR TO MARBLE HALLS IN SOUND AND THEN WE GET TO THE SPANISH TRACK: LA SONADORA AND TO FINISH IS THE UP BEAT TRACK:- ON  MY WAY HOME."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'm an Enya fan, to be sure, and this CD offers a nice  &quot;mix&quot;,(for lack of a better word) of styles. &quot;Pax  Deorum&quot; with it's chilling Latin refrains. &quot;La Sonadora&quot;  having a Spanish torreador ballad feeling, and the absolutely beautiful  refrains in &quot;Athair Ar Seamh&quot; display her vocal and writing  talents. And who can deny that &quot;China Roses&quot; is one of the most  smooth,sweet vocal pieces to grace a CD?? The Memory of Trees is a stellar  Enya disc!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I have been a fan of Enya's music ever since the release of her second  album Watermark and after listening to this particular offering, I can  safely say it is the most exquisite music I have ever heard.  The vocal  layering and music form an absolutely magical sound that is uniquely Enya's  own;  and in combination with Roma Ryan's poetic lyrics, this is definitely  a match made in musical heaven.  There are no misses here as every song can  stand on it's own merit.  If you enjoy Enya's music this is an absolute  must have for your collection.  She just keeps getting better...."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is positively one of the best albums ever released by Enya.  This album is filled with such powerful songs as 'Pax Deorum' and 'La Sonadora' that you will never want to listen to anything else.  From the very first song, 'The Memory of Trees', you will be enthralled and drawn by the music of this album.  These tunes are great to listen to when you are feeling down or sad, or pretty much any time.  These songs will captivate your heart with their powerful message and make you not want to let go or turn it off.I would suggest this album to any Enya fan right away, and even to those who have never heard Enya sing before.  You will get a great impression of her songs and be more interested to buy her other albums."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This CD is absolutley FANTASTIC!!! How can this woman do this over and over again?!?!?!?  This CD is relaxing, and I think the songs found this CD are like the day's intervals of a person's daily activities.  The song \"The Memory of Trees\" is like the arousal of a person from sleep, and greeting the morning sun or the welcoming of a spring rain.  The song sings of itself: a tree's memory of its youth.  Not ... only [do I]REALLY enjoy THIS song,  but I also enjoy the songs of \"Pax Deorum\", \"Althair Ar Neamh\", \"China Roses\", \"Hope Has a Place\", \"Tea House Moon\", and \"On My Way Home\".  This CD is absolutely relaxing, serene, and caliming to the tempestuous spirit.  I fall asleep with having visions as I am listening to this CD."}

{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought Flyleaf's CD over the weekend and just had to put up a comment about it.  I would not rate this CD my favorite that I have bought in the past year but I would certainly put it into the top, oh I don't know, 20.  It is a good CD having many good tracks on it, but listening to Fully Alive on the radio then buying the CD and listening to the entire CD, the CD was different than what I expected, so that could be altering my judgement on it.  There is a bit too much screaming on the first track and another on it, I don't remember which one.  Buy the CD because it is worth your money, just don't buy it because you really like Fully Alive because many of the songs on the CD are not like that song, they are a bit heavier than that.  A good CD overall and I will be buying their next CD coming out."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The CD itself is good, but not fantastic.  I just got back from seeing them play live, though, and whoa!  They played a small venue here and tore down the house.  They are extremely energetic, the music is crisp, and Lacey sounded (and looked) great.  I went because a friend of mine had an extra ticket, so I figured what the heck.  I was not disappointed.  The CD doesn't do the live show justice, and for that I give it 4 stars.  If they're coming to a place near you, though, definitely check them out."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like everyone else here, I heard \"I'm so sick\" on the radio and had to hear some more. Also like a lot of others, I agree that while \"I'm so sick\" is good, it's not Flyleaf's strongest song. There are suprises here that make you listen closely to every song, rather than losing strenth towards the end, like most CDs. Lacey has an unbelievable voice. Imagine the clarity of Avril Lavigne, the power of Christina Agulara, and the rapid pitch change of Kelly Clarkson, combined. But she's not just a combination of super singers, instead Lacey has a unique sound, very heartfelt, and at times even creepy.The musical part of the band is good too. A little on the slow side at times, and could definitely use some better drum work, but that can be left for future albums.I bought this CD based on one song, and wasn't disappointed. If you like hard rock, it's pretty hard not to like this."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am a huge fan of Evanesence and I stumbled upon this band. They are a definite rock band with a Christian twist but anyone can enjoy it. Cassie is probably the most religious of all the songs (talking about the girl at Columbine who answered \"yes\" if she believed in God so the shooters killed her). This is a great band and the singer reminds me of Amy Lee, except minus some of the lung power. I love most of the songs on here such as \"All Around Me\", \"I'm sorry\", \"I'm so sick\", and \"Cassie\". If you have heard any of Evanesence, this band sounds similar. I really enjoyed this CD and have listened to it a lot."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "MeTalHeaD4Ever \"DEath\" pretty much hit the nail on the head. This sounds like Avril Lavigne and Evanescence mixed together, which isn't a good thing! The grating vocals have already been described. The lyrics are generic, nu-metal tripe. Cristina Scabbia could kill this new girl in singing and songwriting. The guitar consists of power chords and no soloing. Why have 2 guitarists if they do the same thing?! The bassist might as well just quit, since you can't hear him. The drums aren't special either.All Tracks: 0/10Avoid this garbage, and get Lacuna Coil's new CD instead."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I picked this up because the local radio station, 897powerfm.com, plays some of this bands songs on the air.  I LOVE this entire CD!  What GREAT vocals and lyrics!  I am a new fan of this band and I look forward to picking up their EP and future releases.The best way that I can think of to describe them is Broomtree vocals with Tree 63 or Benjamin Gate tunes.  The lead singer's voice is incredible, I admit that I like the fact that a woman can yell like that.This one is going on my MP3 player and on my review forum at [...]"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am going to echo everyone who says that this cd hasn't left their player. Being someone that changes her cd every few songs it is rare for me to keep one cd replaying over and over. I love the combination of Lacey's sweet childlike voice mixed in with some well crafted hard rock notes. I had been going through  some down times in my life and this cd is just what I need. The lyrics and music really relate to my issues and help to find serenity in my faith. I recommend this everyone. A+"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "When a friend casually asked me to pull up the \"I'm So Sick\" video on Flyleaf's Myspace page, I was a bit bored and tired. After a few bars of the opening baseline, I was already interested. Then Lacey screamed \"I Will Break\" and I was instantly excited and considering purchasing the album.In short, Flyleaf's music packs energy, enthusiasm, and an air of honesty (the latter being rare in our overproduced era, especially among younger bands). When my girlfriend, Jen, and I had the opportunity to see Flyleaf perform and spend an hour on their tour bus, we found more of the same love and ambition. These individuals have a genuine desire to spread hope to a hungry generation.This album is heavy enough for when you want to rock, and beautiful enough to accompany meditation or even prayer. Be cautious, however, because some of these songs have been stuck in my head for weeks at a time."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Flyleaf has found quite a bit of success touring with bands like Deftones. Their lead singer is female, and she is tiny at that. But don't let that turn you off. This isn't another average girl fronted metal band, like Kittie. She is able to convey so much emotion into every song it is unbelievable. It is a very solid cd. No filler. I'm excited for their next one too, because I think they have tons more potential. I mean, they've already sold over 500,000 copies of this one, which is pretty darn good. I don't think that everyone will like them, though. But if you're looking for something different as far as vocals go, try them."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "It has been brought to my attention, by the people who left comments, that the review I wrote lacked good judgement and taste. It is one thing to say you don't like something, but to be rude and belligerent is wrong; nevertheless, I still do not like the band, and, therefore, I won't raise the amount of stars I gave at first, but  I do detract the words Appalling and vacuous.Fans of the band, please forgive me for being rude.The original review is below.The four and one half star rating of this album is beyond me.  The music is substandard, the singer, appalling, and the lyrics, vacuous! If you are looking for a female-fronted metal band, buy Tristania, Epica, After Forever, or Within Temptation.  This is a \"Fly leaf\" from a horrible book!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've been a Skillet fan for years, and they just keep impressing me more with each album.  \"Comatose\" is a great blend of driving, hard rock with quick (though constant) infusions of synth rhythms.What's most amazing about this album, however, is the lyrical intimacy the band achieves in the midst of such hard rock.  Songs like \"The Last Night\" and \"Yours to Hold\" contain some beautiful lyrics of love, but they're couched in the midst of the screaming guitars and driving rhythms.\"Rebirthing\" and \"Whispers in the Dark\" show off the band's hard rock edge, while \"Say Goodbye\" and \"Looking for Angels\" are excellent ballads.  Overall, another winner from this incredible band."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I haven't been able to stop listening to this cd for three days. it's got a very new sound to it,which is awesome. It's not bland or boring at all, unlike some cd's these days.

{"label": 6, "raw": "Skillets previous albums \"Alien Youth\" and \"Collide\" was very catchy and wellperformed records with lots of emotion ,heaviness and melody but with this they have really set a huge landmark in the world of alternative rock. \"Comatose\" is packed to the limit with huuuge choruses and emotional lyrics mixed with huge string arrangements and crunchy postgrunge guitars! The biggest surprise of the year?! Skillet is definetely nominated!! =)Wonder if their next record could be better.....hardly bigger anyway!! ;)Thumbs up guys!! (and girls)Highlights: Rebirting, The Last Night, Say Goodbye"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've been a pan-head since album 1 and I've really enjoyed seeing how skillet has evolved over the years.  This is an excellent and rocking album, first and foremost, and the talent is undeniable.  Anyone who's familiar with Skillet won't deny their passion for God and the human race that He loves, so if you're Christian, don't be put off just because you don't hear \"God\" or \"Jesus\" in the songs.  Without having to say the words, God is there.  This album touches on relationships, person to person and God to man.  It's about reaching out, being there for someone or needing someone to be there for you.  It's about figuring out the hard stuff, finding hope, finding life.  I'm very impressed by this album, musically and spiritually.  I can't believe it would be a disappointment to anyone.  Happy listening! :)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "To get straight to the point, Comatose is probably Skillet's best album ever. Without hearing anything on this record before buying it, I was completely convinced that there was no way Comatose could come close to comparing to \"Collide\" ~ which I thought was even better than the outstanding record \"Alien Youth.\" Comatose is packed from start to finish with songs you probably won't ever skip. The tracks just rock my face off. I would rate this album 6 stars if I could. Its that good."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I'll skip all the fancy jargon, and just say that this CD has FAR exceeded my expectations for the album. I've had every album Skillet has ever made, and overall this is my favorite. Glad they've brought a bit of keyboards back in on this one, and they let Ben run wild on guitar! Kid is talented. It's also got great lyrics that can appeal to the MTV crowd and still be uplifting and point to God. Do yourself a favor and buy the cd ASAP. This is the CD I'll be listening to for a month or so straight."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Most bands seem to peak with their first, second, maybe third album. Well, it took Skillet a decade (and I don't know how many albums later) to produce a truly great album. Here, finally, is the mature, creative, talented Skillet that's been waiting to bloom, separating them from the mass of mediocre Christian grunge-metal bands out there. Yes, this album is a little more polished and has greater pop-sensibility than their previous work, but it's entirely for the good. From beginning to end, this album does not disappoint. They truly should get mainstream play with this album. It's hard to pick favorite tracks, but I would point you to \"The Older I Get\" and \"Those Nights,\" plus, of course, the fantastic first single, \"Rebirthing.\""}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Pre-Script: This is the only Skillet I own and have ever heard (I'm a new fan) so I don't want to say this is their best work cause I'm not sure, however here's my review for \"Comatose\":My Review: Well, the songs have already been rated so I'll leave them out but this is definitely a must-buy. I think Skillet is doing a really great thing: spreading of my savior Jesus Christ through MY personal favorite type of music: HEAVY METAL! But one thing that should be added is that this CD has extrememely good sound quality. Like, I can;t explain besides excellent songs, the CD opens up with crystal clear audio on \"Rebirthing\" and throughout. It's like an HD-CD.GO SKILLET ANED BUY THIS CD!I also reccommend:Demon HunterToby MacUnderoath"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Let me start off by saying this album is absolutley amazing!!!! There are no fillers here. Every single song could be released as a single! I highly recommend this album to all lovers of Christian rock. This album defintley ties with there 2004 album \"Collide\" for there best album yet. Skillet is really the best christian rock band out there hands down! From the very moment you hear the first track and single \"Rebirthing,\" you'll be left absolutley speechless and amazed at how wonderful and breathtaking it is.  It will suddenly make a christian remember the first time they accepted Jesus Christ into there life as Lord and Savior, and became a new creation and are now living for love just as he did.So please do yourself a favor and buy this now! You won't be disappointed by any means!! Skillet continues to deliver great awesome Christian rock tunes with each album and this album continues that. BUY NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Even though I do enjoy most of the music Skillet puts out, I wouldn't exactly call myself a 'panhead'. However, with the release of \"Comatose\" I am one step closer to becoming a 'pan-head'. This album is a true work of art. I admire the way they sing with so much passion. Their lyrics are thought-provoking and strike right at the listener's heart. The music (guitar riffs included) keep you drawn in.Some of my favorite songs from the album are: Rebirthing, Comatose, The Last Night, Yours to Hold, The Older I Get, Those Nights, Say Goodbye and Whispers in the Dark.I highly recommend this album if you want to listen to some down to earth Christian rock!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I thought that 'Arriving' by Chris Tomlin was great.  This one is even better.This artist is pretty much in a class by himself when it comes to praise and worship music.  This album is packed with songs that sound great, have Christ centered lyrics, and are also songs that churches can sing in their services.  Very few can pull that combination off like Tomlin does.Here are some of the best tracks:  How Can I Keep From Singing, Made To Worship, Let God Arise, Glory In The Highest, Awesome Is the Lord Most High, Everlasting God,  and Amazing Grace.I highly recommend this for anyone who loves great worship music."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "King Crimson uses part of the rock language ( with the instrumentation ) but adds something extra that makes the listener uneasy . The music is similar to their first album in that there are heavy songs put together with much lighter toned ones .Though I like the album a lot , it's not one I listen to for pleasure . If you were driving at night and were lost , this would not be the music to have playing .Beacuse a lot of the music is instrumental , the listener can conjure up mental images .It is intense and I recommend you hear it first before buying ."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Even though this album really only has three songs I liked on it, it still gets 4 stars. Robert Fripp just lets it go crazy on Lark's Tongue Part 1, Book of Saturday, not bad future Asia's John Wenton, bass and vocals on that track. I think they might have been competing with Floyd on Easy Money, still an awesome track by these guys. So three out of six ain't bad, I don't think considering it's progressive, so you have to sit thru long sets, but the songs I liked that I mentioned in this review aren't too long, so you'll live. This album I would only recommend to people though who do like progressive rock in the fact that some of the delicate types might not quite grip the concept, enjoy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Welcome to KC, Mr. Bruford and Mr. Muir! The sometimes harsh percussion excursions on this album make for a truly unique experience. This album stands alone in the entire catalogue of KC material. Nowhere else is the use of percussion so thouroughly investigated than on &quot;Larks' Tongues in Aspic.&quot; From the maddening shifts in ferocity in the title track to the Pink Floyd-ish &quot;Easy Money&quot;, the two percussionists take center stage. I truly wish that Jamie Muir would've stayed on just a bit longer with KC; the material on &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; seem eerily empty without his presence. Later in KC's exitence, when Pat Mostello joined the soon to depart Bill Bruford on drums (the &quot;Thrak&quot; LP), it seemed that indeed the members themselves yearned for the tight percussives of &quot;LTIA.&quot; The effort was too little, too late.Regardless, this album is possibly one of the best of the KC output. It is a must have."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The little chime sound you hear at the beginning is a kalimba, an african thumb piano. After being hypnotized by this you will then hear a very well played, quiet, fluttering violin (the sound of lark's tongues?)Don't turn  the volume up too loud here, because you will split your speakers when the  crescendo of acid guitars come wailing into your brain. This is music of a  sort you haven't heard, a classic example of acid rock, classical mixed  with rock, and some sophisticated noisy percussion and jazz thrown in. Hey,  relax, thats just the first track."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I am listening to it right now. KC doesn't compromise. They are the Wagner of rock.Buy this and the complete King Crimson catalogue. If you don't like it, one of your grandkids will. Like lots of great music, King Crimson isn't appropriately revered in its time. One day, you'll be able to walk into any bar and there will always be least one Crimhead in the room.Music is my life. The music I am most passionate about is King Crimson.KC forever!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "With completely new personnel (aside from founding member Robert Fripp), a new lyricist and a new attitude, King Crimson returned with a vengeance on this, their fifth U.S. album. Adopting a heavier, more streamlined approach, the Fripp/Wetton/Bruford/Cross/Muir line-up sizzles like a volcano ready to explode. Gone are the gentle cellos and woodwinds of the previous LP, Islands - replaced with Cross' searing violin, Muir's eccentric purcussion and Fripp sounding heavier than ever on guitar. The mellotron is understated, while Wetton's bass thunders and Bruford manages the syncopated arrangements beautifully on drums. Highlights include the title cut (parts one and two), Exiles and the plaintive Book Of Saturdays. This album is considered the strongest post-In The Court Of The Crimson King album by the band (and really can't be compared to that album, as this is basically a completely different band - with similarities in name only)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Simply, one of the top prog records of all time.  Hard to get into at first, but every listen penetrates your soul until you get fully addicted to one of the most gifted and original rocK groups of all time.  Specially  interesting to guitarrists, bassists and drummers. This line up can hardly  be any better in creativity and chops. Also recommended: Red, Starless and  Bible Black, and Discipline studio Cd's.  There is also a recent wonderful  live compilation called Cirkus."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This album is a treasure mostly because the sound is unique to anything you will hear. No other artist will be able to imitate this sound, and even this very band, in any other lineup, couldn't imitate the sound. And it is definitely a cool sound.This is a great album to introduce yourself to King Crimson. The sound is very accessible, but remaining extremely experimental and artistic.The whole thing has a very dark and sinister tone to it, which definitely adds to the value of the music in my opinion.The album definitely isn't for everyone, and may put you in a weird mood if you listen to it too many times, or for too long, but I cannot deny that this is a class album.Also, don't judge the album solely by the samples that are provided on any website. :)The songs change quite a bit throughout."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "OK, Here's the rundown - LTiA1 is pretty cool, although it runs a bit too long in my opinion.  Book of Saturday is an agreeable little tune with very nice vocals.  Exiles will remind you of the first couple o' KC  albums.Easy Money is similar to &quot;Cat Food&quot; and &quot;Ladies of  the Road,&quot;  The Talking Drum is pretty much a complete waste of space,  and finally LTiA2 is one of the best rock and roll tunes in exsitence and  is pretty much worth the price of the CD alone.&quot;Red&quot;,  &quot;Discipline&quot;, and &quot;The ConstruKction of Light&quot; are all  better KC CD's, but if you're a fan this is definitely worth the purchase."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is one of King Crimson's classic albums from the 70's that included BillBruford from Yes and John Wetton who played for Family and Uriah Heep. I gotreally interested in King Crimson during my early college years, and had comeacross their double album \"A Young Person's Guide to King Crimson\" from 1976.The first two tracks, Larks' Tongue in Aspic, and Book of Saturday, are on thealbum,and really liked them. I therefore went and got the album and really likedit from beginning to end. And being a fan of John Wetton, it goes well withUriah Heep's Return to Fantasy. One of the most underrated bands of all timeand should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "After listening to &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; which i thought was very good and had many beautiful moments, i was disappointed by Larks in that overall it sounded very dry and dull.  I fail to see what KC was trying to do when they recorded this album.  I wish they would have said something about that in the newspaper clippings in the albums liner notes.  Until i hear something about their purpose behind this album  i cannot apreciate this album from the standpoint of a music fan, there is just no emotion like there is in a Yes or Beatles recording.  &quot;Book of Saturdays&quot; is an ok song and &quot;Larks..pt.1&quot; is slightly interesting, but other than that i'm sorry i got this cd."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The second great version of King Crimson.  They came out of the box strong here, all members contributing brilliantly in some relatively equivalent proportion.  Robert Fripp has characterized his intention on some of the pieces as wanting to combine the passion you hear in African-American music and in Jimi Hendrix with aspects of the European tradition (precision and symmetry in composition) ala Stravinsky - he and the band actually did that here.  Music doesn't get much better than this.Larks' Tongue 1 &amp; 2, and Easy Money, fit the bill I've just described.  They are crafted, played, and recorded brilliantly.  &quot;Talking Drum&quot; is an effective jam, a study in rhythm and dissonance.  &quot;Book of Saturdays&quot; and &quot;Exiles&quot; are vocal ballads - I can actually live without them.  But that doesn't diminish the album, which is a real undereheard classic."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The title of this review is a slight exaggeration, but nevertheless this album has a classical element to it. Violins take center stage here, and permeate throughout. This album is definitely an acquired taste; the songs have very complex structures and have to build momentum. In many ways, this album is very bold, in the form of being very different. The standout tracks are EXILES and LARKS TONGUES IN ASPIC PART 2. EASY MONEY is good too, and features great bass work. I recommend this album for those who want a very progressive sound, and appreciate something totally outside the box. The violin really carries this album. The second half of the album is unexpectedly heavier than the first half."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Like the other Crimson reissues, this hits the mark perfectly. There really isn't more you could ask for. You get a remixed album, bonus tracks, original mix, DVD-Audio, audio DVD-Video and video. Again, the content on the DVD seems to go on forever and I still haven't finished exploring.  Having both formats is good because almost no-one has DVD-Audio, although it's obviously great if you do - I don't, sadly. Steve Wilson does a great job with this project, an album often upheld as the band's finest hour.  I like many of the early albums but I also get why it's so esteemed.  First impressions of the 5.1 mix are that it's fantastic, although I know that this is a matter of opinion in most cases. Crimson fans need it, casual listeners should get a single disc version."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Here on CD we have the \"legendary\" album by William Shatner.  You may have heard his ridiculous renditions of \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\" and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" on theGolden Throatsalbum.  Actually, both of those songs are excerpts of medleys, with \"Lucy\" being paired with a monologue fromCyrano de Bergerac, and \"Tambourine Man\" being paired with an obscure poem called \"Spleen\".  See, the idea was to show Shatner's acting range by having him play two different emotions on the same track.  Of course, this being Bill Shatner, he overacts every emotion.  This is a terrible album, but it is the Holy Grail for collectors of bad celebrity recordings."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I love this album, but from a purely technical perspective I have to admit it lies somewhere in between spoken word, a vegas cover act, and torture. It's awful, but hysterically awful.Shatner can't sing either. However, like Plan 9 from Outer Space, it's so nonsensical, it borders on great. I mean really, who thought setting up the theme from Cyrano and Mr. Tambourine Man as a medley was a good idea? His Mr. Tambourine Man is the most hysterically awful cover. Ever. The arrangement sounds like Mr. Tambourine Man does broadway, constipated.Spend the dollar."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "What can I say about this delightfully horrible recording that hasn't already been said? Shatner's ridiculously overdone Shakespearean soliloquies, paired with old pop standards that he talks through (rather than actually sings), is one of the greatest &amp; most famous `goof' albums ever made! It's truly bad, yet you just can't help but listen! My two faves are his covers of `Mr. Tambourine Man' and `Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds'. In both of these, he sounds like he's comin' down off of some really bad trips (which I believe was the idea in the first place!). Just cue this up at your next big Trekkie eppie marathon and let `er roll!`Late"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I found this DVD very inspirational in terms of motivating students of ballet to really work hard and strive for perfection.  It was interesting and informative to see how the Russian students were picked and what happens to them in their schooling, up to a final performance where they are seen by the public and how they later become successful dancers.  There is a wonderful segment showing the older student and how she learns old choreography from an older former great Russian ballerina, like it is handed down reverently from generation to generation.  I loved the dancing of these students, as well as the joy they showed in their training."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this dvd to see the principals perform one of my favorite ballets and I was not disappointed, much. Both Ananiashvili and Fadeyetchev give wonderful and accurate performances.  This version is pretty much a traditional one, with most of Petipa's ideas.  I was a little disappointed that there was not much very new, exciting, and technically challenging, as one should expect at this point in ballet history.  The prince does not dance much in the first act, but they have given him a new solo adagio, which was refreshing.  Another refreshment is the fourth act which uses some music that is often cut out.  All the acts are a nice full length.  Aside for the sedate principal dancer's choreography, everything else is well done:  the costumes, sets, group choreography, and the character dancing.  Maybe this would not be my first choice in traditional Swan Lakes, but if you have a collection, as I do, this should find a place in it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "All that I might have said has been well presented by those who ranked this performance two or three stars. I am sellling off my copy of this Royal Ballet DVD - not that it's a bad production at all but that it is over-rated and rather bland.I highly recommend the performance by the Swedish Ballet as a first choice keeper.Tchaikovsky: Swan LakeIt is gripping it its drama, the sets establish a mood but do not call attention to themselves, and the emotional commitment of everyone involved is clearly profound.  And oh yes, the dancing and the acting (it is a story ballet, after all) are superb, and the orchestral playing if not better in execution is certainly better in recorded sound."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Amazing live performances captured on film are the reason to see to see this.The interviews with Janis don't reveal much, and there's no real sense of her history. Even the stage stuff is shot pretty straightforwardly, but, man-o-man could she sing!One wonderful thing is that a lot of the numbers are uncut, allowed to go their full length, which, with Janis in concert, could easily be 8 minutes or more. The power, the emotion, the energy, the sexiness, the sweet sense of fun she brought to the stage could only be hinted at on her albums. For those reasons it's more than worth sitting through the slightly homogenized off-stage material.It awful to think that this is essentially unavailable.  Time for a decent DVD re-release!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Good show from Tom and the boys (and girls).  The video itself is dark but it is 25 years old.  It's still very entertaining.  Also very nice to watch a concert video where they film the band much more than the crowd.  I don't buy concert videos to watch the crowds.  Besides the darkness I only have two other complaints, having a pre-teen and a teen I could do without the off-color word used a few times (f---).  Number 2 why do they have to roll the ending credits over the last song?  Couldn't they have waited until the concert was over?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "As a life-long TP fan, with reservations regarding some of the slightly obvious material, I bought this video when it came out.  Then lost it so some git who borrowed it and didn't return it.  Hard to get another copy in the UK, but it seems it is still around in the States.  It's kind of curious to watch a concert which occured before half the material played live these days was written - pre Wilburys, pre Full Moon Fever, pre Wildflowers.  Consequently it's a concert that Stan Lynch would presumably have approved of - Tp &amp; The H at their goodtime jangling finest.  It's as good as I remembered it, and my memory of it is the reason I've spent the last 10 years looking out for a new copy. Either it's very good or I'm an anorak.  Take your pick...."}

It was recorded in the mid-1980's, so Buffett's newer stuff is not included.  However, most  of the songs that have made Jimmy Buffett a household name are included.

I used to be a total Deadhead. I saw them 587 times in concert.The only thing missing for me in this movie that I used to see during the actual concerts is the 30 foot tall talking turtle that used to sit next to me at most of the shows. That dude was awesome! He'd sit there and tell me stories about life in Giant Turtle Land and then he'd play air guitar along with Jerry's real guitar playing. Giant Turtle Guy was the best!Anyway, if you love the Dead, you'll totally love this movie. Get it and get a Grateful groove on..."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "There are a couple of good reviews on Amazon about this DVD already, so I'm going to try to keep this short. First off, this is a great DVD (both of them). The footage is terrific- showing many aspects of a Dead concert.But this DVD is more than just conert footage. By the end the viewer can almost feel the temperature of the place, the work and hours that went into building the stage, long hours on the road, and the flat out soul the Dead brought to the fans... and vice versa.I would suggest watching this DVD, the reading Mr. Lesh's book and then watching this again."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I cannot express in words how awesome this dvd set is. They did an excellent job with it in every way. The sound will blow you away, especially if you have a 5.1 system (you don't need it, there is a regular stereo sound option too) but the surround sound is insane.The extras are all top notch - stuff you actually want to watch. I have to say that this is probably the best music DVD purchase I have ever made - the content, the packaging the little booklet - it's all of the highest quality. Very highly recommended!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Deuter: try the soundtrack for the tunes cut short by the movie..five discs have all the movie stuff plus all the extra's.The movie itself is awesome. I've been waiting for years...my Laserdisc version holding me over until this fabulous release. The remaster with the improved sound is excellent and the extra stuff is a great bonus. David Lemieux (dead archivist) promises that they'll be more to come from this set of historic '74 Winterland \"farewell\" shows.P.S., the Dead wanted to document the ENTIRE Dead Head concert experience so all the audience coverage was deemed necessary as it aint a show without the Heads!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The Grateful Dead Movie is a two-disc DVD showcasing the famous rock-and-roll band. Disc 1 (132 minutes) offers the movie itself, transferred from its original 35 mm film negative in High Definition and presented in 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio. Audio options include the original theatrical audio mix and new Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 audio mixes from the master multi-track tapes. A feature-length commentary with supervising editor Susan Crutcher and film editor John Nutt as well as English subtitles offer an additional extra dimension over VHS copies. Disc 2 (175 minutes) is packed with extensive never-before-seen concert footage, bonus songs, a \"making of the animated sequence\" documentary, a photo gallery, production notes, and more. An absolute must-have for Grateful Dead fans, filled to the brim with excitement, majesty, and thrilling music."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought it on ebay auction and have watched it like four times in the last few days. the second disc is incredible too! i think the songs on the bonus disc are even better than the ones from the original movie! the second disc also has a couple of neat documentaries you may dig. this dvd was rare and overpriced for awhile. looks like price has recently dropped (copies selling at a little over $10)so if you love g.d. and you don't already have it, get it! BTW, why are there so many Donna Godchaux haters out there? She's not the prettiest bird, but she's definitely a sexy lady!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "my man, Norman, turned me on to the Dead. we have this movie and it is sooooo cool! if you are a fan, you must have it!Jerry produced this and made it, hired cameramen etc. and did it. shows back stage stuff, set up, the concerts, the hippies and fans in the crowd. experience a Dead concert - watch this movie - 'cause you sure can't go see the Dead in concert like this anymore. (Jerry is gone, sniff)a real cool experience - for sure. Dead-heads - buy it. curious? buy it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The MET opera's previous production of Ballo, set in colonial America was premiered and recorded in 1980. Both Luciano Pavarotti and Katia Ricciarelli were at the height of their vocal powers and it shows. Pavarotti's love for the score translates well to the screen, even though he may not be the most imaginative actor around. Ricciarelli is even more effective as Amelia; as a singing actress of the highest order, her interpretation is both strong voiced and well acted. Louis Quilico as Renato is in good voice and Judith Blegen is a dashing Oscar. Bianca Berini is a bit of a low point as Ulrica, not eclipsing Florence Quivar in the subsequent MET recording. Patane's conducting is often at odds with his lead singers and the camera focus could be better at times, but this is a fantastic opportunity to see and hear both Pavarotti and Ricciarelli in their prime."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "this is an old movie starring animated farm animals in which this little girl plays with wilbur the pig a lot.what she doesnt know is todays porkbelly pigpen playmate is tomorrows barbeque.the spider likes wilbur too,so she spins messages of praise to wilbur for all to see.everyone gets in a uproar over this fascinating phenomenon and they hope to save wilbur this way.kids like it but theres a dead charlotte at the end so the emotional ones will be in teers.it is very much consistent with the book.my 4th grade teacher read it to us.its good too.the author e.b. white also wrote the trumpets of the swan and stuart little also.the message here is dont hold onto nothing for too long.especialy a big fat farm pig filled with pork chops and bacon.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  mmmm."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Everything is wrong in the disaster as all the charm, sadness and drama of this classic is gone. Charlotte should be a hairy spider with a Lucille LaVerne type voice, not a gorgeous arachnid with Miss Reynold's soothing tones. This is a story of friendship and self-sacrifice which is totally missing. And the tragic death of Charlotte, which is the highlight of the story, is simply glossed over. Along with The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch , Charlotte's Web is one of a trio of worst children's films of all time."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "All I can say is casting Paul Lynde as Templeton the rat was a stroke of genius. Can you say *C*A*M*P* Boys and Girls?But the queeny sub-text will escape the intended audience, so not to worry Mom and Dad.E. B. White would probably object to most of the changes made here, but compared to the execrable and unconscionable changes made to his \"Stuart Little\" it is not even comparable and sticks somewhat to the original text.However, I strongly recommend that this story be reserved for five to seven year olds, for the theme of death of a loved one from the perspective of an innocent may be too much to bear for younger viewers.But if you can avoid watching this until you've read the original E. B. White story to your children you will have given them a treasure of memorable American narrative prose."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "for whatever reason with CHARLOTTES WEB it hasen't been digitally restored.this movie is just as good as any disney movie.but hasn't got the same treatment as one of their animated features,i don't knowwhy.i normally prefer the widesgreen versions of most movies but in the case of this original classic i believe the full screen is better its clearer and brighter.so until this movie gets a well deserved digital clen up full screen it is. the movie is as wonderful as ever great story for children of all ages.great music and a wonerful family film. the original classic dates back to 1972 but surpasses the 2006 live action nick remake."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is E.B. White's classic and timeless children's story in animation and music.  Charlotte the Spider (Debbie Reynolds voice) teaches Wilbur the Pig (Henry Gibson's voice) about life, and Templeton the Rat (Paul Lynde's voice)all join in the barnyard fun for lessons in friendship, trust, and love.  A marvelous film for the entire family.  It's a throwback to another age, this movie, and we all can learn something from a more quieter life, although in animation, it seems like the animals are just like us.  Or is it the other way around.  In any event, it's a fun film."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Wilbur, the pig, is the loveable main character in this animated film based on the classic children's novel.  Newborn runt, Wilbur, is saved from certain death by farm girl Fern, but it is really Charlotte, the spider, who becomes his friend and ensures he will live a long life. A year in the life of a pig and a spider was never so entertaining or sentimental as in this movie.This is a great movie that both you and your children can enjoy.  There are some nice songs and the action is true to the book.  Henry Gibson is sweet as Wilbur, Debbie Reynolds is a no-nonsense Charlotte, and Paul Lynde is very funny as Templeton the rat.  A fun movie about the true meaning of friendship."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is not a Disney cartoon so the look is different.  But the level of animation is fine and isn't even noticeable because the video itself is so good.The story, song, and voice talents are extraordinary and this film easily gets 5 stars.  Any cartoon that has Debbie Reynolds, Paul Lynde, Henry Gibson, Dave Madden, Danny Bonaduce, and Agnes Moorehead has got to be top notch.  The music is also well done.  And of course the story from E. B. White is one of the classics.Kids and adults alike watch and rewatch this in my home and I recommend it highly for your video library.  Nothing objectionable at all in the film.  Enjoy!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "CHARLOTTE'S WEB is a family oriented and delightful adaptation of E.B. White's children's classic.  A rare venture by the Hanna Barbera team into full length movies, the film benefits from its rich colorizations and cartoon-like drawings.  We meet all the loveable characters:  the runt Wilbur (Henry Gibson), the pig who enlists the spider's aid in avoiding the bacon farm; Charlotte herself (a winsome Debbie Reynolds), a spider who spins words into her web to ensure Wilbur's existence; the ravenous mouse Templeton (Paul Lynde), who becomes Charlotte's aide, in coming up with the right words; and countless others, including a dotty Agnes Moorehead as the triple speaking goose.  The songs by Oscar winning Sherman Brothers (Mary Poppins) are banal and forgettable (with the exception of the lyrical \"Charlotte's Web), but they don't offend the viewer too badly.  All in all, a delightfully entertaining film for the whole family to share."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Okay, all right, sorry if I had to *slam* such an wonderful, endearing classic (which it happens to be, for the record, so no sarcasm intended here), but what I don't get or understand is how Paramount could push something like this WITHOUT any bonus features (commentaries, behind-the-scenes info, and so on). I even once read where Debbie Reynolds said it took her two to three days for her to record the voice of Charlotte.Ever since 1973 (when CW first came out), children's TV/movies have taken nothing but a severe nose-dive, to the point where all you see nowadays is TOTAL CRAP.  Who cares how Saturday morning-ish CW was, in terms of animation and the voice cast?  All it shows is the versatility of both put out by Hanna-Barbera; there are probably those of us who don't seem to realize how good we had it then!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I recently went rug shopping for my new house.  I got bored and let my mom and aunt do the rest.  So I went to the movie corner and other than this, was not able to find any thing that wasn't disney, wee sing, or barney.  But this was the top.  It was full of songs, animation, and music, which held interest not only of children, but of adults as well.  I'm nineteen years old and discovered it when I was 4.Charlotte was spoken by Debbie Reynolds.  She played Cathy in &quot;Singing in the Rain.&quot;  I began to wish Debbie was in the room with me.  I want to meet her someday.I hope that Paramount pictures decides to do a drama re-make of it like they did of Stuart Little.Enjoy!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The singing is great, with Scotto at top. Scotto acts as I've never seen her before and Domingo isn't bad in that either.  Levine's orchestral work is the best of his that I've heard.  The camera work is excellent too, with  almost flawless composition.But what sets this opera apart is the  passion and emotion binding these elements and its principals together,  rendering it much more than the sum of its parts.Yes, I thought that in  Act I they hadn't really gotten into yet, I wouldn't have minded a bit more  lushness from the orchestra, and the VHS sound is definitely no CD, but no  matter for a performance like this."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "If you've seen Motley Crue's \"Uncensored\", it's somewhat similar to this one. \"Konfidential\", \"Unplugged\" and \"Kiss My A**\" should also be picked up. So far the footage alone makes this one worth getting over the others. If you loved the 80s era KISS along with seeing some vintage clips, this one's the one you want to pick up.I would love to see them put out a full length blown out video collection from over the years worthy of being a companion to the KISS box set including the original 4 playing the songs from \"Alive\" and \"Destroyer\" from beginning to end."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "...the rest is really just Paul and Gene mugging into the camera.  This is truly the era of KISS where Paul and Gene felt that the make-up days were the past and the present was where it was at.  Fast forward to 1995.....the make-up was where the $$$ was.If you want a pretty good compilation of KISS videos then this is a good buy.  That's about it.  The \"interviews\" with Gene and Paul are arrogant and insincere.  They both take verbal shots at Ace and Peter for no good reason.This DVD is just average.  When will they just start putting full concerts on CD/DVD?"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I bought this video when it first came out in the 80's when I was in high school. At the time, it was the closest thing I could do to actually getting my heros in my house. I had/have all their albums - both the 70's, 80 and now 90's.Other people have talked about what's on it, and if you are a fan, it's a MUST. The only reason why it doesn't get a 5/5 star review is because of the serious lack of extras. Call me spoiled, but why couldn't KISS at least do a audio commentary?! How about bloopers? Anything?! It's just such a disappointment when other bands put out great DVDs that you can tell go the extra mile for their fans (ie: Def Leppard, Sum 41, etc...)"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I've seen it, and I like it.  The tunes are great, and this sort of thing was what every kid who picked up a guitar in the 80s dreamed of (fame, money, girls...okay, mostly girls, and lots of them.)  My only real problem  stems from one thing:  Why weren't Eric and Bruce allowed to have a little  more camera time?  I think they were in the thing for a grand total of 3  minutes.  the other 80+ seemed to be devoted to Gene &amp; Paul being  silly.  Good shot, but not quite a bull's-eye."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "KISS EXPOSED is hilariously funny! Gene and Paul give funny interviews throughout, and the videos are awesome! The half-naked girls through the video are expected in a lifestyle like this, and even the reporter gets a little involved at one point!  My favorite videos from it are \"Lick It Up,\" \"Tears are Falling,\" and \"Heaven's On Fire.\" It was interesting seeing the temporary guitar players, Vinnie Vincent and Mark St. John. I was rather disappointed that they hardly focused on Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick. Simmons and Stanley provide almost all the talking in this video, and discuss the band's history as well as crack jokes and do all kinds of things to annoy the camera crew! It love it when Stanley puts Root Beer in his Bran Flakes!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "At least this release has a semblance of production to it.The greatest moments are the Classic KISS footage, and not the throw away non-makeup material. It has taken KISS 20 years to realise that the best and most lucrative material is the out and out concert footage, with all of the blasting phantasmagoria that is the original KISS.This video comes close to that original fantasy in some of the scripted material, but falls flat on oh too many ways, however, just before it goes through the floor, it gets rescued by another classic clip.There definitely should have been more of Eric Carr in the Video, but not of Bruce Kulick. However, the original is still the best, and that footage is why I give this disc 5 stars. Unfortunately it would still be better in the bootleg version, but its nice to have the Authorised version. Pity they cannot do more releases of the Classic and Re-united KISS ( However short lived that fabulous fanatasy was)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This concert was filmed during Priest's 1986 Fuel For Life Tour in support of their &#34;Turbo&#34; album.  That album is certainly more commercial than nearly anything Priest had done before that time and that turned off a lot of die-hard fans.  However, according to the large crowd of fans shown on this video, that did not keep the fans away from catching the Metal Gods live.  The concert is a lot of fun to watch and a great snapshot of what it was like to attend a heavy metal concert in the mid-1980's.  You get the poofy hair, explosions, high energy, giant robot, and, of course, great tunes.  The band seem to be having a great time playing and the fans obviously love it.  They play a good mix of older songs and newer songs.  This may not be the definitive Priest concert film to watch but it is certainly a lot of fun."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "David Gilmour shines in this wonderfully produced and filmed live concert.  Every song is special.  If you like Pink Floyd or just good guitar, this is a must buy.  The extras are also quite spectacular.  Hearing David sing a Shakespeare poem was a real treat.  The home movies really give you insight into his life and music.  Oustanding!  Then, of course, there are the funny bits!  Like when Bob Geldolf can't remember the words for Comfortably Numb and has to read them off of paper!  OMG!  He really needed paper!  Thankfully, that was an extra and not part of the main concert footage.  Buy and enjoy."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Today is my 50th birthday and I treated myself to a great show of David Gilmour. Yeah, I'm getting older and so is David. But I'm so tired of my Pink Floyd CDs, and this great DVD allows both myself and Floyd to age gracefully. These versions are actually fresh to hear and to see. And the biggest treat for me was when David brought fellow Pink Floyd member Richard Wright up on the stage to sing a beautiful version of his song Breakthrough from his Broken China CD of 1996. So far as I know this is Rick's only performance of his solo work. Too bad! But at least we have this one song to cherish. And also along for the show: Floyd saxophonist Dick Parry. It's just Gilmour and Parry opening the show with a spare but beautiful Shine On You Crazy Diamond. It's a wonderfully intimate show, beautifully filmed and recorded. Every Floyd fan should have this."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Acoustic Pink Floyd?!  Is it worth it?To a large degree, yes.  Gilmour plays a rather intimate show featuring some Floyd, some solo work, a couple of Syd Barrett's tunes, a cover or two or three, and a surprisingly good song from guest Richard Wright.  Excellent 5.1 sound and a few bonus features.It may not satisfy all of the Pink Floyd fans chomping at the bit for &quot;Pulse&quot; to be released on DVD (AND JUST WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THAT?!  GET ON THE BALL, WHOEVER YOU GUYS ARE!), but it is an interesting and satisfying consolation prize for the rest of us."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "First -  I love David Gilmour...and believe he was more the 'sound' of Pink Floyd than Roger.  Upon reading reviews of this DVD \"David Gilmour in Concert 2002\", I bought it over the more expensive Royal Albert Hall DVD.  Mistake.  This one, though a quality performance, is not \"Pink Floyd re-visited\" and has ZERO songs from his first two solid albums from back in the 80s (David Gilmour and About Face).  It is a bunch of slow, 'On an Island' type songs from I don't know where and multiple versions of PF songs that all began to sound the same...  I had to fast forward several times.  The redeeming feature of this DVD is the Extras.  The DVD is 'only' $10, but I don't see myself ever watching it again so...not worth the money."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "...and this dvd prove it. Classics songs, an amazing good taste in selecting and performing those songs, which are in the heart of many ..Gilmour have the charisma of those who have everything clear....Of course, tracks like Confortably Numb (one of the 10 songs i loved more) and Wish you Were Here doesn't need too many words, but check out for the MARVELLOUS version of \"Don't\" and the SUBLIMEEEEEE!! \"Sonnet 18\"....This DVD deserves of all the attention. Don't miss it, please, and you'll be a happier person..."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I know I am gonna offend a lot of Gilmore fans, but let's face it, Roger Waters at least has been keeping physcially fit.  The first thing that came to mind when I viewed this was, \"Gilmore has really let himself go.\"  It looks like he has spent his free time eating donuts, ice cream, pasta and McDonalds.  And to add insult to injury, he plays wearing an old shabby t-shirt.I mean, if you are bloated and overweight, try to at least compensate and put on a decent shirt.  It is painful looking at his grimace through his fat face.  David, I respect your talents as a guitar God, but please get in shape or your gonna die early and not fully appreciate what you have accomplished in life."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I remember this concert well...but as they say of the '60s, if your can remember it you weren't there. I was a teen back then (September 1981) and like most of the hundreds of thousands of others there I was smoking myself a \"J\". Me and a friend got a good place as everyone packed in hours before the show. Then I had to take a leak. Unfortunately it took an hour of stepping over a mass of stoned people to find somewhere to go, and as the concert started I gradually found my way back.Mrs. Robinson starts it off. Then Homeward Bound, America, Me and Julio, Scarborough Fair, April Come She Will, Still Crazy, Late in the Evening, and it ends with Old Friends, Bookends, Sounds of Silence, and everything in between.It was a true musical happening."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "88min DVD containing the famous concert on Central Park featuring the one-night reunion of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. The concert looks and sounds good on this DVD. Even the John Lennon song where an angry fan rushed the stage is included. Also included in this DVD are some movie trailers which include: Carmen Jones, Carousel, Hello Dolly!, The King & I, Moulin Rouge!, Oklahoma!, and South Pacific. Additionally, there is English subtitles. Nice concert DVD for S&G fans inspite of Garfunkel looking a bit uncomfortable during the concert."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "The other 4 and 5 star reviews speak for themselves.  I'd like to correct a few misconceptions about this DVD, though.  Anyone who thinks that &quot;The Late Great Johnny Ace&quot; in not included on the DVD has not watched it all the way through.  Although not listed on the tacklist, it comes on right after &quot;A Heart In New York&quot;.  Another criticism was over the inclusion of seven Paul Simon solo tunes.  Paul Simon wrote almost all of S&amp;G's material.  In my book, any Paul Simon song that Art sings on is a S&amp;G song.  By that standard, there are only two Paul Simon solo songs.  Plus Art sings solo on two S&amp;G songs and his own &quot;A Heart In New York&quot;.  So I think it evens out pretty well."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A magic concert that needs to be seen by all, not just S&G; fans.  If you already own the album of this, then buy it as an accompanying piece.Thankfully the Australian DVD has been given a 5.1 surround sound mix as well.  But it is important to note that it is only simulated which means it is a pseudo surround sound.  Obviously the concert was originally only recorded in 2 channel stereo.  In 1981, that may have been the only option.A long awaited DVD anyway!"}

{"label": 6, "raw": "The more I listen to Zeppelin, the more I see the brilliance of each performer.  However, if one has to shine the brightest, unfortunately he also fell the soonest.  There have been many great drummers - Pert from Rush, Grohl from Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Them Crooked Vultures (with John Paul Jones) to name just two- but in the history of rock and roll and even other genres, there has been few that can play the drums not only as a rhythm instrument, but as an instrument in its own right.  Bonham added so much to this group that it is completely appropriate to that they broke up after his death.  Nothing against Page, Jones or Plant - they are all incredible musicians in their own right - but Bonham is the clear star of this group.  Not just in shear talent but in musicality.  He was able to add to any piece not just with technical brilliance.  He knew exactly what each piece needed to make it perfect."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I made the mistake of buying the newest DVD before this one.  There is no comparison.  I was used to hearing these tracks from the album of the same name, and the movie format it is unedited, usually a good thing.  But I found the sound track fading in and out at the most inopportune times.  No Quarter from the album has the most riveting organ and guitar solo, but it must have been filmed on a different night for the film, because it is shorter and lacks bravado.  Yes, the fantasy sequences are a bit dated and cheesy but that comes with the territory of the film and when it was made.  Overall it is still good but nothing compares to the newest DVD for live musical content.A must for any Zep fan to have."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A nice collectible concert for living in the past as the song remains the same. Video transfer quality is ok considering the film is about 35 years old. Audio quality has been greatly improved and makes this title worthwhile for Zeppelin fans. This DVD replaced my VHS copy of the movie. The extras are also ok, nothing to get too excited about. If you are expecting the concert to look as good as modern day 16:9 standard DVD's let alone HD DVD's you will be disappointed. A must have for serious collectors as HD is being discontinued.  I give this release four flaming chilies as it is Led Zeppelin after all."}

Bonham's moby dick is just incrediable, and John Paul John's keyboard, and bass playing is smoothe.

(for a change, not all the sound comes from the center channel, its mixed beautifully). There are very cool new stage edits not, for some reason, in the original cut. It was actually shot very well, just edited poorly (the original cut) Now I can safely say it is one of the best concerts film outs there! The 'fantasy' sequences are still dumb, but it was a sign of the times...You see why, if you never saw them, why they are still so popular!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Outstanding. The \"Rockumentary\" shows the footage from Led Zeppelin's concert in New York city as well as a bit from their personal lives.The viewer gets an idea of what it's like from their end of the tour as well as some of the most outstanding music ever in concert.Most noteworthy is the drum solo from \"Moby Dick\" from the late John Bonham.It is long,but anything but boring.Overall,this is evidence of why their will never again be quite a decade like the 1970s for music."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was glad to see that this movie was released on DVD. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the lack of extra's, the only difference is the trailer, other than that it is identical to the video  version. Of course DVD is better quality video and sound, and that makes  this a must for Zep fans everywhere. If you are a new fan to the group this  movie will solidify your enjoyment of the band, and unfortuantely is the  only official release of the band live, with some movie extras with members  of the band. Long live Led Zeppelin!  Lets hope they release some  unreleased concert footage on DVD next!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "A great performance, unfortunately undermined by a director and editor who think the movie is about them. The \"dramatic\" sequences are moronic in the extreme, and it's amazingly annoying to have the camera cut away from the performance to such pointless scenes as a bridge going by from a car. As though a band of this caliber and power needs some kind of visual support to make it interesting. . .  And even when they do allow us footage of the performance, there are a number of places where the visuals and the sound are completely unrelated---not just out of sync but Jimmy Page playing some other song than the song we're listening to.  It's worth getting for the performance, if you can tolerate all the nonsense you have to wade through to get to it."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Having not bought this item I thought it was great. You may not have heard of Led Zeppelin because they are an obscure rock band from the 70's that now with the re-release of this re-release have released a new set of remixed re-releases that might, for the impoverished group, gain them some of the reputation they justly deserve. These tracks are remastered and remixed from the original remasters and remixed again to give a re-re-mastered quality remix, the likes of which you have never heard before. The packaging, which I haven't seen, is very poorly designed with flimsy card-board and undersized T-Shirt."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "What can I say? This film was done in 1976 so visual editing was still,well, 1976 era type of editing. It's almost watching a home movie. Dont expect bright, crisp scenes. You'll realize this film has a ton of bugs as far as movie editing is concerned. Focus more on the music that these guys wrote and played. That's what this film is all about--- the music.The only sad note to this film for me is that I will never get to see John Bonham play again. He was to me the greatest rock drummer --- all time"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I must have seen this movie 20 times at the local theatre. Friday and Saturday nights at midnight they'd play Rock n Roll movies. I have never been able to stay awake through the whole movie. I thought at the time it was because we were staying up past midnight to watch it and we were just to tired to make it to the end. So when I picked up the DVD and brought it home after not seeing it for so many years I thought &quot;I'm finally gonna be able to see this movie from start to finish&quot;. I still fell asleep. This movie has not aged well. I LOVE ZEP. But this movie reminds me too much of Spinal Tap. The dream sequences.........Why are the there? The band looks very bored. They also seem to take this whole 'rock star' persona way to seriously. Spinal Tap was a spoof. This was not and looks like one. Long live Zep...........but you don't need this DVD in your collection."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is a &#34;cleaned up and expanded&#34; version of the 1976 release.  The sound, arrangement, and bonus material are fantastic.  I have fond memories associated with the original version and this new version only adds to those wonderful memories.  Some fans and critics have stated that these concert clips do not represent Zep at their best.  But, for me, I think they still stand head and shoulders above anyone else --- both in terms of musicianship and entertainment.  Unfortunately, I never had the chance to see the band live, but through this DVD set, at least I can imagine."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Their are plenty of reviews discussing the content of the film / concert.  My review is specifically intended to address the transfer of this film to Blu-Ray.  The source signal (at least on my copy) indicates a 1080i transfer (not 1080p).  Still, this is the best available version of this package to date.  Film is grainy in outdoor sequences, however concert footage is more than acceptable when considering the source material is over 30 years old.  Purchased this copy over the Best Buy website in December '07.  As other reviewers point out, it has since been discontinued in this particualar format and re-release timing TBD."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "I was born in 1977 (around the time they cancelled the tour when Plant's son died), so I never got to see the Zep in concert. So I was pretty excited when I heard that this video was available a while back.But there are a few things that I noticed. Plant sounded like he was losing his voice, the music wasn't always synched with the video, too many &quot;cheesy&quot; (IMO anyway) effects, etc. This couldn't possibly have been the best footage available, could it? As much of a ZepHead as I am, I still cannot call this the best representation of them on film. It isn't, from what I've seen otherwise.Most expensive home movie ever made? Feels like it. I enjoyed the music, but the visual needed more work."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Since this set isn't coming out for another month (it's now October 16), why are people commenting on it? I can understand thinking or hoping for certain things to come out. But that's what forum's are for, right? How can you comment on something you don't own yet? It's like saying how the weather for the next month just sucks...or your next car doesn't ride as good as your current one does. Again, if you've got questions or concerns, post to the forum; that's what it's there for. Leave reviews to real reviews of the product and not crying about how you hope the quality is better than the other versions.Just a thought..."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is the very best live concert video by AC/DC capturing the band at their peak and featuring the legendary Bon Scott.  I first saw this film on VHS back in the early 80s.  When the DVD format came out, I assumed that this would be one of the first live concerts issued.  But it took >10 years - I have no idea why.  Better late than never.  The video looks great; the audio is less than perfect, but good enough.  It's my favorite AC/DC video by far."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Amazing!!!!  It is rare indeed to find the kind of quality document that this beautifully restored film is.  The sound is round and full in both 2 channel and surround.  The DTS Master audio is actually a marvel.  Thunderous!  The picture is fantastic considering how long ago this was filmed.  I only wish there were more of this band at their peak, and for that matter for many other artists of that time.  The extra features are average, but nice with interviews of current and past rock greats commenting on AC/DC's influence, etc.  If you are a fan, than this is an absolute MUST!!"}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Why anyone would want to watch a roadcrew assembling a stage is beyond me but once you fastforward that, and get to the part where Bon grabs his beer before heading on stage, it is absolutley powerful stuff. He is a combination of Brian Johnson and Robert Plant in his heyday...a wild rock and roll throwback that lived for women and booze. He lived fast and died hard, and I truly believe he had no interest in growing old, so he was called home after a hard night of drinking. All AC-DC needed that night was a stage, and the music is raw and hard driving...the Angus &quot;show&quot; is highly amusing and he plays his tail off, while Bon sings his off....highly recommended."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "Let's checK:a. Concert: amazing. The best AC/DC video ever. In this concert, you can actually see the guysplaying, contrary to the annoying habit of bliding afst editing of recent realeases like RIVER PLATER, where you can'' t even see what's ging on, so fast the takes change from second to second.b. Package: very nice metal box, everything cool.c. Extras: the cards are ok. The pick also. The little book about the concert is well written. The really weak spot are the interviews, a bunch of guys (including awful Susan Masino) saying how great, magic, stupendous, marvellous, geniuses, beatutiful, breathtaking, everybody in AC/DC is.d. And, of course, you will not get a single special new interview made for this product by AC/DC themselves. (maybe due to Sony/Warner rights)."}
{"label": 6, "raw": "This is absolutely the best concert film of this band, and it is screaming for a remastering/sound touch-up. I went to alot of concerts in my younger days, and this video makes me nostalgic for that time, when a band just plugged in and ROCKED.  Let's get this on a nice 5.1 surround DVD!  If you like AC/DC, you have to find this. I bought mine at one of the locals thst still had a few video tapes for 5.99!  Glad I grabbed it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have tested this against the griffin dual output unit.I checked the charging current.This unit was charging my galaxy note battery with 70 ma.Griffin was charging with 40 ma! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for very long. I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend. They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone). Can't go wrong with the price and certainly can't argue with the benefits of OEM vs. generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The big store that is in every town now (can't say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "JUNK!!!......This product must be miss labeled.  I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.  The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens.  I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.  If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.  It charges fast and is dependable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Was here right on time.Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was the,Whole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient ..... The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well....I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems....I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct!Ugh!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "In a nutshell, this is NOT an OEM charger.  Although it has the Samsung markings, it doesn't seat well with a Samsung phone.  This means that it's either meant for another market or it's counterfeit.  With that said, I wouldn't buy this again.~~~~~~~~~~August 17, 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers.  After using this for a while, it is still garbage.  It does not charge my phone and in fact, it drains the phone.  This must be a counterfeit product.  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is good and the shipping is quick. The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm. Overall I feel my phone secured in the case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is. I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode. So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else...spend the extra buck on a higher end cable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2.99 shipped to my door.  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging.  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge.  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers.  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised.  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc., and at less than 25% of the cost.  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger.  we now have 2 t505 with the 2nd one intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo.  this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling.  by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge.  great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'll never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working...for the EXACT same phone! I just don't get it. I decided to try it out despite the people that said it didn't work, and I'm glad I did. It's exactly what I expected and wanted. I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work. For only $4 and some change for the both...this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last.  so this cord works on when plugged into the wall.  when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything.  so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but don't even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Phone charger works, it charges the phone. However, while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I'll have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Paid $0.32 for the charger and $2.81 Shipping & Handling.....Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work.....which is an all day job huh?  LOL!  Wow, I wish I could write reviews for a living wouldn't that be nice?  I think the total price of $$3.13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $10-$20.  Ms_Thrifty has done it again!  Stay tune to more reviews, Oh how I love Amazon!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this.  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth.  Overall good purchase for the money."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out.  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I don't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Love this type of headset.  I use one at work every day, so I got one for home too.  I hate things &#34;in&#34; my ear, so this quality over-the-head type keeps everything where it belongs and I can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation.  Comfortable and lightweight.  Doesn't even mess up hair.  It includes a leatherette &#34;cup&#34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don't even use it, finding it comfortable even without it.  It converts to an &#34;ear hook&#34; type also, but I don't find that very useful.  The inline volume control and mute is nice, although a bit large and heavy.  Great sound quality"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound.  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws. The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job, so mission accomplished. The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft, meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you're screwing. (Sorry, there's no other way to say that.) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances. I think this set will come in very handy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This comes with 4 flats and 2 philips. I believe they are also metric in sizes. I used one to take a part a netbook. I like the fact that they spin, come in a plastic kit. They are reasonably priced. These items are high quality. Handles are small and can be hard to loosen a screw if torqued down. I used them for a laptop not as a jeweler so... Nice case, nice color, small area, ... Comes in a card board cover as well. Packaged and more packaged. A little over doing it there. Can't be at times a little difficult to open the plastic case. Was going push up or down. Comes with different sizes. Some of the flats seemed a little thick in the blade. Not a bad item for the price. Always good to have a set of these around for glasses/sunglasses or for other items with small screws."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much. The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked, once it's in the phone it is not an issue. So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced. So far I would recommend this battery.Update: 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything. Drained it and charged from dead several times, made sure that location services, blue tooth, apps closed... all OFF and still drained. Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery.... A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It is chinesse(like almost everything in this world LOL) but they are really well done, and for the price they are a bargain.The screw drivers have a free rolling top to make pressure, and the body is rellay good, nice grip and 3 lobules ergonomics.The pliers are just as good as you can get, no problems with them and good finish on the edges, not like razors like othersthe prying tool is just what you need for almost any device you want to tear apart(besides the iPad) they have enough strenght to pry out plastics and even aluminun bodys of smartphones.There is to mini screwdriver, a flat an a phillips, I use them for electronics.Overall pretty satisfied, I would buy another one later on"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I tried two (yes, two) batteries and had to send both back because both were crap. I finally decided to spend a bit more hoping it would equate to more quality. Well that seems to have paid off (third time's the charm I guess). The battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly. It holds a charge well and reads the correct battery percentage. The included tools were a bonus. I already had a set of tools from replacing my wife's battery a while back. However these were much better. The old tools I had were stripping the tiny screw heads. This set of tools gripped the screw heads perfectly. Overall I'm very happy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset.  The Era comes with 9 different options for ear inserts.  But I always felt like the earpiece was about to fall out, unless I jammed it into my ear so far that it became uncomfortable.Enter the Jabra EarGels...  These made a huge difference.  It fit perfectly onto my ear (the nub on the top goes into the spot above the ear hole).  I could wear this all day.  I wouldn't wear these eargels without having an over-the-ear hook attachment on my Era, but these have made a huge difference for the comfort of my bluetooth earpiece."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "These are the exact ones that I was looking for but there is one problem.  They are supposed to be clear but they arrived yellowed in the package.  It is obvious that they are new, but they have yellowed and are no longer clear.  I bought these to replace existing ones that I have that have yellowed but not to the extent of these new ones.  I have had the previous ones since 2010.  I will keep as spares but am unhappy with the condition of these EarGels."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who's cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door. I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter. I more than got my money's worth out of it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I would agree with the majority of the reviews. I purchased this for my car. I don't have the MP3 connection but do have a tape deck. And I wasn't thrilled with the quality of sound with the FM tuners (my brother has one for his car). There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing, but with road nose and the general nose of the car, it is a non-issue...can't even hear it. The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection, but I consider it very good...(not sure it's even fair to compare). I use this primarily for audio books, and I am very happy with my purchase. I have not had to try the fix that some of the other reviewers had (something about needing to take out a pin on the inside of the cassette).I would definitely recommend!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Overall, I think that it's a safe investment in a mobile phone. One sad thing about cell phones is that they improve so quickly, there's always a race to have the best.Right now, this phone is one of the best, without the 300+ pricetag. If you're paying 300 for it, you aren't getting a good deal.Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display. Only downside is the wiping it off thing. Oils form your skin and ear show up easily on the pristine surface. Very clear pictures and nice graphics.I give it a 10 out of 10."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased, yet the best small headset ever made. It lasts forever! I only bought it for Xbox live but it works great with cell phones too. It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I'm not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great. So if you're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset. I went ahead and bought another one before they're sold out. Try to buy from OEM planet if they got it in stock, they are the best in my opinion."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work.Unfortunately it didn't work that well. I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo. Worst of all it was supposed to block outside sound, but it didn't do this at all.I know that it was designed for xbox so I am not going to give it 1 star. I don't have a home phone so I haven't tried it for that."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it.  Well, my husband tried it and decided he needed it since he did a lot of driving for work.  I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back.I love that I can use these with my cordless phones as well as my cell phone.  I prefer the corded sets, they just seem to have a better sound quality.  I love that this earpiece fits snuggly around your lobe.  I wear glasses and this works out great.  I go between this style and one that wraps around my head, it just depends on which handset I pick up.  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "More importantly, the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap, thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly.  When mine arrived, it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in.  No box, no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band, just chucked it into a bag.  I realize it's super cheap but it should last a month.  Is there we are at now?  I wish Amazon would be... at all selective on what they offer for sale."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers.  One tried to get it to work, and finally gave up.  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call.  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time...if there is a next time."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First a quick confession: I do not like T-Mobile.  I had them before and hated their (lack of) coverage and bad service.That said, the v300 is a very good phone.  I won't rehash the long feature list here.  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling.  This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the &quot;girlish&quot; styling, but it's still pretty cool.  Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had more USB adapters then I knew what to do with.  Enter the cyberpower 7 port hub... I am very pleased with it.  I'm not a techy, just an every day computer user.  I use my hub with my iMAC and it works seamlessly, have had no issues.  I bought another for a friend and she is pleased as well.  Like I said, it does what it says it will do with little effort, and works quite well for the technically challenged."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Okay, this little guy ROCKS!  When plugged in to an outlet, it will support 2 HDDs, a external ODD, and a printer with no issues.  Also, during a move I misplaced my power cord, so I called up the company... WOW, for free, the NEXT DAY, they shipped me out a replacement.  I would DEF. buy from them again, and will use more of these as the need arises.Also, it's been quite some time now since the purchase (over a year) and it works perfectly like the day I got it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really like this hub.  I have an Acer One Netbook, and I use this hub to power my cd/dvd external drive, my laptop cooler pad, and my 1tb external hard drive.  My cooler pad also has a few usb ports, and I have a 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged into that.  Everything works fine.  Sometimes I have to unplug my cd/dvd drive to get the netbook to read it properly.  I had that same problem with another hub though, so I think it's the drive.  It works more often with this hub than with my other though.This is very small.  The main picture makes it look huge, but it's really palm sized. I took it with me on vacation, and it fit just fine in the carry-on.  You don't need to keep the stand on it.I also like the one port in the front for when I need to plug in a usb drive."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I gave this 3 stars because it does what it says, its nothing high end and doesn't promise miracles, but I won't give it 5 stars because simply there's a terrible delay from when my computer comes out of sleep mode and from the time it actually recognizes this hub on the com ports for the PC, on average its about 15 seconds.  So I'll be sitting there waiting to enter my password like an idiot until the hub is finally recognized by the PC.  And its a really good PC, brand new, no problems with USB 2 or USB 3 except where this hub is concerned."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "A very good high quality USB hub. Windows recognizes everything you plug into this hub and, the USB ports are nice and tight.I will say in my opinion, for a USB 2.0 hub, the Cyberpower-CP-H720 is at the top of the quality hub chart. You can plug a DVD player or web cam into this thing and it will work perfectly. My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine. The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Positives: Bluetooth, IR port, VGA Camera, multiple e-mail accounts, speaker phone, more programs becoming available for Symbian O/S. I use Bluetooth for wireless headset and to make the phone serve as my wireless modem.Negatives: phone too big; voice recognition worthless, low volume from ear piece, IR port weak so TV remote control programs don't work well, slow menu's and response. Get Opera browser if your phone does not come with it since the WAP browser will only frustrate you (Opera has problems on this phone, but works most of the time). T-Mobile programmed the backlight in the display to turn off after a few seconds, although Nokia made it adjustable, and T-Mobile won't fix it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer). My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web, you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots, this phone will probably satisfy you. If you need Bluetooth, stay away."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I received this little gem for Christmas and now I refuse to speak into the phone itself.  This BT enabled unit is the perfect gift for anyone with a cell phone.No more complicated setups.  As soon as I turned this on, my Nokia found it, recognized it, associated it, and I was speaking into it.The battery life is great and the clarity is also dead on.Once you use this product, you too will never go back to speaking into your phone the old fashioned way."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster, and it is not the right antenna. Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it. This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon's problem. I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so, but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception.  Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry.  There is not excuse for this as Amazon has been told many times by Wilson Electronics that they are sending customers the wrong product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn't really as \"standard\" as one might hope!) However, it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn't care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).  The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase, so I don't know why it is proving as fragile as it has.  If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed, it is a good choice.  Otherwise, I suggest looking at other designs."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have had this headset for several months now, and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK, but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect, ie. no background or wind noise, and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off, when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset, I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought a similar one @ a local store & was surprised how well it held my phone, my sons phone & iPod.  I pd almost $6 & it is 1/2 the size of this one.  I needed another one & it looked bigger. Wow!! It's bigger, I have a. Portable fan even on one of these!!  I loved it so much, I bought another one. WARNING.... This has NOTHING to do w/ the product itself, BUT if u use this for your phone, iPod & it's HOT outside & u have this on ur dashboard... DO NOT put your phone or iPod on it!! My phone over heated!!!! Thank goodness it ok my phone.... But u live & learn. I also keep loose change on it... Glasses... Small toys stay too!!!!  Enjoy !!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I just love this keyboard. I've used it with my HTC and now with my unlocked iphone using BTstack Keyboard from Cydia. The only issue is that it really needs an extra row of keys. The numbers and symbols are placed on the top row of letters (where the letters QWERTYUIOP are in the keyboard). To access a number, you need to press the left function key and the corresponding letter. To type a symbol, you need to press the right function key and the corresponding letter. I work in finance and many of my annotations need numbers and symbols, like 10% for example. For that, it takes a long time. I find it easier to type \"ten pc\" instead of 10%.I'll buy a new keyboard just for that. But besides this, the keyboard is just amazing. So if you don't need your numbers and symbols too often, I really recommend it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First off, I have had this product since 2007 and was fortunate to catch it at a great bargain!!  Since then, I have not had one problem with it except when I forget to change the batteries!I have been able to successfully pair and use this keyboard with originally a Samsung I760, then a HTC Touch Pro 2 and now my Motorola Xoom tablet.  I was surprised that I didn't even have to download drivers, it worked once I simply paired it.Not having number dedicated keys was a sacrifice but I can type memos, emails or simply work on a novel at anytime conveniently by having this portable keyboard.  The keyboard itself is very durable and has a sturdy feel when you are typing."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Great sturdy design in every aspect. After pairing, it features flawless instant connection to your device every time you open it. A keeper for long, its quality shows it'll last for ages.I just wish iGO would start working on supporting Windows Mobile 6. It does perform as a keyboard should and it does carry out it's core functionality; but, I can't find the drivers for my device or any other WM6 device for that manner. I am currently using similar ones which, though do allow the device to work, don't allow all function keys to carry their purpose or softkey support to be accurate."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "For the money, this is a great item and a must have for mobile road warriors. I am using the iGo keyboard with a Blackberry Curve (8300).Like others have said, there is a nasty sticker that covers both the outside cover and the keys that may never completely come off. When peeling it off the keys, it feels like the keys will rip off their fragile posts.Also, as is common with Bluetooth, getting the two devices to communicate with one another can be tricky. I haven't used it a lot yet, so maybe I haven't figured out the right combination of button presses. But I hate when things don't simply \"work.\"The keyboard is fairly solid and certainly easy to type on, especially if you're accustomed to typing on a laptop. The keys are marked with several shortcut functions to launch tasks or apps.This is a great item for anyone who wants a lightweight substitute for traveling with a laptop. While sitting in a hotel room checking e-mail, this is all you need."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought these to replace my LG headset which kept dropping audio during phone calls.  The sound quality is very good.  It has a longer range than the LG. Overall very pleased.  The software that runs the headset is not as advanced as the LG, it doesn't announce the battery level and it can only be connected to one device at a time.  When it announces it is connected, if two of your devices have bluetooth on at the same time, you don't know which one it is connected to because it does not identify the unit it is connected to.Overall, though, I like them a lot.  The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's so so.  Not as comfortable as advertised and hugs your neck which i hate.  Has great sound but  is quite plain. I own an older LG model bigger for guys my size.... Has more control buttons for the different functions compared to the 2 buttons the Motorola has.The off/on button is in a bad place, every time I lay on the bench to lift weights I lay on the button which shuts it off ...Poor design. I wouldn't say not to buy it but a gadget person as myself I prefer the LG so I returned the Motorola and ordered a newer LG model .."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I just love this bluetooth headset. It was so easy to pair up with my new Sidekick 3. I did not have to do anything except charge the headset and then turn it on. Thanks again Amazon.com for providing me another great product at such a great price. The sound quality is outstanding. People on the other end just know that I am talking on a landline phone until I tell them that I am on a Bluetooth wireless headset and they are astounded. I highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for a brilliant headset at an excellent price. The Motorola HS 820 is the bomb!!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's a great deal, so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar, wish i could return that! But this headset, thinking it's from motorola would work well with my phone, but no. It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird, b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm using mine with the Jabra A210 non-bluetooth phone adapter and it works fine. I've used it in the office on my cellphone (handsfree allows me to type and talk with no wires) I use it in the car and it gives me great movement without wires. Very small clips around the ear and you don't even realize its there. Very pleased with this unit. I charge it overnight and it works all day from 530am till 11pm constantly receiving calls. I've had this for a about a week and I'll leave it on this weekend to see just how long it will last before running out of gas. I'm pleased with the quality of the Microphone and Earpiece. Can't believe just how well the mic works. I can shout and whisper and the volume is constant. This is my first bluetooth earpiece and I'm happy with it ! Some calls have slight distortion, but since other calls are crystal clear, I have to believe its the cellphone connection and not the earpiece."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised.  I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume.  Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise.  I found it only adequate in a quiet room.  I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal.  I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car.  It is fine if your sitting in quiet room."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "At first, I was a bit leary about buying one of these, because I had heard that they were never loud enough unless you were in a very quiet place. NOT TRUE! I have to say I've had to turn down the volume on this before! Now, don't take that out of context, but this is a great product. I live in Texas and drive a loud truck, and I've been able to use this product driving down the road! I would definitely recommend this product. A great purchase for the money."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this to connect walkman type gadgets to my car stereo.  It worked well at first, but the wiring quickly started having problems.  The sound would cut out and I'd need to mess with the cable to find a position where the wires inside would be touching correctly again.  After 8 months, the wire is now completely detached from one of the plug ends.  Maybe the heat of my car played a role in the breakdown of the cable, but if that's how you're planning on use it, don't be surprised if it starts shorting out on you too."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The concept of the phone is terrific.  I have to use a 2-way pager for work, and instead of carting around a cell phone and bulky pager, I now just have this one small item.  And while I didn't think I'd really use it, the Bluetooth functionality has definitely sold me.  I can use it not only for a wireless headset, but to connect to the internet and to transfer sound files back and forth as well.The software of the phone seems to be a bit buggy still, unfortunately.  When I lock the keypad, I still sometimes hear tones when the keypad is pressed and the display lights up.  The menus are sometimes slow to respond, delaying as much as 2 full seconds (doesn't sound like much, but it can be irritating).Overall, I'd buy the phone again without hesitation, but I'm an early adopter.  If you're willing to put up with the occassional buggy behavior, I'd definitely recommend this phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The A630 is another ground-breaking handset design from Motorola.  It showcases the ingenuity of American engineering when you see the QWERTY keyboard hidden underneath on this lightweight (4 oz.) cell phone.  It's stylish, too, and has great reception -- that is, where T-Mobile has coverage at all.  Compared to the Sidekick II and many other T-Mobile phones, the A630 has the best signal-keeping capability, but T-Mobile just sucks big time, unless you live right next to one of their sporadic cell towers.  Worse, their GPRS (data) network is slow and congested.  While surfing the web on the A630 is really cool when the network is accessible, for most part of the day the network is slow and often inaccessible.  We really need the govt to step in and mandate that these cell companies upgrade their networks first before charging consumers an arm and a leg for data services."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "it's the worst cell phone I had to date.1 this phone has 1 to 2 second delay when buttons are pressed.2 because of slow button key I kept doing and unding key lock/unlock several times to actually call anyone.3. battery life is only about 48hrs (standby) and defintly not 200 some minutes as what this phone's spec says.4. phonebook is pretty messedup. phone book name displys only first half of first line, although it allows you to enter two lines.5. on/off button some times takes second try.6. it's not straight forward to save work/home/mobile... under one name.7. phone charger connection is so flimsy that in certain position it won't charge. design is pretty messed up.8. 1/8\" of color lcd screen is already dying only after 5 month of useage.9. signal is very poor. I'm sure this lot more to do with Tmobile.Basically slow and unintuitive phone.Bright side of all this is that Tmobile contact is only for one year."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s. I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae&#8217;s which needed to be pulled out of the phone.  Since the phone antennae&#8217;s have changed, I haven&#8217;t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them. I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth. The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice. However, it's kinda huge compared to a regular cellphone, and I found that to be a bit of a drag. My service agreement seemed kind of pricey,  and the coverage was poor (I couldn't get a signal in my own kitchen, and I live in the middle of a big city, not out in the country) and in the end, I've shelved this phone for a smaller one with a cheaper monthly fee."}

{"label": 7, "raw": "I have used a lot of screen protectors for my iphone, and this one is the best. I'm happy to finally have a clear screen cover that works. For the past two years I wouldn't even try them, using only the anti-glare covers. Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there (wasn't the case with previous clear covers I had used). Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between. And finally, finger prints do not show up as readily as they do when there is no cover.Nice screen cover. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Absolutely love this screen protector. It came on time and the product was just as expected. I love how it comes equipped with everything you need to install it. A wetnap, dry nap, cleaning cloth, and the flattening clip you use to even out the protector once its on. It looked very professional and my Galaxy S4 Screen looks SUPER vibrant and clean. You can not even tell that theres a screen protector. I would recommend this screen protector to anyone because the value surpasses the price. Afforable and efficient."}

I am very careful with my device, so I do not know how it will handle items scratching the screen or fingerprints..I received it quickly, and I didn't have to pay for shipping, plus because I bought one item, received this packet for free. It comes with two screen protectors. If you follow the directions, you should not need the other. I have purchased others, and followed the directions and still end up with lint underneath...

{"label": 7, "raw": "Guys,I have used several of my friends bluetooth headsets (motorolas and jabras) and had decided I didn't want one.  Then I found the Mobile Freedom and read the reviews.  I know Logitech and have used a lot of their stuff with good results so I tried it.  IT DOES EVERYTHING YOU HAVE READ!!  It's quiet in the wind, it's battery lasts for days for me, it's easy to use, easy to pair and the sound quality is awesome!!  Nobody could ever tell I was using a headset.  It takes a bit to get used to the ear clip, but once you do there are no problems.  It may be a bit heavier and larger than some, but then those little tiny ones that look so chic also have TERRIBLE reviews and TERRIBLE performance!!  Try it out, you won't regret it."}

They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset, but not just a replacement, an $85 replacement! Then told me to keep the broken one, which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue!Really incredible customer support...I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name!BTW, 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech."}

The sound is good even in noisy environments. The headset is light, confortable and fits well.My only complaint is about the smart button used to turn on/off, answer, dial and pair. The button is also a LED indicator. The LED flashes diferently (different colors, intervals) for various modes but it is difficult to see the LED while pushing and holding the button. After a few days I got used to it and now I know how long to hold the button down to switch on/off, pair or use voice dial.At $42 it is a good deal."}

I plugged the blue-tooth back into to the charger, it had a steady blue light and i tried pairing it to my phone while it was on the charger and it worked; unfortunately, i can not walk around with a charger and outlet attached to my head. Consequently, this was a lemon and due to the months passed from my internet purchase, i am unable to return it or exchange.Therefore, the moral of the story is to test everything you purchase from the internet.

{"label": 7, "raw": "This bluetooth is basically ok but the part holding on to your ear is very 'flimsey' and tends to want to fall off if u bend over so u have to keep securing it on your ear, which is quite annoying as I almost lost it a few times not realizing it was no longer on my ear...so it's a huge drawback for me. It seems to work ok otherwise tho sometimes I do have a  sound problem that is not present when I just listen straight from the phone without it...it's sometimes quite garbled. So this product for me though cute, is average in fuction."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I needed a BT headset for the longest time.....since I never used one and was getting worried that I may get busted one day.  I saw this on Gold Box and ordered it immediately for $15....how could you go wrong?It is intended for use primarily with a Blackberry Javelin (8900).  It paired quickly has held a charge for 2.5 days thus far (light-moderate usage).  My opinion is that it does what it should at its price point and I was not expecting a miracle.If you are looking for a BT set that has loads of noise canceling and voice detection..then this is not for you.  Look for a Jawbone by Aliph...The H500 is a model that has been around a long time and is perfect for my needs.  I just wish it were a bit louder and thus I am giving it a 4/5.Great value, great item."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.  Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option.  This phone is far and away the best one in that regard.  I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My wife and I each purchased V551s with our migration to Cingular 6 months ago. In that time (during which the phone was never dropped, bumped, etc), I've replaced my phone twice, and hers once. The problems we've had include:- random \"white screen of death\"- Bluetooth connectivity problems (isolated to phones)- dropped calls in perfect reception areas- random battery indications- the infamous \"Unable to Charge\" problemAdd to that Motorola's lousy phonebook and UI, and retarded Bluetooth handling (e.g., if any BT device is connected, the same Moto default ring sounds, regardless of sound profile or caller-specific ringtones), and you have an overpriced, overhyped, oversize paperweight.I'm fortunate Cingular offers my company's employees discounts on new phones, so that I can go back to Sony Ericsson. My old T616 gave me 2 years of perfect service, even after having been dropped twice. It's on its 2nd owner now, who has used it for 6 months problem-free."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The only downside with this headset is that the first one I owned broke after about 2 years of use. First the ear \"hook\" piece broke off. Then the 2.5mm jack broke while in a plug - I'm only glad it was in an adapter and not my phone at the time or it would have ruined the phone.I bought another one and it works fine. Hopefully that broken 2.5mm jack was a one-time thing. Otherwise the sound quality and fit are great. The reviewer who says the ear piece is too snug should use a smaller ear piece - there are 3 different sizes that come with the headset for each ear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought a different BoxWave Patent Leather Clutch with magnetic closure and was so impressed by it's functionality. BoxWave changed the style to a snap closure and I didn't realize it until I received it.I'm not taking stars away because of my mistake, but by the usual problem I have with snap closures. I have to spend extra time trying to snap it together because it doesn't just close on its own like with a magnet.The case also had marks inside under two of the stitches and shows mark on the patent leather as soon as I run anything slightly against it. I used this case once, maybe twice, had to return to the magnetic BoxWave leather clutch instead."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all. You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse. Money part needs length to really pack some cash in. Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase.  Id say purchase a cheaper product like this. Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless.  Buyer be aware. Update. I stopped using this. The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it. Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces. Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I actually like this case a lot. I was worried about the price and it being a TPU and all. I have to say, I have a feeling this one is going to last a lot longer than the Spigen Neo-Hybrid I owned for 3 months before it broke. And even better, I can fit all of my charging and headphone devices perfectly, unlike the Spigen. It doesn't make the case bulky, as it may look. It actually feels quite nice in my hands. Overall, I really like this case. If that happens to change eventually, I will absolutely re-review it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Does what it needs to do at an excellent price.  Fits well, seems rigid enough to prevent some damage, and the kickstand is a nice touch.  I don't know how well the kickstand will hold up over time, but works well.  The ridge around the front allows me to put the phone face down without it touching a table.  The case is pretty compact and still fits into the Smart Dock, although it prevents HDMI from registering.  So it charges and goes into dock mode, but doesn't seem to sit down far enough to engage the HDMI."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm very pleased with this case. One piece that slips on fairly easily. It's not real grippy like some but has enough grab that you can hold onto it. Goes in and out of my holder and pocket easy enough. The stand on the back works great! When the stand is closed it's flush with the back of the case so it lays flat. Some cases, with stands, have hinges and parts that sick out. The blue is nice and true to on line image. I really like it. The price is amazing!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought two of these, one for me and one for my girlfriend.  She likes going out without a purse or wallet, but would like to hold her ID and credit card on her, and she does manage to fit both cards in this case, but it is a very tight fit.I use my case to hold my ID card for work.  It is an RFID card that we use to badge in and out of the building.  I always have my phone on me and therefore, always have my work badge on me as well.  The case is very low profile and holds up pretty well.  It doesn't offer a ton of front or top/bottom protection, but if you're looking for a case to take out to the bar, or something to hold a credit card/id, this works great!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The case took almost a week to arrive. You buy a cheap case, you're going to get cheap case quality. Stay away. The inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all. Will scratch your phone. Looks as if someone dropped it in dirt. Could not clean whatever gunk was on the case. Thank God it didn't scratch the aluminium on the case. A credit card didn't even slide all the way down into the case. Good luck trying to fit two in there. Spend your money else where."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is no imitation. I bought a knock off because it was $15 vs. $30 locally. The knock off died in a month. I saw this, at this price, and figured I had little to lose. It charges my cell phone quickly, and does not heat up. Interestingly, the phone does not get hot either, as it did with the first charger I had that came with the phone, as well as the knock off. It is great, and so cheap, I should have (will) buy more. This is a no brainer. It is reliable and works better than what I have had. Not much more I can say."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the original Motorola car charger and is the only one you should consider. It works well and seems to have good protection so that you can start your car with it plugged in without frying your phone or the charger itself.The Motorola logo on the end of it lights up when it's plugged in, which looks very cool especially at night. I was pleasantly surprised by this as well as the performance and build quaility.I can't vouch for the company shipping it out promptly since mine was included as part of my RAZR phone bundle but I would recommend this charger to anyone with a RAZR or PBLE phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought one of these and the second time I plugged it in the light on the end went out and it stopped working! This thing is junk, there is no way to replace the fuse (if there is one) without destroying it. I tried to take it apart, but you can't without breaking it. If this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design. Now do I break it open and hope I can get it back together or toss it??? I have NEVER had a problem with a car charger in the 10+ years I have owned a cell phone, that should tell you something! How do you screw one up?! You hire the idiot who designed this one thats how!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Sound quality is pretty good.  The wind \"technology\" is not bad.  Stong winds, blowing sand etc,  is going to get heard with this.  But for the price it is comfortable.  For someone who has to buy special adapters to get Blue tooth devices to stay in my ear I am impressed with this.  I wish it had a call end button on the thing.  But the mute button is great.  I would buy this again.  And i like it almost as much as my jawbone.  Paring is not an issue with wired devices.....  ;)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "OMG this has got to be the smallest piece of junk I have ever paid for :) really this charger died 2 weeks after I pluged it into my car.the charger itself is made of cheap plastic,light weight and just down right worthless. the 2 weeks I had it pluged in,it never gave my phone a full charge,i drove 63 miles with it pluged into my phone and yet still did not fully charge it.guess you get what you pay for.so if you want more,then you'll have to pay more."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It works and has a low profile so that I can close the cigarette lighter door when it's not in use - two things I like.  My Android phone warns me to use the (Verizon) charger that came with the phone or charging will be very slow.  This may just be intrusive marketing by Verizon because the charger seems to work as well as any other and it keeps the phone charged when using it for GPS directions.  I have not used it for a tablet or iPad which requires more juice."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was unsure about this case, as I text a lot, and thought it might add too much for just sending a quick text.  But this has not been the case.  It holds 2 cards, an ID, and a small amount of paper money, but not much.  Its not enough to replace your wallet, but enough that I was able to replace my wallet with it.  If this style of case is what your looking for, then this is the case to buy.  It feels like its of a high quality, leather has worn well so far, phone does not slip out, does a good job of protecting the screen.  The only negative I can see is that the leather oils tend to build up on the screen and need occasionally wiping off, but this is a minor issue that comes with the full leather case territory."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this for my father who uses a Nexus 4. The case looks and feels really nice and generally works well. However, there is one significant problem - the inside leather leaves an oily residue on the phone when closed. Suede and leather do need to have some oil retained to keep them in good condition, and while this makes the material look and feel wonderful to the touch, it is a bit of a problem when it comes to these kinds of electronics. The genuine leather on the outside is nice, but I think a synthetic inner lining may be more appropriate for this type of thing."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love the case and it came 2 days early but there is some gripes i have. first of all there is a strong chemical smell as if the case was just freshly stained and second I had to remove the back of my galaxy s3 phone in order to get it to fit in the new case. and ive had it and been using it for 3-4 hours now and the smell is all through my house. it makes my throat hurt and im coughing so im going to leave the case outside for a couple of days and see if the smell goes away. I hope it does because i really wanted to use that case.I will update in a few days. if anyone has any suggestions on how to make the smell go away please let me know.update: ok i left the case outside for 24 hours and it seems to be ok now. but i still have to remove the back of my phone for it to fit. my phone is the galaxy s3 SGH-I747"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the best bluetooth device I've tried.  It is lightweight, comfortable, easy to set-up, good sound clarity and it is a very well made and sturdy device.  There aren't flimsy parts that can break.The best thing is that the ear peace is fairly inconspicuous as it sits over your ear.  I really don't want to look like Janet Jackson in her Control video as I walk around town or the mall.The problem is in finding replacement ear gels.  They are not available on the Jabra site or on any other site.  I ended up back at Cingular (now AT & T) and they gave me a couple that they had in a drawer."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this headset at the same time as my Verizon Palm Treo 650.  Pairing was a snap, and it supported the hands free profile.  The call quality was great on both ends (however wind or car A/C caused people on the other end to have lower quality).  I only charged it twice - day one and one week later.  I used it for about a total of one to two hours a day on my commute.There was just one drawback, and it was a deal-breaker for me.  I wear glasses, and the bulk of the headset behind the ear made it very uncomfortable.  I returned the headset today after I had to end my call on the way home after 20 minutes.  If you don't wear glasses, this is an ideal bluetooth headset for the Treo 650."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this unit for about a year, it acts as an ear plug on the ear I'm wearing it on, and I can hear my caller even in strong winds. The audio quality is great. Since the microphone sits directly in front of my mouth the caller can hear me just fine and many times they don't know I am in the car. Since it's a wired unit, there are no batteries to charge and it's always ready to go. If you don't mind things in your ear this is a great head set.Update: Moved to an I-Phone from my Palm phone. I had to get a 2.5mm adapter to 3.5, The phone does not see the headset most of the time and won't route calls to it. Same with Blackberry Curve. I hope sure will make a new model for these phones, I miss using it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I drive a convertible and I have gone through 6 different hands-free devices that didn't work. Wind noise is awfully high with the top down, and my wife could never hear me when I talked on a hands-free. That is no longer a problem. The Shure works great! It is comfortable, clear sounding and best of all - I'm audible when I speak. If it had a \"turbo\" button, it would be perfect, but other than that - it is terrific. This is the best I've seen..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was one of the lucky few to get one of these free for registering my Motorola MPX-220.  I was skeptical to the whole bluetooth scene, but this headset quickly changed my mind.The device will easily last 3-4 days in standby mode with average usage.  The sound is excellent, and people who listen think I'm talking on a normal phone.  The range is great.  I can be about 50 feet away without a problem.The best part about the phone is the intuitive on/off.  When the microphone boom is \"folded\" out, it turns on.  Fold it back in, and it turns off.  Simple, yes.  But many other headsets require you to push buttons (or hold them down).  This makes using it a snap!I actually have one for my home office and another that I leave in my car."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a terrific device.  I use it with my Motorola RAZR V3 and it works great.  I don't know what I did without a wireless headset.  Two things that could be better - first it doesn't recognize ring tones from my phone (but I think that is the phone's problem not necessarily the headset), and second, it occassionally will drop the signal from my phone causing me to scramble to figure out how to go from the headset to my phone.  This doesn't happen very often so it really isn't that big of a deal."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "When it comes to headsets, the sound quality is the bottom line for me. I'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it. I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. The fit was a bit loose but not a huge problem. The big issue for me was the muffled sound, both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse. (I also tested the Motorola H700 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one.)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have been very happy with this headset.  I use it with a Motorola RAZR V3.My last Bluetooth headset was a Jabra, and it broke after just a few months -- the power button quit working, so it was always on until the battery drained.I love the HS850 since it has no power button!  Instead, you just flip it open or closed.  It gets great battery life, since it's so easy to put it in standby by flipping it closed.I have also used this headset successfully with Skype on both Windows and Mac.  The only catch is that it can only be active with one device at a time, so you have to disconnect/release it from your cell phone, before you can successfully use it with Windows or Mac.  This makes switching back and forth between your PC and phone a bit cumbersome.  Of course, it took a couple of hours to get it working under Windows, but it worked first try on the Mac ;-)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got two of these.  One for my wife and one for me.  I can not tell when she calls me if she is on the phone or using the headset ( maybe that is more a comment on the phone :) ).The voice interface of the phone has more to do with how well this works.  On my wife's phone she has to train each contact she wants to voice dial.  Not very practical.  On my phone it just figures it out but sometimes I am not certain who it has decided to call.  We both end up dialing through the phone and using the headset to talk and answer calls.  (We both have Verizon WM5 PDA phones.)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this to protect from scratches, from accidental dropping and to make my pocket not heavy.. This cover has proved satisfactory in all respects: I dropped the phone a few times already and thing happened. After using the phone for 9 months, it still shines line new - not a single scratch. It is very easy to put on and off. There are 2 minor issues with this:a) You need to take extra care when you plug on the charger, to make sure the phone charges - the leather cover comes in the way of the charger - after a few accidental \"battery dying out\", I learned to connect it properly to get a full charge.b) The elastic band/top cover comes in the way of the camera - so for taking pictures, I remove the top sleeve.c) Inspite of all the positive feedback, I still feel it makes the phone bulky, but the belt clip is very tough, and I don't mind the extra bulk to act like a cowboy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I owned the V300 and found it to be a bit quirky, strange things would happen when ever I charged it, when it was finished all the personal settings would revert back to factory standard. They seemed to have fixed that with this latest version of the phone. My understanding is that they have combined the features from both the v300 and the v 600 to make this phone. I've only had it for 1 week and so far so good I always enjoyed functions such as speaker phone, voice dialing and voice memos, now I get the blue tooth and a much better redesigned key pad along with video clip capabilities. All of this is good news! If I had to pick a down side I would have to say that I'm dissapointed that Motorola decided to make this phone look exactly like the v300. I like what the body of the phone feels like, but a change of color would be better, maybe silver."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Over the years, my household has tried multiple Bluetooth solutions for our hands-free communications needs. We've had acceptable results from a solution integrated into GPS...but much of our regular driving doesn't include the need to load up a full-size GPS. We've had acceptable results from a visor-mounted Bluetooth speaker unit, but let's face it: sometimes we want to hold conversations that don't include everybody in the car:-)The Plantronics Voyager 510 has proven its value overs more than three years of demanding use. It fits comfortably over your ear excellent incoming and outgoing audio clarity. Best of all is its outstanding ability to hold a charge for a long time. I can generally count on more than a week between charges, even during periods of heavy use.We liked this enough to buy three...one for each driver in the house."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have owned several Bluetooth cell phone headsets, and the PLT 510 is the best so far. It fits my ear perfectly, I can wear it for hours without noticing it, and it gives great sound. I had no problem syncing it to my iPhone, and although I haven't tried any other devices, I anticipate no problems.I only have two complaints:1. The on-off switch is very small and hard to use. I find that I have to push it with my thumbnail to make it work. If you have smaller fingers, you may have less of a problem.2. Plantronics uses a proprietary connector for charging, while other manufacturers are switching to mini or micro USB. A proprietary charging interface means one more wire to carry with me.In summary, a great purchase."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have owned this 510 for almost four years and have worn it nearly eight hours every day.  I have been very satisfied.  The cons for this ear piece are it does not block wind and background noise very well.  My ear buds are getting very loose after four years, so I am ordering another set of those.  I also ordered a new pro plus headset after watching the product demo in the wind tunnel.  Very convincing.  I will rate the new headset after I try it out.  At any rate, you can't go wrong with  the 510."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset generally works, though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are:1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear, but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it, its hard to get out of your pocket.3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car, I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly. It disturbed my passengers too.4) Wind tolerance - it's better than my H700, but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I'm sending mine back and getting another H700."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The last Bluetooth headset I used was a Motorola something-or-the-other, and frankly I was underwhelmed. A few years later, I tried thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging], and it was amazing. For the most part, people can't tell that I'm on a Bluetooth headset!The Pros: Great audio quality! Good battery life.The cons: I only wish it had a better earpiece... on that really goes INTO my ears, like mySony MDR-XB20EX 9mm High Sensitivity Driver Extra Bass EX Earbuds. The volume and mute buttons are kinda small and hard to reach/press.Those are just small details though. Overall I am impressed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This unit replaced a Motorola HS850 conscripted by my wife :-)It's better than the HS850 in the following ways:1) People hear me better.  Mic is really good.2) When the unit fits properly, audio amplification is betterIt's worse than the HS850 in that:1) it doesn't fit as well.  I find myself readjusting it throughout the day2) It doesn't synchronize instantaneously with my MPX220 like the HS850 did.  It always syncs eventually (15-60 seconds).Battery life is a tie.  Both are OK, but not as long as I would like (I've had to recharge mid-day a few times.  1-1.5 hours of talk appears to be the limit)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've tried the Motorola ones and either I couldn't hear or the person on the other end couldn't hear (usually both).  I bought this based on a recommendation of a Realtor that swore by it, and to be honest, I have only had occasional trouble with it.  It's comfortable to wear, it's easy to hear, the other person hears me.  I wear it most of the day, on project sites, while driving, even at home.  It works as expected and I'm very pleased with the results.  If you need a bluetooth, this is the one."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak. The other person can not hear me at all.  So I contacted Plaintronics for repair.  Their repair process has no tracking, just sending in your headset to an address.  Two weeks later, I received a used one back, not the one I sent in, packaged in an OEM box. Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in, it battery is not very reliable to hold charge, also the battery portion is kind of loose.I can not recommend Plantronics product at all."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Item does work well as far as sound quality and setup ease. However ear loop is basically not adjustable at all, consequently making the ear piece itself to constantly work its way out of my ear and feel as if it were just hanging there... After days of pushing ear piece back into my ear canal and hoping the loop would give a bit. i returned it for exactly those reasons... Great sound quality and no one i spoke to claimed to hear any distortion. just didn't fit well with no possible adjusting available..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We have two, and we love them. They work very well, like much better than the Motorola's we had, and these are quite stylish and unobtrusive. Now, I will say that I switch back and forth between the smallest ear piece and none at all - with it, it fits better and you can hear better, but it starts hurting a little after a while, have to take a break; without it, I can wear it all day, but, it dangles a little awkwardly and sound is sacrificed, a little, but certainly bearable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is my second headset replacing the Motorola one that came with my cell phone.  People I call tell me that the sound is very clear on their end and cannot tell that I am using the headset - sounds just like I am talking into the phone.  That was not the case with the first one. I travel a lot and wear the headset for long periods.  My ear does not get tired or sore from having it on.  The headset seems well balanced and never seems like it is going to fall off regardless of what I am doing.  I also like that it folds flat for easy carrying in my shirt pocket."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this for my self to use with my Motorola V3XX. I got home on the delivory day to find that my husband had fallen in love with it. He had allready paired it to his Blackberry. I had to purchase this one for my self. I have had only one problem and my husband has the same one. We are not able to walk more than 10' from my phone before we get the crackeling sounds and loose the ability to communicate with the person on the phone. We love the sound quality! We love the quality we get on he other end. The person on the phone says it all sounds great."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The sound quality is tops both at the sending and receiving ends. However, the ear hook is on the thick side. This can be a problem for ears that lie close to the head - the earhook pushes the ear away from the head. First, this does create a rather odd looking mismatched pair of ears! Second, it can become uncomfortable after prolonged use. It also poses a problem when wearing eyeglasses - one temple rests on top of the headset ear hook with the other at ear height. This causes the eyeglasses to rest lop-sided. So, buyer beware. The sound quality is great. The comfort issue could be a problem for you."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "i bought this one because of the excellent review, however, after pairing it to my Treo 650 and using it for a couple of days, i'm quite disappointed.  The sound quality is ok, sound level is on the low side and some noises from time to time.  i had a Samsung WEP200 too and had better quality than this one, and Samsung WEP200 is about half of the price of this.  then there is the usability issue too, sometimes i hear the phone ringing, and pushed the button to accept the call and it wouldn't connect right away, had to wait several seconds to establish the link, the Samsung WEP200 and another Motorola ear piece i had did not have this problem."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had 3 headsets already, and each one had something about it that I didn't like. I hesitated to buy this one, despite the great reviews, because I wanted one that didn't give me the 'telemarketer' look. Top things I was looking for were: sound quality, comfort, and battery life. This unit delivers on all 3 counts. It sounds fantastic, it's really comfortable (especially with the Jabra EarGels on the ear piece), and the battery lasts a long time. Looking back, this is the one that I should have bought in the first place. Recommended."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I admit, I was turned off at first by the size and shape, but was easily won over by the quality of the sound and the comfort. This is as good as bluetooth gets.The downsides are the rediculously small buttons for power and volume, which are almost unusable for most, but fine for me.Today I thought I lost my headset. I found it in a parking lot, ran over at least once, in the rain for at least 12 hours. 10 minutes under a hair drier and it was working again! I will buy another when the time comes."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The reviews available on this product from the amazon website really helped me make a great decision.This model may not be the \"latest\" technology but it's enough for me. I only use it in the car because of all the issues that have been raised about driving safety. I feel better with both hands on the wheel, both eyes on the road.I'm not a device geek but this really works for me and the few requirements i have.Simple to use, I set it up in 10 min max.Fits fine, but I do activate the connection before i go down the road because the buttons are small and can be difficult to activate if you already have it behind your ear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is only my 2nd headset, and I much prefer it to the Motorola HS850.  It stays in your ear and has plenty of volume to overcome road noise in a car.  However, when my headset is on for extended periods, it sometimes experiences problems (will answer calls but not transfer them to the earpiece).  Turning headset off then on again fixes this problem.  Battery life and charge time seems excellent, but I don't have much to compare it to.  For those wanting to use it with your office phone also, the Plantronics bluetooth office phone adapter is EXPENSIVE ($200+ in Office Depot)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this due to the law changing to hands free in my state.  I am not a big fan of bluetooth but I saw the writing on the wall so I read the reviews and picked this one.  I am glad I did! This was very very simple to set up and charged very quickly.  It synced easily with my android phone.  I like that it comes with various sizes ear buds so you can get the right fit. It stays securely on my ear and I never feel like it is flapping or going to fall off.  When I make calls, the person I am calling says I sound like I am talking directly on the handset so I am pleased.  I have not tried any of the voice command features yet so I cannot comment on those. Overall, I am pleased and would definitely recommend this headset!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "For several years I used a Logitech Bluetooth for my cell phone, and while it worked great, it was always uncomfortable. When it snapped in two, I decided on the Voyager 510! Wow, not only does it work great, but it is VERY, VERY COMFORTABLE! In fact, I can honestly say I actually forget that I am wearing it, something I cannot say about my previous device. So for all of you thinking of a headset, you cannot go wrong with this one! Five stars!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been using this headset for about two weeks with a Blackberry 8700C. The headset has a very comfortable fit and the volume is nice and loud. The downside is that the battery life seems a bit sub-standard. I have been caught several times using it and running out of batteries. I also have some random disconnects with my Blackberry. Tough to say whether these disconnects are phone or headset related. I think this is a great value for the money though and prefer it over the Motorola's and Jabra's (better fit, louder sound). There is some difficulty pressing the buttons on this headset too - nothing that I could not work around though."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I thought to come write this review because it is the 2 year anniversary of me buying this phone. I have never had any protective cover or case on it and it is still not very scratched up and it works as perfectly as when I got it. I had to replace the battery at 18 months but it cost $10 with shipping online for a genuine Motorola battery. Every other cell phone I have had has broken in some way long before 2 years. I'm amazed it is still in such great cosmetic and mechanical shape. No reason for me to get a new phone anytime soon."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I ordered this charger as a travel companion, so I didn't always have to pack my original charger.  It's been wonderful having one I can just leave at home and one that travels with me.  I've had no problems with this charger at all.  Be aware that this is a MINI-USB connector, and while it will charge my newer smart phones, it requires a Mini to Micro -USB adapter... and is not as fast as the new chargers. But it does just fine for an over-night charging from less than 10% to fully-charged."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "As other people have said, the headphones are a bit too heavy on the ears.  After 3 weeks the crack in the headband started, after 2 months the crack is so big the headphones stopped working.  I will try returning them for a replacement but I don't see why, as the design just isn't very smart with the headband cracking in the only place that is under stress.  They should have reinforced that one spot.It's a shame as the sound was really top notch and I used to be able to connect them to my ipod and leave it in my bag, or connect to my PC via 'bluetooth advanced audio' and not disturb my wife while I'm killing  zombies in Half-Life 2."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "his and the white version of wireless headphone for ipod is being clearanced elsewhere for a good reason. I got one and it really cracks just by being flexed often enough, which is really unavoidable no matter how careful you are. It is only a matter of time. Mine cracked within a week, and yes I knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful. Unless you have a really small head (maybe the size of a softball), don't mind a cracked band or enjoy going through customer service, don't get it. it looks and sounds good otherwise, and works with computer bluetooth adaptors provided that you have software driver support for high quality bluetooth audio (a2dp). it's a pity."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I agree with the other poster. Why blame the phone because you broke the screen. Is the monitor at home bad because you dropped it off the table. The phone is the best smart phone out there. People have had issues with resets, but that is more of a conflict with the many apps that you can load on it and usually can be solved. I love this phone. Also...do not rate 1 star and then say the phone is good, but verizon is bad. That is unfair since it lowers the over all rating. Ignore the guy who broke his phone...this is a very good phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Just received it today from A1 Accessories.  I bought it solely to use on xbox live so I wouldn't have to keep moving my other headset that I use for work (I work at home).  My friends kept asking me to repeat myself.  One said that he had to turn down his tv volume so he could hear me (no lie).  I switched back to the other headset and I was back to crystal clarity.  After that, I threw this one in the trash.. Good thing it only cost me $5 or so."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Plug this in. Sometimes it connects; sometimes it doesn't.I hear callers just fine, but they ask if I am in the bathroom when I wear this.If I leave it plugged into the earphone jack of my phone, it somehow manages to turn my phone off after a few minutes of non-use.I would send it back, but my total cost was only $3.My phone is an older Motorola v365, and I'm sticking with to my BluetoothPlantronics 510 [Retail Packaging]. Maybe this can be an emergency backup."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I had the worry that the headset would not work with my SamsungT619, since the latter is not on the compatibility list. On the other hand, I've heard that all bluetooth devices with same standard (i.e. version 1.2) should have no compatibility problem. It turned out to be absolutely smooth when connecting to my Samsung. The headset can flash and even vibrate when call's coming.The headset is amazingly light weight. You can't even imagine a lithium battery is sitting in such a leather-weight body that can hold on for 7 hours' talking.I spent $10 on this headset and couldn't be more happy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This headset fits so comfortably on my ear and I especially like that I can use either ear. I can hear so much better with the Jabra than the expensive Motorola headset I had that was always falling off my ear.  In fact I was using the Motorola talking with my son, in a lot of pain and needing help.  When I turned my head, it fell off and out of reach.  My son called an ambulance when he could no longer hear me. My elderly Mom says she can hear me better on this headset too.Spring 2007 and this item stopped working.  I'm irritated that it didn't last longer."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "In case you were wondering, the ONLY differences between the black and silver RAZRs are:1. The Color2. The Price Tag (at some stores)There are NO new features in the black RAZR.  It has all the same specs (and bugs) as the silver model.In choosing a RAZR you should consider which color you like best, and whether or not you're willing to pay the price premium some stores are charging on the black one.You should also read the reviews for the silver model, since both phones are the same inside.A couple of other notes:-The keyboard on the black RAZR is silver.  Some people do not like this.-The RAZR (probably the silver one only) is rumored to be coming to another US carrier very soon (Hint: starts with \"T\", ends with \"obile\")-There will be a lot of new sharp looking phones with features superior to the RAZR coming out this fall."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I personally think the Black Edition RAZR phone looks really cool, better than the regular silver version.  The phone is otherwise identical to its silver twin... but, really, it just looks so cool -- and you'll differentiate yourself from The Crowd.The phone is very capable and packed with features.  Unlike some high-end Moto phones from a year or two back, this one works very well and has a decent interface.  Everyone I know who has this phone simply loves it.[...]"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "10 years into the cell phone revolution the phones have gotten smaller, lighter with great features but what's the point when you can't carry on a conversation? I have found Cingular to be by far the worst in terms of dropped calls in the SF Bay Area. I suffered thru AT&T and their conversion to GSM and Cingular is not any better than that service no matter what they promise. Cingular also has very consumer unfriendly 2 yr. contracts that you will be paying on long after that shiny phone has lost its lustre. They are constantly changing their rollover minute plans to screw you out of your minutes. When i downgraded from a higher national plan to a lower national plan they took away all the minutes I aquired in a year. In other words maximize the revenue - minimize the service is their motto.  I could live with this if i could make a decent phone call - i can't believe there are so many dead areas in a place with 13 million people."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This retractable cable is perfect for connecting ipods, phones, mp3 players, etc to the AUX input on a car. My middle console in the car tends to get super cluttered, so to have a cable which doesn't get tied into knots and make a mess is a huge plus.The sound quality so far as I can discern is great with this cable.The retractor mechanism can tend to get stuck, but has always quickly snapped back into place after I jiggle it for a second.The cable is only 3 feet long, which is perfect for me, but depending on where your AUX input is may not be sufficient, so be aware of what you are buying."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Holy mackerel, these things are awesome! Stows so very conveniently away and works very intelligently, locking in place wherever decide to stop it, rolling back up with just a tug. Have only had a couple of times where it decided to tangle up a touch when recoiling, but with almost no effort was able to pull back out and start over, coiling up properly like does all the other times. Buy a handful and have 'em in car, at computer, stereo - they're so inexpensive but so awesome!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This thing is tiny & lightweight and works really well in a vehicle where you don't want long cables hanging around (especially if you drive a manual shift car).That being said, I have had two of these. I used them daily, and they each lasted about 4-6 months, and then they stopped working. The cables are very thin and I think they just wear out after a while. For the price & convenience, it's not a bad trade-off. I would have given it 3.5 stars if I'd had the option.I decided against ordering a third and opted for something non-retractable but hopefully more sturdy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This earpiece worked well for me.  It had good range and sound quality and the hands free activation was very useful. One huge design flaw as I see it however was the on/off button.  To turn on/off the device you have to hold down the button.  After only a few months of use the button began to malfunction and over time the button totally stopped working. I purchased the device in November and by March the button had stopped working at all.  Since this is the same button that you have to push to answer a call, disconnect a call or activate voice recognition when the button stopped working the device became pretty useless."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I recently bought a new cell phone (Sony Ericsson Z520a) with Bluetooth. I spent a few days researching the various headsets out there, and soon discovered that only a handful appeared to be worth buying -- and all were between $100 and $150, which I did not want to spend. I came across these by accident, and couldn't find any of the negative comments common with headsets in this price range. Granted they're only Bluetooth v1.2, but they're light, have a built-in rechargable battery, are quite comfortable to wear, and have very good sound quality. In addition, the pairing process is quite simple.If your priorities are quality sound, comfort, built-in battery, and reasonable price, these will be hard to beat. I like it so much I bought a second one for my wife."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought the Plantronics 320 today. As soon as I walked out the store,the reception went static beyond belief. The salesman said \"Give it a chance\", I have and it's going back tomorrow. For the past week  I've bought 4 headsets(Motorola 500,850,700,& this one which is one of the worst.I found the Motorola 700 to be the best so far.  Clear reception most of the time,excellent volume(no problem hearing while driving),& it always connected to my treo 650.  On a windy day my friend on the other end didn't even know I got out the car,hardly any background noise.  I just ordered the 700 through Amazon,much cheaper than Cingular & Motorola."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this headset to use with my cell phone.  As it turns out I use it with my computer and love them.  They  are easy to use, long battery lfe and sound great.  They may be a bit uncomfortable or odd because of the back of the head design but all headphones have some kind of pressure due to the design.  The only time I notice their presure is when I wear them for a few hours.  Short term no problems.  By the way, I wear glasses so that may be the culprit.I'd buy them again."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Before I have this product, I have ordinary earphones for my Moto680 cellphone which has stero radio, also I have other moto blue tooth earphone, but this one is good, long time power supply but it is more heavier than the single ear bluetooth.Volumn control is good, loud enough. single ear BT is out of control some times, you may hear nothing when you walking on the busy street or windy days. This one give you all availability.drawback: 1. when phone call comes in, you will wait for longer time than single ear BT. 2. the size is big, can not put in your regualr pocket. 3. the pad easily drops, you may lose one of the two very soon. I used glue.Anyway, it is good one, you can talk to 2 hours meeting several times with one time full recharging.I love it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this headset for my wife for her to use with a Samsung A900 (\"the blade\").  The earpiece is extremely small and comfortable and the battery life is long enough for her to talk on it over an hour each day.  She charges it each night.  The sound through this headset has a typical \"bluetooth tinny\" aspect that overly compressed digital sound has but it is in-line with what I've observed on other bluetooth headsets.The number of adapters and the clever battery-powered charger attachment help this headset stand out from the crowd.Setup is a breeze and it is very easy to use.  She is not a technophile but she loves her handsfree Plantronics 640!The unit would be 5 stars if the sound quality were better.  I also wish it had multipoint like the 5xx-series from Plantronics."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I like the \"in the ear\" approach. It's extremely comfortable. You have several options as far as finding a comfortable fit. It comes with a portable charger, which is a prelude to things to come.I could hear any caller without problems but in noisy environments they couldn't hear me. In a quite environment it worked very well. The battery is terrible. Their listing is \"up to 3 hours\". There's no way you can get that much talk time out of this. I heard allot of static. I couldn't wear my phone in the holster because of that.I'm a frequent business traveler and it doesn't work well for my needs. However, it does have some positive traits. The main two problems are extraneous noise problem and poor battery life. So if you're not in a loud area or heavy user it's a great headset."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I read the reviews here and other sites and bought this headset, my first bluetooth headset for my samsung 870 phone. Came with a lot of adapter accessories for different phone chargers except the samsung models. So that was all useless to me. Nice silver case which looked good but also useless to me since I'm not going to carry an extra box around when I'm trying to simplify.ProsPairing was a breeze.Sound quality excellent with the windows of your car closed.no real complaints.ConsWith the windows of your car down it was hard for the caller on the other end to hear you, or the radio on for that matter.I could really never find a comfortable fit for my ear so guess what happened,The day we bought a 6ft Christmas tree I lost it....... fell out of my ear for the first time in public and now all I'm left with is a shiny silver case and a bunch of junk"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case cover is very thin and I imagine would only protect from scratches and the smallest of bumps. It fit my Nexus quite well, to the point it was causing me some trouble to get it over the edges of my screen cover. But once done I am happy with it. There is no excessive movement, the buttons work easily still and the cut out for the speaker and plug ins work perfectly. It also gives some extra grip to the rather slick Nexus, making one hand operation and reading safer and easier."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the best headset for truckers. The back ground noise can not be heard from caller. The ear pices is just the right volume. the Mice takes some use to it. When you talk, you talk in a normal voice. and don't have to speak up to be heard. If you put the mice at your mouth, it will distort the sound. The best place just below your lower lip. The paring has to be done every time to turn the headset on. Will not automatic paring at turn on. Good thing its easy do to.The charge time is great and really holds the charge in stand-by and talk time. the only thing I don't like its heavy and sometimes the mice gets caught on the shoulder strap, when looking side to side."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Amanda Richards hit the nail on the head, but she didn't get into how nice the Bluetooth is on this phone.  In addition to being a VERY SOLID (both in build and function) phone with a lot of features you wouldn't expect to find in something this low in price, you'll also get FULL Bluetooth 1.2 capability.What does this mean?Well, you can transfer mp3 ringtones to it, you can connect a headset to it, you can transfer themes and photos to and from it and you can even tether it to your laptop to use as a modem!If you want a fancy phone, you'll have to pay for it.  But, if you want a decent phone that has an awesome battery life, a sharp, colorful screen, Bluetooth that works and custom themes, then you can't do better than this!I like this phone and use it often as a backup phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The design is good and it would be an excellent product if the quality was anything more than terrible. The buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking. Now I press and press and nothing happens. It's a shame because the rest of it works decently.The suction cup holds well and the tube coming from the cup is pretty sturdy. It moves a lot when the car is moving so you would need to rest it on the dash which would help somewhat but not perfectly.Overall one star only because with the poor quality it is worthless in spite of the few good points."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Almost nailed it with this one, Bracketron. First, the good: the mount is solid, it stays stuck to the glass, and the flexible arm bit is VERY stiff and hard to adjust but really stays put once you have it where you want it. Now, the not so great: the flexible arm seems to vibrate quite a bit while you drive, and the expanding bracket does not work as well as promised. In fact, the button on the side only seems to open the bracket if you have it rotated 90 degrees to the left (as in landscape, with the button pointing up). I took it apart and realized that this is because there is an assortment of rather cheap gears which rely on gravity to allow the button to only work in one direction. I much prefer my Grip Go, but if you need a longer mount and/or one with a bracket then this one isnt bad for the price, just not perfect."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Great idea and design, not great execution and materials.It works good, but once mounted, almost impossible to adjust-out the sides with the ratcheting mechanism. You sort of have to tilt it backwards to make the ratchet action work. When mounted, you can't tilt it, so it's a real hassle to open.I have mine set, and I just wedge the phone into it when I want to use it.I primarily use it when driving through New York city, to use my phone as a dash-cam. Eventually I'd like to get video of the people that walk into my car or cyclists that ride into it... It's great for that.It's obvious the plastic or construction material allows it to fall out of tolerance, which means the ratchet action ceases to function. It's a crapshoot when you build a complex mechanism out of parts that break or wear easy, or aren't built to spec in the first place."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First, the White Screen of Death Issue.  I had 3 units til instead of returning tp Cingular.  I sent it back to SONY.  NO more problems.  They flashed it with the latest firmware and it works fine.  The WOD will seem to occur after you disconnect after a file transfer.  However, wait 20 seconds and the phone reboots.Pro: Loud and easy to hear from.Con:  Buttons and keypad is hard to get use to.Pro:  The camera is fine for a phone cam.Con: Battery drain is bad, when you play the MP3 player."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This phone has grown on me.  At first I wasn't sure I needed all this stuff, it felt a bit heavy, I was unsure of the swivel design, and I felt guilty for buying such an expensive phone.  But now I know I'd buy it again.  It's still a little heavy (compared to the Razr, which was my other choice) but the reception is great, it has lots of functions, and the interface is easy to navigate.  Best of all, the speaker phone function is one of the best I've ever heard.  It's loud and clear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Galaxy S3 is a great phone, but its finish is very slippery, and the phone is too easy to drop. This case solves that problem inexpensively, and without adding a lot of bulk. The volume and power keys are harder to operate than without the case, though. That's a good thing for the power button, as it prevents accidental power-ons. It's not as good for the volume control, though. But it's well worth the price.Note that in order to get the holes to line up right, I had to put the volume control side of the phone in the case first, then stretch the case over the power button side of the phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I picked this up on Amazon for under $20 after months of thinking about buying one. My needs are small; I'm not on the phone all that much, but in the car a lot. I'm also not overly picky. If it works...I'm happy.The Motorola is small; about 2.5\" long and yet it seems to pick up my voice quite well and the sound quality on my calls thus far has been good. Better than on my Nokia phone! The earpiece is adjustable, and fits my ear very well.The packaging on this item was kind of weird. Plastic baggie with the charger, bluetooth headset and directions. I guess I expected a box?The unit charged fully in about 2 hours. My Nokia phone picked it up just fine once I enabled the bluetooth to find it.All things considered, for the price I paid and what it does. I'm happy with the purchase. The true test will be the item's durability and battery life, which only time will tell."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this for my wife for christmas and i am disapointed in the voice quality.  When she is in the car talking to me on it I can barely hear her because of the car noise and even with her having the radio on low it is still annoying to hear everything in the background.  For the almost $50 price tag i thought it would be better quality since it was the step up from the entry level bluetooth.  I also havent found how to put it on the left ear yet, i feel like i am going to break it if i try to pull the ear loop off.I would recommend spending another $40 and buying the Jawbone bluetooth.  I got one as a present and it works great and fits better on my ear.  I drastically reduces background noise.Overall, I am not impressed by motorola and thought they would make a better bluetooth for this price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The weight is nice and balance on the year is good.  The features are good, but one must remember certain button combinations for extended features (like press two buttons at the same time to mute the microphone).  The battery life is good.  A significant issue is that it picks up surrounding noise better than the person's voice who is taking, which means that it often can't be used.  If you don't drive a very quiet car, like a BMW or Mercedes, then users may complain that they can't hear you and ask you to \"pick up the phone.\""}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Well, it's a good little bluetooth for the money.. I've only had a couple times when it's cut out on me and not worked right, but 3/4 of the time it works beautifully and people don't even know I'm on it! I think the times that I did cut out was because I was too close to metallic objects.. pipes and things.. so.. that sounds like a good excuse..eh?Works good for me, and is cute and small, fits like a dream, good battery life.. all in all is a good bluetooth."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews. I got it from Circuit City, so it's not a 'counterfeit'.  It pairs well with my Moto Q9C, and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it. The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise, and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable.  I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had my H700 for almost a year now, and not until recently did I learn it was a FAKE!  WOAH!  After reading the PDF on this page about how to spot a fake, I quickly learned the one I picked up on eBay was a fake.However, the headset has worked VERY well.  I compared it to a bluespoon AX7 in-ear headset, and I ended up keeping my fake H700.  Overall, it has been a very good copy, although not the real thing.  Very reliable.  However, I am still disappointed that I did not get the real headset.Is there anything I can do about this?"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I previously owned an H300 and was impressed with the quality for the price.  When I lost the H300 I decided to try the H700.  I was most interested in the improved sound quality and the fit around the ear.  In those two areas the H700 is definitely an improvement over the H300.  I did not use the voice activated commands, so I cannot speak to that, but I do see where that could be useful.Overall I do see the H700 as an improvement over the H300.  My only problem with it, which is why I did not give it 5 stars, was the Bluetooth drop out.  It seems that the Bluetooth on the H700 drops out more often than the H300.  I would say that it drops out on 1 in every 20 calls."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really wanted this to work.  It's a great design and it's easy to use and set up.  Sound quality listening is great.  Sound quality speaking, for others to hear, was unacceptable.  This could be because of the way it fits me, since this seems to work well for many others.  If you try this out, however, it's very important to check that others actually hear you well, and not, as in my experience, too loudly and with too much low end on the sound quality.  I'm returning it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a replacement for a prior Motorola bluetooth headset of very similar design. I was quite pleased with the old one, until after about 2 years when it just died. That was 2 years of daily service, so not an issue. But this new one has issues holding pairing with a Blackberry 8700G, and has significant voice static unless the Blackberry is on the same side of my body as the headset, and not in the holster. The old one didn't have that problem.On the positive side, the USB mini charger saves me one more power adaptor when traveling, which is a good thing. They should all have that feature."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I hear lots of static, even before making a call.  I have Motorola H500 too, and that headset has no static with my phone (Verizon LG VX8300).  This H700 has LOTS of static.  Called Motorola tech support, and their best solution is to return and replace it.  As far as usability goes, this a great headset, over the ear is more comfortable than in ear and the fit is perfect - nice and snug.  I'd keep it without any doubt if it wasn't for static noise.  While I hear static, people on the other phone can hear me fine, just as good as when I'm using H500."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this bluetooth headset for two main reasons. First, it uses the same charger as both my Motorola Razr and RIM Blackberry 8700C. Secondly the device easily turns on and off each time you extend the microphone.I've used about 1/2 dozen other bluetooth headsets and this is one of my favorites.Here are my summarized pros and cons:PROS:-Uses the same charger as other Motorola RAZR phones-Open/Close microphone to turn headset on/off-Small, lightweight and easy to put on (one handed eve)CONS:-Only connects to one BT device at a time. I have both a RAZR and Blackberry that I carry with me everywhere. With these two devices I cannot have the H700 connect simultaneously (other Bluetooth products - notably the Plantronics) are able to connect simultaneously to two devices.I recommend this headset, and Amazon has the most competitive pricing available. Easily beating even the discount superstores where I'd seen this for 50% more."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I like this headset. It is very comfortable and lightweight. Stays on fine when adjusted properly. The volume is great. Callers say they can hear me fine without noise interference. What I like best is You can close it to turn it off an open it and it automatically reconnects. You can answer call waiting with this too. Also I haven't had it randomly disconnect as I turn my head as my other one did. I don't know about battery life yet as i only have had it 3 days."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "However I just did not enjoy the size of this behind the ear unit, found it to be too big. It is a little difficult at first learning how to slip this around your ear but after awhile it works out ok. Please note that you do not get to use your selected ring tone, it automaticly (Motorola hand set) defaults to its standard ring while the blue tooth is actively connected. You can turn the ear piece off then power on to answer in order to keep your fav ring tone. All in all it works very well, sound and loundness were very good. However, I just did not like the size of this unit. It is quite bulky.EDITJust picked up a HS850, now that is more to my liking, however I hope there will be no issues of a broken wire in the flip boom as the reviewer above mentioned."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was tasked by my office manager to purchase some headsets to make our office calls easier.  I looked at corded headsets, cordless, and a variety of brands, but this unit kept coming up with high praises.The clarity is great, and it has a variety of volume (macro and micro) for both the mic and earpiece.  It works seamlessly with any phone system and has a multitude of connection options.  The range allows us to go to the end of our warehouse to look at stock while talking with the customer.  Not to mention that if I'm not at my desk and the phone rings, I don't have to rush back.  I can use both my hands to look up quotes, and stock while I'm on the phone without craning my neck.  Their are earpieces and over the head options.  Not to mention the battery life lasts all day as long as you plug it in at night.Great product!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have this headset for work and use the band that wraps around the head instead of just the ear loop.  I find this is the most comfortable option for me.  The headset has been great and I have never had a problem with it since i have owned it (approx 2 years).  The range is great and I can get up from my desk and walk to the printer during a call no problem.  Overall I am very pleased with this headset and others in my office have purchased this based on my recommendation and they love it as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My old Plantronics headset needed to be replaced and I went with this one.  It is much more sturdy, with the headset resting very comfortably in the charging unit.  My old one would 'float' once in a while and not charge when I thought it was, which meant I couldn't use it the next day until it charged for a while.  Not so with this unit.I had a behind the head band I use which for me is very comfortable and I can quickly take the headset off and it rests on my shoulders.  Sound quality is excellent.  I have not had any complaints on the other end either.Highly recommend this product for anyone needing versatility and walking around from the base unit.  I can easily get files from across the room or do other things while talking without missing a beat."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The ability to leave my MP3 music (cell phone) in my gym bag and get a serious workout without disruption is worth the price along. Being on call, it's also important that I don't miss any of those important phone calls. Getting interrupted with a voice announcement of who's calling makes it all worthwhile. After the first use I was hooked. All of my weekday workouts are with my bluetooth stereo headset. As for the weekends, I'm back to the Zune, not because I dislike the headphones, because I need to escape from the phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've been having it for weeks. It works fine when both listening to music and talking via Skype. The mic pick up my voice quite well even with that small hole away from mouth. Once fully charged, it lasts a long time when using it for stereo music streaming.Pros: Sound quality is great, as being a bluetooth headphone. Battery lasts long enough. The microphone does pick up sound perfectly.Cons: Feel a little pinched above ears after wearing it for a while. It would be great if the belt is expandable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had these for a while and liked them.  If I wear them for more than 30 minutes, the top of my ears against my head hurt.  I was willing to put up with that because I liked the wireless aspect, and they sounded good.  The ear cushion is great, it's just the weight pushing the rubber shark fin piece against your ears that hurts after a while.Recently I laid them down at work over the weekend.  I guess I laid them down incorrectly, because they are now misshapen.  Once that happens, you are out of luck.  They will no longer fit against your ears.So they sound great, but no longer fit.  I think the ear pieces are just too heavy and it relies on the plastic head/neck band piece to maintain an exact shape.Anyway, I am disappointed and will not buy this model again."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have had this phone for two months now and it is the best one I have owned,I have had three razr's and many other so called cutting edge phones even the V3i and none are as good as this,as for the pebl it is simple to open unless you are a butter fingered fool,and as for the finish wearing off on the keypad well mine is just fine.The phone is made better than the flimsey Razr is,you want a quality phone that works as well as it looks get this phone,you want cheap made buy something else."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Given the other reviews here, decided that getting two batteries would be smart due to the freshness issue, in case the first one didn't last as long.  (My original battery was worn out.)  It's been a couple months now and the first battery is still going strong where before I needed to have the charger with me to finish my calls.  Price was a major factor here compared to retail and I wanted to wait a few months before considering a new phone.  The much lower price made this plan easier, giving me plenty of time to consider the next generation of Razr.  And if these batteries quickly died in the short-term then I didn't lose that much in the deal."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The batteries were exactly as advertised, they were delivered in a normal timeframe, there were no issues or hiccups or drama with the vendor.  It was \"slam, bam, thank you, sirs or madams.\"  Battery life is really subjective as everyone's \"normal\" is different.  But life is definitely restored compared to my original 2 year old battery.  My experience is use of Bluetooth really drains batteries quickly.  But that's a Bluetooth issue that goes away if you don't use Bluetooth.  I have no complaints at all with this product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this headset for about a year now; I use it with a Razr.  It's a fine headset from a technical perspective: the sound is fine, it's easy to pair and use, etc.  I haven't run into any problems using it in a car, or out of doors.However, it's really not very comfortable: the hook that goes over the ear is just a bit too stiff and edgy, I wouldn't want to wear it for a long call (more than 15-20min say).For comfort and performance, consider the Plantronics Voyager 510 (around $50 at Amazon); I've had one of those (now used by my son), and it is excellent.  If you're into new gadgets, check out the Jawbone sets -- I haven't used one, but a colleague swears by the one he's been using for a couple of months."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought the SLVR for my wife and a RAZR for my self. People who want iTunes should buy their phones through a service provider who includes it on the phone. Our unlocked SLVR (apparently produced for use in Europe...it came with European plug and a US adapter)did not come with iTunes. Having read the reviews I expected this. My wife uses her phone primarily for talking and text messaging. The SLVR has worked well for this. The only issue is that some of the shortcuts don't work. The main one missing is the one which you use to lock your keypad so that buttons are not accidently pressed. We get this message saying shortcut not available on this phone. Other than this small annoyance my wife and I really like the phone. We're living in Hungary right now and the SLVR is not sold here, so it's extra cool for others to see. The small, thin form factor is great. I'm almost tempted to get one of these to replace my RAZR!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The case is easy to use and hold securely to my belt or waistband. My phone is easy to put in and get out when I want it out, but remains secure when I don't need it.The only problem I had is with the belt clip.  It came to me with a fine leather covering over the belt clip.  The belt clip is very tight, and the second time I put it on my belt, the leather covering it tore and came off.  It really didn't affect the functioning at all, but I was annoyed that something I just purchased came apart on the second use."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is almost perfect for my Palm Treo 700.  The fit is great.  The leather is soft and of very high quality.  The magnetic closure is the best I've seen, with no alignment required yet very secure.  The one exception is the belt clip.  It takes three men and a dog to get it on or off the belt!  It is so tight that I think you could tear the case getting it on or off unless you pry it off with something like a pen.  I don't know what they were thinking putting such a tight clip on such a great case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The only thing that I can add to the the reviews already posted on this device is my own experiences - we ordered 2 of the 'bulk packaged' bundles which include the headset and the charger.Positives:- No earbud going into the ear - this is a BIG positive because I can't stand those and, apparently they are not good for you.- Quick charging.- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry.- Easy to turn on/off, by simply folding/unfolding the microphone boom.- Pretty good instructions.Negatives:- My wife complains that the sound quality is not always perfect.- Being as small as it is, perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.At this time, my wife decided to keep hers but she will give the second one to her girlfriend as a birthday present :)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a good blue tooth. I can hear great with this product. My husband had a problem with it, that is wasn't load enough for him. He drives truck. Just a little bulky for my taste. This is the first blue tooth I had when I got my first blue tooth compatible phone. Had lots of them.The only draw back is. They only lasted about six months and we had to get new one. And the product does pick up allot of background noise. But it does work well. Would recommend this to others."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've owned two of these. It is great that it rests against your ear, and is very comfortable not having an earpiece sticking in your ear. The first one I owned, after a month, lost most of its volume. I could not make the volume louder via the volume control; the volume control actually never seemed to work, but at least at first the volume was real good...for about a month. The second one I bought lasted about 9 months, but now the button to answer or hang up on a call does not work."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this product for a dive trip to Fiji. While in Fiji I decided to take a kayak out with my camera inside this 'waterproof' case. The case was sitting between my legs and during the trip out it slid into some water. The water was maybe 2&#34; deep. It didn't even completely submerge the case. Once I was out a ways I wanted to take a picture of the resort. When I lifted the case I knew there was an issue right away when water came pouring out.My camera was ruined on the 2nd day of my 10-day vacation. There is no place to find another camera. I would have been better off putting the camera in my pocket than this case.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is mega study. I bought this because I go kayaking with my dad.The case is big enough to fit my IPhone and IPod in their perfectly (with their protective cases), without them moving around in there.Length wise, for just storing those 2 items it's a bit big, but at the same time its not big enough for me to squeeze my wallet in there as well.Size wise, I would have preferred a little smaller to perfectly fit the phones, or a bit longer to fit something else in there as well.That's my fault though. You can read about the sizes but I never seem to picture it right until I have the product sitting right in front of me.But it gets the job done. I recommend."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have had this phone for almost a year now. I have not had any major issues. Though a little slippery to hold. The bad part about the keyboard is that you have to use two hands for it. I have been reading about people losing their stylus', I haven't had that problem so far. I have added a 2GB mini SD card for my tunes. Although this phone does not like Macs, it is a good windows device which requires occasional reset. A built-in task manager would help."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I like my phone i got it the first day it came out and when i got it i mean it takes some getting use to but I like the features, the camera, the phone is ok not wow, love the keyboard, and i really like my windows media player on it and all the things you can do. I don't know what most people were expecting but i think my expection of the phone is what i expected....Until someone finds the perfect phone that has no problems, have everything you ever wanted, absolutely no issue with it and it does every possible thing, then you let me know but for now this phone is ok/good"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The price I paid for this package was good, but the cost of shipping negated the low price. I had seen lower price from other web retailer, $8 with free shipping. Most advertizements online include just one cable. This phone tool package has two cables, one for mini-USB and one for other non-mimi-USB phones. I guess the extra cable is worth a few dollars. The software does not have much on it, but you need it to manage your phone book on your cell phone and to make your own mp3 ring tones and upload to it. Other phone maker like Samsung, you can download similar utilities for free from their website."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have had a few of these (broke them, totally my fault) and I use them with the adapter for my Android phone. I am very sensitive about clients and calls with press people hearing me clearly, easily and consistently. I take this headset and the sister 3-in-1 version any day over several bluetooth headsets I have purchased over the years. I know its an older product, but it works extremely well. If they made them out of Titanium, I would buy it at almost any price because I have trashed (again, my fault, dog ate one, I crushed the other) two of them. Thankfully they are inexpensive."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought a Plantronics bluetooth headsetPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headsetfor the car and was extremely happy with it. I wanted to leave it in the car, though, because I knew if I took it with me when I got out, I would never remember to put it back in the car.  I decided to get a wired headset to keep in my briefcase because, despite being very technically literate, I'm still leary about something emitting radio waves stuck in my ear all day.  The MX505 has been great.  Most importantly, it's durable.  It also has good sound quality and the people I call have no trouble hearing me."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The C139 is the cheapest model in Tracfone's lineup.  It's a very good basic phone that gives you good voice clarity and easy text messaging.  Because Tracfone doesn't have a lot of services to offer (which isn't a bad thing for people who only want basic cellular service), this phone doesn't give you music downloads or live TV (which on other carriers are mostly misleading hype anyway).  The color screen is small but good-quality.  The only thing I don't like is Tracfone's 60-day refill polic: you must refill every 60 days to keep your account active; otherwise you forfeit your number and balance.  Other prepaid providers like Speak Out Wireless (from 7-Eleven) give you one full year of usage."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "If you have a child who you want to carry a cell phone, but don't want to pay lots of money for all of the extras (or if you yourself just want a \"basic\" phone), this is a good value for the money.  Large screen displays numbers very clearly.  Sound quality is good.  Battery life is a little short and the phone cannot be used while it is charging (that's a pretty big negative, IMO).  But overall, this is a good starter phone and serves the purpose.  If you just want a dependable phone to carry with you in case of emergencies, this phone fits the bill nicely."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this thing for years now, and use it all the time. At one point I went to plug my USB cord in without looking and totally smashed the internal stuff up inside the top! I thought it was broken, however after finding something small to push the innerds back down to where the cord would once again fit inside, it's worked just fine. Never cuts out or anything. I still have to be careful, otherwise I'll push the internal casing back upwards - I'm sure I broke some little stabilizer - but I can get it back down easily. I'm impressed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "While fishing I'd used an identical but &#34;brand name&#34; dry pak that was loaned by a friend. The Kwik Tek is, as I said identical, but a good bit cheaper. Waterproof and mudproof protection for my iPhone that I've used fishing and working outside in damp, muddy conditions. Some padding provides additional protection from drops and bumps. Should float with most devices, especially if you leave some air inside. Except for the camera, phone and apps are fully functional although I prefer to remove it for talking. Lanyard provides a bit of extra security that I haven't yet needed but will when kayaking. Between uses to assure inside is totally dry, it is a good idea to prop open to air or drop in one of those silica packs. Guess you could get some protection from a baggie, but at this low price the Kwik Tek is cheap insurance for your phone and priceless data."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This cable functions fine (at first), but it probably won't hold up to everyday use.  I've inserted mine maybe 20 times, and one of the spring-loaded contacts just became permanently stuck, making the cable worthless.  Sure it's dirt cheap, which is nice compared to the expensive real Nokia cable, but with what these accessory vendors charge for shipping, I'd recommend ordering several of these at one time from a source with a good deal on multiple items.  I'm now trying to decide whether to do that myself or shell out for the real deal with a real warranty."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This device is a small attachment for any of the Navigon 2100, 5100 or 7100 series GPS.For some reason, Navigon decided to place the charger receptacle on the BOTTOM (facing downwards) of their units. This makes little difference if you use the windshield suction cup to hold and display your unit. However, if you use the adhesive disc for the dash then the charger cord will likely have to be bent at right angles to make the connection, as its receptacle on the GPS points straight down. This device, when attached to the GPS, allows allows the charger cord to come in from the side, eliminating any acute bending of the cord.Conclusion:A helpful device for all Navigon GPS units; intend for those users who wish to have their unit mounted to the dash. 5 Stars"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I use this transmitter on the back of my tv with my Bluetooth headphones. It works perfectly for my purpose and the battery lasts pretty long, given the size of this thing. It's really small, smaller than a matchbox even. Charges up in about 2 hours and will go for a couple weeks, with an hour or two of use per day. I did have some problems trying to get this thing to pair, it's looks as if there are no buttons, don't worry, it's there. The light is also the button, on the opposite side of the USB charging port, and the audio cable. Once you play with this thing for a little while will make you a pro at it. Then you'll have no problems. I definitely recommend this little transmitter."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Very convenient product to have that allows for easy movement from one vehicle to the next.  The speaker quality is good and the ability to shift the microphone to a different angle is a nice touch.  I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't consistently automatically connect to the LG enV phone after pairing the two devices together.  Sometimes if I try to make a call via voice dial, it won't activate the phones voice dial feature like it should when I press the Answer/End button.  Overall the product is a good product, but LG enV buyers beware of the inconsistencies."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "As other reviews have said, this works quite well as a bluetooth speaker phone. However, the visor clip on mine kept slipping on the visor, resulting in the phone moving around.  When I moved the phone to the other end of the visor, hoping that being closer to the connection to the car instead of a snap that held it in place would result in less vibration and hence less motion, it failed to cover the road noise. I suspect this is more a problem with my car, in that the visor bounces more and is slippery, than with the speakerphone, but it stillwent back."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Nice slider phone, wanted a change from the bricks and flip phones.  Bluetooth is great, and the Samsung PC Suite (free download from Samsung) lets you edit your contacts, upload ringtones, and just about anything else you want to do.  Battery life is great, about one week between charges.  The speaker is not the greatest quality, so a headset is recommended.  Cingular did not bundle a headset, so that's extra.  Interface is intuitive and functions are easy to figure out.  Speakerphone sound quality is only marginal.The main selling point of the phone is its sliding and its thinness.  Other than that, it's basically like all other GSM phones.  There are cheaper flip phones that can also do video.I would have given this phone five stars if the sound quality was better."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the phone Cingular insurance replaced my Sony Ericsson W600i phone with.  Supposedly if they can't give you the same phone (which they couldn't because the W600i has been discontinued) they're supposed to replace it with something comparable.  There's about a $150 price difference between these two phones so I'm not sure how they figure these two are comparable but oh well.Cons: the speaker is way too quiet, the proprietary data cable is not included, the clear button is too close to the down arrow, and turning the volume up or down is annoying because it rings. I also have a glitch in my phone where it sometimes rings for no reason after adjusting the volume and the only way to get it to stop is to power off the phone.Pros: looks cool, slide function is fun, easy to use, stays locked, large display, lightweight, and slim.Bottom Line:  Would I buy it?  No."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After getting myself a new VX8700, I picked up a new VX8300 for my girlfriend. The VX8300 is not the prettiest or thinest phone Verizon offers, but it seems to be one of their best performers. Sound quality, speakerphone, RF, and battery life all seem very good. The camera takes decent pictures. It has just about all the features you expect in a phone today too. With a new contract, you can get it for $50 or less. At this price, I give it 5 stars."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The headset works pretty well with my treo 755p. In fact, it's the best headset I've found for the treo (tried plantronics and motorola previously without success). However, the ear hooks were missing from the package and Samsung customer service wouldn't even speak to me without me providing my phone's ESN numbers. WTH? I also attempted to make a request on Samsung's service website, which also would not function correctly. I called Amazon CS and they sent a replacement after 4 minutes on the phone. AWESOME!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The WEP200 sounds pretty good, is easy to use and is pleasantly small, but the system for keeping it in the ear is nearly useless. It comes with three different sizes of these little rubber loop things that are supposed to create enough pressure and friction on the inside of the auricle to keep the device in place, but none of them would keep the little thing in my ear, it would always fall out.It comes with nice a little case that also serves as the charger.  However, this device also a little bit overpriced. So, on to the next one."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This was a very nice bluetooth headset until I lost it. since it so small, I tuck it away and now I can't find it ;(. anyways, I had 2 great headset by Plantronics and samsung. both are very good, but if I had to choose, I would choose Samsung for it connects to my phone without too much hassle compare to plantronics 510 voyager, where I had to constantly reset my phone to get connect it. on the other hand Plantronics Voyager 510 voice is far superior to Samsungs (IMO)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this headset on the recommendation of a very picky friend, so I figured it would be great. Wrong. The ear loop is cumbersome to put on, and the ear bud by itself will not stay in my average ear. Worse, you have to place the headset in a recharging box (???? What happened to a simple plug??), meaning that the ear loop needs to come off. A Jabra ear gel fits on the unit . . . but the ear piece needs to come off to recharge. The nail in the coffin is that the ear piece volume is terribly low, necessitating a constant shove of a finger to ensure no aural leakage, even in my ultra-quiet Toyota Sequoia. To be fair, the sound quality was reported to to be very good, but the drawbacks far outweigh the pluses."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really like this inexpensive lightweight bluetooth headset!  Works well on my end, but sometimes the person on the other end of the call hears an echo.  Stays in my ear great without the clip that goes around your ear.  It charges up in a protective flip top box, so the headset doesn't have to plug directly into wall charger.  I store my headset in the small charging box and carry it in the small box in my pocket when not in use.  I love it that this was only $18!!!  Can't beat that price!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I would have given this a 5-star if it was only a clip/wired BT headset. It works flawlessly when used in that configuration. When you use it as an in-ear only headset, there is a tiny (barely noticeable, but there) amount of static. The person on the other end never complains. I do like the fact that for $20 you can convert it into to different styles.Two suggestions:1) I STRONGLY suggest using the included ear foam in either configuration. This makes the unit fit tighter and reduces background noise. This way you can turn down the volume a bit and the sound is clearer.2) Tinker with the volume on your phone AND the headset. You need to find the sweet spot for this to really sound good. Once you do, you'll be happy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Well, I went ahead and bought this at the reduced price. It was good at first and then other people were having problems hearing me and I was misunderstood because of this headset. Thankfully, it wasn't one of my important calls and just resulted in a bit of confusion between that person and me. I am returning this product because it is just not worth it to me if the other person cannot hear me properly. I do like the design of it and the fact that you get to choose how you place it in your ear. I don't care about it otherwise."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love this headset for the money! I've been using it for a couple years now and I don't know how I ever lived without it. I have gotten my money's worth a hundred times over. I find it comfortable enough that I forget I'm even wearing it. I have some issues with clarity in a few spots, but if I hold my phone closer to the headset in the fuzzy spots, it's okay... and that's not in a lot of places, just happens once in a while. It's easy to pair with any phone too. I used to have a motorola and recently switched to a Samsung. It paired up with no problem. I recommend this product. It's a great place to start if you're looking for your first bluetooth."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After a small amount of screwing around the H500 connected with myNokia N75 without a hitch.  I find that if you firmly place the earloop around the base of the ear and then fold in the receiver in fitsfirmly and doesn't come loose.  I agree that the volume could go higher;however, in a quiet room it is adequate.  I'm told that I'm clearlyheard on the other end of the connection.  This is also in a quiet room.Small and lite.  I think this a rather nifty piece of gear."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really like the design but keep in mind you are sacrificing protection for aesthetics. It really only covers the back of the phone which in my opinion is the least important part. The screen is largely unprotected except for a slight lip around the edge which may or may not protect the screen but I have yet to drop it.You really have to press fairly hard on the buttons to elicit a response which gets annoying after a while. I solved this by cutting the button part out with an exacto knife.I have a otterbox style case for this as well but it adds too much bulk to an already large phone so this is my go-to case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case is made of a firmer material than the silicone cases, which is perfect because it doesn't stretch or get caught when going in or out of a pocket or case.  It hugs the phone tight enough that many people won't know you have a case on it.  At first I thought the case was making button use difficult, but then I took the case off and realized the Galaxy Note buttons are terrible even without a case.  It's not much more difficult with the case on, and you do get used to it.  The textured grip area on the sides is a nice tough as well."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have owned many phones over the years and a lot of expensive cases.This by far is the best case I have come across. It does not add any bulk to the phone and the pure comfort of holding it in the hand is speechless. The embossed sides , the nice rubbery feel gives good comfort and it's not a dust magnet.I only ordered this case because the the one that I had did not protect the corners of the phone when dropped. I will definitely keep this brand in mind in the future. It's that good and I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants good protection, comfort and style. Thank you BoxWave..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm using this case with the AT&T version of the Note. It gets 5 stars for the high quality/price ratio. The material is soft and flexible, the cut-outs line up ok... not perfect, but they don't cause any functionality issues. I love the textured hand grips on the sides. The hard buttons require a little more pressure to push, but i prefer to have the covered over having them open, but recessed under the case. The s-pen opening is fine with my case, I have no problem getting it out. It does make the Note feel noticeably heavier than the naked phone, but there is a lot of area to cover on the note. It's not a perfect case, but I've paid $30 on cases for other \"iDevices\" that had similar issues. Boxwave shipped pretty quickly, but there was no tracking available."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Pros:  Works as it should. Easy connection to the phone.  Good talk time. Comfortable fit on the ear.  Easy to use.One Con: I could use this headset without any problems. My wife would get bad echo issues where the person she was talking with heard themselves as an echo.  Guess it has to do with the fit to the ear.  In my case the path from the earpiece to the mike was blocked but open in her case.  She had the same issue with a Motorola H500 earpiece and i can use the same Motorola earpiece fine.Purchased a Plantronics 510 which works for her.  No reports of echo from the person she is talking with."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Product came without shipping slip, no protective packaging. .Bluetooth was placed in a plastic bag, slipped in an envelope and mailed.  Quality is very poor.  Crackling, buzzing muffled sounds very annoying and diapointing to recieve something you are expecting to use all the time to not being able to use it.  I would not recomend this vendor to anyone.  Description stated very clearly that it would be packaged in retai packaged and pictured with extra items.  This came with bluetooth only and charge cord; no instruction or any other accessories with this."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently, which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous. I could have bought a 520 for $2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really don't have a lot of time. That is why I shop online, So if I'm purchasing an item that is to be used to make life more convenient, like a Bluetooth headset, it really is obnoxious to receive one that is &#34;worse than sucks&#34;. This item did not even charge. Plantronics really needs to pull this item because it is really damaging to their reputation to have this out there for sale. I choose Plantronics because as a Regional Sales Manager/Road Warrior, I've always had luck with Plantronics. Too bad that this one was a lemon."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It's a fairly good headset. Negatives: does a poor job of screening out wind noise & other noises; when I make a 2nd call, it doesn't always find the phone & I have to punch a few buttons to get it working again.Positives: very comfortable - I forget I have it on; fairly discreet looking; battery life is very good; hooks up to my phone (Treo 700p) seamlessly - I very rarely have to pair it up again; I can hear very well, even in my noisy diesel pickup!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The Explorer 350 is simple to set up and use.  Here's my lowdown:Positive:- easy set up and use- good sound- balances well on the ear and easy to put on- nice options charging in car or via a USB port- nice options for mounting it in the car- nice phone ringing tone in the earpieceNegatives:- no built-in mute function (that I can find)- if you want to recharge via outlet, you have to purchase a chargerThis is my second Plantronics bluetooth headset.  The first (Voyager) had all the bells as whistles, but the buttons were very small and the volume button broke when I dropped it on a tile floor.  This one is easier to adjust on the fly but you have to be willing to live with no mute."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have never been up with technology.  My friend always had music on his phone and was listening to it all the time.  I wanted to do the same.  Going into this not sure I came out very pleased.  I have a M520 phone and I listen to music all the time now.  It has loud speakers and eliminates background noises.  I haven't quite figured out how to answer the calls because when I hit the button on he headphones my phone freezes up.  I really enjoy them."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This was worth the price,earpiece volume is great, no problem hearing incoming voice.  The only problem is that the mic is so far away from my mouth (as a result of such a compact product), that in order to have good voice transmission, I must hold my hand up and \"cup\" it from the corner of my mouth to the earpiece so my voice can be heard clearly.  This product would be perfect if it the mic portion extended a couple inches further towards the mouth."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I was concerned after ordering this device, when I read many reviews that said this device was a cheap piece of plastic that didn't fit into their ear properly. When I opened the packaged and first put it in my ear, I thought \"oh no - they were right!\"But I then read the manual and after adjusting the \"ear loop\" and angling the headset slightly downward, it fit perfectly into my ear! It's snug, it doesn't flop around at all. It fits in a different way from your traditional \"ear plug\" device but in many ways it's more comfortable because it's not sitting in your outer ear canal but slightly further outside.So if you're thinking about ordering this device, I'd recommend buying it. Just spend a little time getting the fit right and read the manual about how to adjust the ear loop which makes a huge difference.(Functionally the product paired with my Cingular Hermes 8525 phone perfectly - sound quality is fine)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "What can you say. It's a genuine Nokia car charger. It's high quality. It's cheap, and it works. Bought one for myself. Bought one for my girlfriend. Bought another one for my girlfriend when her rabbit chewed up the first one. They all worked great.A friend of mine bought some no-name brand from a big box store. Paid more and it doesn't work as well. The no-name crapper charges so slow you'd have to drive around all day to charge your phone. If you are using the GPS feature while plugged into that one your battery still gets drained.No such problems with the Nokia DC-4. It charges fast, and will continue to charge even when using power hungry applications.EDIT: Note that this 2mm coax style charger will charge your device faster than the DC-6 Micro USB version (890 mAh vs. 500)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Picked this up from Radio Shack as a novelty item.  The phone is thin, but the call quality is quite poor.  Virgin Mobile uses Sprint's PCS network, and Sprint is my primary provider (I have a new Sanyo M1 phone), and the call quality difference is huge.  The keypad is also uncomfortable to use, like many ultra-thin phones -- just not designed for normal human beings IMHO.  Finally, VM's prepaid rate is just too high.  Coupled with limited coverage, I'd say VM's service is a bad deal."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love this device - it's the only one that allows you to plug in your own headset. And I am VERY HAPPY to report that it works perfectly with the Verizon XV6800 Smartphone (also known as the HTC 6800 or Mogul 6800 on Sprint). No one reviewing here had tried it with this device, but I wanted the functionality so I took a chance and ordered it anyway. It works perfectly! (Or what I've tried so far works perfectly - I haven't received any phone calls while listening to music yet.)Note that I'm running Windows Mobile 6.1. I think it may not work for devices running WM 6.0. The audio jack functionality was altered with the OS upgrade. It may work, though - can't say for sure. It's worth trying!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a nice concept.  It allows the holster to orient either horizontal or vertically.  The only problem is that the first one I got...the clip snapped the first day I wore it.  The replacement is holding up much better, but it's gotten a bit floppy.  It would probably work fine for someone who was more sedentary...but I'm very active and put a lot of stress on stuff.  Still, I have it, and use it from time to time when I want to impress someone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've found that these are by far the best method for clipping my phone to my belt, I've used others many more expensive but always come back to one of these because of their built in kickstand and ability to easily and quickly slide the phone out.They're cheap yes but I've never had any problems with durability except after a long time of use, much longer you would expect such a cheap piece of plastic to last, that and on the ones with the kickstands like this that locking mechanism eventually wears out but the whole thing is easily replaceable.I have at times knocked the phone out my holster when bumping up against something but that is the tradeoff you pay for not having a lock obstructing your access to the device."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this for my dad. So far he likes it very much. Good price for what you get and so far (3 days) it hasn't broken or dropped the phone. The holster is secure and the clip has a groove so that the holster will not fly off your belt if you are running.UPDATE:At first the holster is great because it grips onto the phone. However, after sliding it out multiple times, it becomes loose and is easily removed. My dad was just walking and I guess the holster was slanted downwards a bit and his phone fell out. When it fell out the case came off. If you put your phone in with the screen facing out, the holster has a better grip on it, but if you have the screen facing in, the phone is likely to come out.We are going to replace the holster with a leather pouch holster because this holster seems unreliable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased this case from my girlfriend and her new Samsung Galaxy S4.  She had been using an Otterbox Commuter but was dissatisfied with that case's bulk.  I'm a big fan of TPU cases, so I got her this one and she couldn't be happier with it.  It fits snugly, looks great, covers the buttons (big plus), and isn't so bulky.  While this case is not at all bulky, it still offers protection for the camera lens and screen by having tiny ridges surrounding those parts which keep them from coming into contact with the surface the rest of the phone is resting on.  The fact that this case is so inexpensive just adds to its otherwise perfect rating."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The mix of smooth and ridged surfaces is a nice touch aesthetically and it also helps to keep a nice grip as all smooth can be a bit slippery. The case fits like a glove and all the holes and cuts outs fit the various ports perfectly. The price on this item is hard to beat and it arrived quickly. I haven't tried it with any of the fun NFC features yet, but I'm not anticipating any problems.All in all, if you're looking for a nice, simple bumper case I suggest you look no further (assuming the price is still good)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Fits like a glove. Adds no bulk to the phone - my GS4 stays slim and light!The kickstand works, doesn't slide around, nice and firm. It clicks shut with two tiny tabs of plastic on either end of the kickstand, so I guess if over time those tabs break then it won't stay shut anymore. But for the moment, the tabs are really tiny and hopefully will not break anytime soon.The only downsides I can find are:a. hard to feel whether or not if you pressed the power/volume button or not, there's no tactile feedback when you push. They do work though.b. the screw(?) that holds the kickstand in place on the back of the case bulges out and makes the phone sit slightly lopsided when you put it on a flat surface facing upward. Not an issue for me, but didn't expect the screw to bulge out the way it does.Otherwise very satisfied."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this for hubby who works in a restaurant so having a thin profile case (to easily side in and out of the belt pouch) was a must. The stripes on the sides make it easier to hold onto. Soft tpu case slips right on and can easily removed again for washing. Good price too.The only downside about this case (and might not be for some people) is that because the camera lens on the back of the S4 protrudes a little, you should use a case that is a little thicker on the back to better protect the lens from scratches. This case was a bit thin in my opinion. Why Samsung designed this phone this way is a mystery."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The case feels good in your hands and it won't slip out of your hands. I've docked a couple of stars is that in the image, it looks like the buttons would be easy to press, however, that is not the case. The buttons are very flush with the case, which makes it hard to actually use the buttons. I literally have to sometimes use two hands to push a button. If only the buttons extended outward, this would be a good case. For now, I will keep this as a backup."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "First off, I ordered the BoxWave Simple Element Gray Semi-transparent case I had to point this our since there's only one review section for multiple cases.This case is billiant, it feels well, it has a better grip than a naked S4. It's really god that you can still see the samsung logo on the back thanks to the frosted plastic semi-transparent design but it doesn't get scrached up easily like a completely clear case.So, now for the important bit, cases are supposed to protrect your phone and this case definitely does that and it does it quite well. The one-piece hybrid design provides a very good protection to the frame against drops and the lay on thr table desgin also provides screen protection.Port access is good, I had no problem using the original Samsung equipment and a couple of other headphones.The ONLY drawback for me. Power and volume buttons don't provide a great tactile feedback when pressed with this case so this is why I'll shave a star from the rating."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Shows up totally deformed (top of the case doesn't even touch the phone because it was cast crooked), and I have to pay to mail it back to them if I want a replacement? I don't want a replacement anymore, I want a functional phone case. Definitely a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; kind of thing. The case is pretty inflexible, so when I took the case off, it also pulled off the back of the phone. Not the end of the world, but definitely a crappy case. Would absolutely not recommend."}

Great coverage of back and sides for protection, cut outs line up perfect.2. Pretty thin, doesn&#8217;t add much bulk.3. Glossy sides add a little better grip.Cons:1. Made my screen protector bubble up on sides2. Very slippery on back but glossy bumper on the sides, helps make grip better, could be better.3.

{"label": 7, "raw": "Nothing flashy about this case.  It's basic black, but the good thing is, it's matte on the backside.  Around the edges it's more shiny, which makes it more grippy.  I like that the volume and on/off buttons are covered to keep dust out, but the covering does make the buttons harder to push.  Cutouts are good, not quite perfect, but you'd have to be OCD to notice.  Seems to be secure, probably would not come off your phone inadvertently.BTW, the blackout case is completely opaque.  The blue Arctic Frost Crystal Slip case is identical to it other than being blue and transparent.Right now, there are a few different prices listed for these.  For me, the actual cost with shipping was around $3, so it's definitely worth that."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I ordered the Blackout and the Airwave (also by BoxWave) because I could not decide which one I wanted. They both fit my Galaxy S4 just right, nice and snug. They are not bulky which I like. They are not rigid plastic, both are flexible (but not flimsy) but the Blackout case is a little more flexible than the Airwave. These cases cover a little more of the front of the phone than the other case I was using which is nice because it covers the side edges of my screen protector, Tech Armor Ballistic Glass, but without interfering with the viewing area of the screen. By the way it fits great with that screen protector so I don't think anyone would have any problems with other screen protectors as this one is a little thick since it is glass.  You do have to push a little harder for the side buttons but that does not bother me. All openings on the case line up perfectly."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this case because it was very cheap.  I should have known it was not worth it.  The case fit is too tight.  When I put it on my phone, the lip that goes around the front of the phone was uneven.  No matter how many times I tried to take it off and put it back on again, the lip was just uneven.  This caused my screen protector film to be displaced by this case.  It was much more of a pain than a help.  Get the real Samsung case and save yourself the headache."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Beautifully designed case.  It provides great TPU protection without adding bulk to the phone.  It fits great, nice and snug so you don't have to worry about it ever coming off on its own, while still able to remove if needed.  The color is stunning on the black phone, a nice deep jewel tone.  The sides provide nice grip, and I love the matte back.  The only issue is how difficult the power and volume buttons are to press, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.  I would buy more if it came in more colors."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Even though I am not a fan of cases I still try them to see what are good and if I can come to keeping one....my preference still says no to cases but that's a gamble I take again, since dropping my S4 before andresulted in my screen breaking...that could of been avoided if i had a case on it.Slowly my trust and confidence in not dropping my phone has gone back up...but I'm taking risks and youshould protect yourself from having a broken or damaged phone.The case is pretty much all clear except the back is a matt white finish. Gives it a bit of a cool edge to it.The case is a bit too snug and a bit molded fatter on some parts of the trimming but the entire phoneis covered fine with the case. If I dropped it, I believe it will be saved but every drop is risky regardless..."}

It is not, so why spend more money for nothing special. If you are going to spend this type of money, you better get something for it.Go and check the Ballistic SG caseBallistic SG0867-M385 Soft Gel Case for Samsung Galaxy Note - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black Silicone/Black TPU/White PCfor the Galaxy Note to see what a proper case should be like; or just get that cheapo TPU case.Boxwave is just fleecing customers with this overpriced case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This case has a perfect snug fit. I had first tried the Dzitronic case which was very good, and seemed to be slightly thicker, and felt slightly heavier, but offered great protection. This case is more convenient for daily use since it is lightweight, and offers good protection. Judging from the thickness of the Dzitronic case cover.. it might be a better protector in case of accidental drops, but this boxwave case is looks better, feels better, and has a better fit although it is thinner and lighter."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The product is as advertised - a genuine OEM Motorola battery. It looks exactly the same as the original battery that came with the phone. So it's not a generic brand. Works great too. Somehow the package got lost in the mail (or the seller forgot to send it?). But after I contacted the seller a replacement arrived within the next few days. Though the package looked beat-up or had been in the ditch the content was intact. Great and speedy customer care to make up for a mistake."}

Yeah, and it's a penny, PLUS a lot in shipping!So, if the software works for you, it is pretty nice.  If not, you're out.

Use every inch of the 50' cable supplied.My installation is in a steel-framed and steel-skinned building -- getting a signal inside was basically impossible. The outside antenna is on an old TV antenna mast 5' above the building roof, and the inside unit is sitting on top of a suspended ceiling in the center of the main area. Now I get 5-bars on Sprint anywhere inside the building, and 3-4 bars within 10 feet or so of the building outside. Our ATT data card gets a 5-bars signal also.

The battery also has a good life and he needs it as some days are long ones for him.The sound quality is good and he can hear the caller clearly and we can hear him well.  The price we paid was a lot less that the $40 they are asking here.  I only mention this as he goes through Bluetooth ear pieces quite frequently from daily use, to breaking them to simply losing them.We gave him a really good stereo set that he uses at home and to listen books and music but he uses the lower priced ones while he is on the road.

These chargers will add a couple hours of talk time but not fully charge your phone.

A big plus is that you can use it as a passive headset by plugging in a 3.5 mm audio cable. It's a good idea to purchase the carrying case to protect it while transporting or storing."}

You can use the same USB power cord as for your phone (if its a MOTO RAZR model NOT the new V9). I take this for short trips in town. Sadly to say it will be used as a Back up due to being replaced by the MOTOROKR T505. If you are leary about trying this...JUST DO IT. If you dont like it Amazon will take it back.

I read some of the minor complaints about this product in the other reviews and utterly ridiculous. The on/off button is small but who cares?

It's small and easy to put in a pocket or purse, and is very convenient. When I got my Razr, my son got my old Chocolate Touch, so I gave him the headset also and he uses it all of the time.

Should protect well if it gets dropped.Both sides are the same so the scanner can go into either side and the cable into the other.  The scanner is slightly higher than one side of the case.  There's a padded flap in between the halves of the case that pushes into the other half a bit.  That compresses the cable in the other side and makes it so nothing moves around.Functionally, that's a great design, but for looks I would have liked the scanner to fit completely into the bottom, with a thinner top half for the cable.  As it stands I might be able to get a couple other cables or things into the top part so it's probably a net plus."}

I tried rolling the protector on as slow as possible while rubbing from center out with a microfiber cloth. After application, and only rubbing the protector with microfiber, it was scratched past the point of no return. I cannot imagine what this screen protector would look like after a few days of use.Although this product may protect the screen, after a couple of days use you probably won't be able to see the screen with all the accumulated scratches. The users guide says for best results to replace monthly. After initial application I removed it and threw it away.Waste of money."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "At less than a dollar per sheet, you can afford to treat them as disposable and not be too upset if they fall off or lose their ability to stay on that long. What sells the screen protectors for me is that they come with a grid on the backing so you can easily measure and quickly cut to match the size of the LCD you're protecting. If you want something more permanent, then go with Invisible Shield or Best Skins Ever. But for the price and their versatility, they're well worth it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "use on 2cameras and cell phone.  The cutting is fairly straight forward, but the pre-cut edge that is supposed to help with seperating the backing from the protector is not cut well so i've wasted one sheet as it ripped easily while taking off the backing.  material not durable at all.  Got scratches just by using the squeegy in the package.  Lastly, if you had to reposition it, good luck getting the bubbles (hazyness) out.  Requires too much effort to get it right.  Would not recommand it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "You can use this product to cut a high quality screen protector for anything with a touchscreen. That's awesome. Keep in mind that you have to cut and apply the screen protector yourself. It took me a few applications before I got good at it. Some air bubbles are normal, they dissipate after a few days. Lots of air bubbles means you are doing it wrong. Practice makes perfect.  You get 10 screen protectors for about $10.00 (or whatever they are selling it for) and the sheets they give you are pretty large. I think this is product is a very good value."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "These are easy to use and provide short-term effective protection for device screens.  The plastic is soft and scratches easily, but is easily replaced with a fresh piece...I find that it lasts about a month (in my pocket, exposed to my keys and other crud) before the scratches become totally obnoxious.  The used plastic peels off easily, without leaving any residue behind.Incidentally, cutting these to size is simple.  The backing material is printed with a grid to act as a guide. I'm straight-line impaired and can almost get it right.Note...these are packaged 12 in a plastic bag.  When I last looked, they were much cheaper than the precut protectors designed for a specific cell phone."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I thought this item was a good idea as it gives you the opportunity to mount your phone closer to the seat instead of up on the windshield.  I discovered 2 things:1) The unit itself is very cheap.  The adjustable arm used to clamp your phone has a major weak spot.  Mine broke right out of the package.  I made some repairs to strengthen it, but first use showed that this device does not work well with any smart phones.  I have an iPhone, and it's too wide and tall for this device.  You can't clamp your phone very well because of the cheap design, and the bottom ledge is too small.  After 5 minutes of driving, I had to remove my phone before it fell out.This is a good idea that was implemented poorly."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Mobile service providers claim that this type of antenna does not work, and I have to agree with them.  Installing it actually reduced my reception from 2 bars to NO bars!  If you search the internet, you will find that passive antennas like this are no different than that battery compartment sticker that claimed to improve cell phone reception, block radio waves from frying your brain, etc.  It doesn't work and it's a waste of money.I recommend buying a wired antenna that directly connects to your phone.  If you phone doesn't have such a connection, then you may want to look into a different phone because nothing without a direct connection is going to work, and you may want to look into a phone that gets better reception (there are some -- just read the 3rd party reviews).I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you just have money to burn.  If so, please just send it to my PayPal account instead."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Had zero effect. My windows must already allow enough signal through for this to not make a difference. Bought it for the back of my place because I get full bars right outside on the patio, and almost none inside (I live in a concrete apartment). If I put the phone in the same place I had this, I get good reception, but this didn't extend my signal any, or act as a repeater. Didn't seem to help in the car either, but I don't really need it there."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "There are a few spots around town where my calls get dropped when I use my cellular phone while driving in the car.  These areas are very small, only about 300 feet long.  And if I hold the phone outside the car when I drive through these areas, the calls don't drop.I bought this device with the hope that it would allow me to keep calls going without rolling down the windows.  Unfortunately, I found absolutely NO difference between calls being dropped with and without this device.When I took the device off, it broke open and I took both sides apart.  I didn't find any evidence of components that will inductively couple the antenna and the interior components.However, when it was installed, it did **look** impressive.  So, if you want a fake cellular antenna to make your car look \"cool,\" this will fit the bill perfectly.  If you want a performance improvement, consider one of the Wilson cellular repeaters instead."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this case because of the descriptions and the price. I have a white HTC One and it really looked good on it and didn't add much bulk or weight to the phone. I tried to take it 1 step too far and remove the plastic back to make it a bumper (since that was I was looking for anyway) but it's not firm enough to be a bumper. If you're happy with the looks and don't destroy it like I did, you'll live this one. I'm still using it as a bumper but did order the clear version of this same make/model."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I really like this case. I got the Frosted version, and I kind of wish I got the BodySuit or something else because the Frosted feel is not my favorite. The case leaves a good lip around the screen and the TPU has a good thickness to it, without being too thick, so IA feel like this would protect my phone pretty well in a drop.My only complaint is that the volume buttons are subpar. It takes a very good push to get the buttons to work, and a lot of creaking goes on in the process with the TPU.Overall, though, this is a great case at an awesome price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Boxwave has done it again. This case is a fantastic case. I just received it so a 4 star rating for now till I have had it for a week or so but for 1.50 there is no way you can go wrong. From past expericence with Boxwave I can tell you I will be updating to a 5 star rating. The  grip is perfect,the fitting is perfect, the holes for all the external plugs and features are alighned perfect and 1.50 cost, well you dont need to figure that one out. Already purchased a back up one."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "One of the best cases I've ever bought for a phone.Very snug fit,w/o any pull-away around the cutouts for the I-R Blaster/3.5mm audio jack/USB port.The volume rocker is covered & actually functions better than w/o a case.The case looks & feels as if it is actually a part of the phone,yet,should provide more than adequate protection against everyday use & occasional misuse/accidental bumps/etc.....Also a great value,as I paid less than $5.00,definitely a must-buy for any HTC ONE owner."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am no expert on these headsets, this is the first one I have ever bought. That being said, I think this one is great. I have a Samsung phone and I was never really pleased with the way the mic picked up my voice and often people would complain of not being able to hear me but with this made my voice clear and understandable. I was worried of the background noise by the nature of the bluetooth but the AudioIQ seems to do an excellent job keeping the noise out, not sure how. It is simple to set up as well. Overall I am really pleased with this. Highly Recommended!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased Plantronics 665 headset to replace BlackBerry 655+ by Plantronics that went through washing machine (but surprisingly still worked fine after drying).  My wife also has one of these and she loves it.I like 665 as much as I like 655+.  The fit is comfortable and secure with the ear loop.  The sound quality is good on both ends. The battery life is sufficient for me I charge it once every two-three days.The only complaing is that the buttons are a bit hard to press.  When I push the main button the ear tip gets pushed into my ear which is not very pleasant.Overall, this is a great headset at a good price."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The earpieces don't go as far into the ear as my etymotic earlpugs, so I have to use the wire hook it came with to stabalize it.  I wish the in-ear part gripped my ear a little better.  Also, the hook falls off easily when it's in my pocket.  I wish there was a more permanent way to attach it.  Also, there are some CRAZY big ear gels in there.  I have big ears (har har) and I use the smallest one.  WHOS ears are big enough for the large attachments?Having said that, the headset is a winner.  It's LOUD!  I actually have to turn it down.  Reception is good and it pairs with my L2 quickly and easily.  No problems hearing other people or them hearing me.Last thing... it pairs up with my Mac G4 no problems.  System sounds go through it and that's pretty cool!I give it a 4 out of 5."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "So far the bluetooth is not quite as good as my stand-by Plantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging], of which I've bought two. I've been told that the bluetooth sounds as good on the other end as my Voyager 520, but from my end, it's not quite as good. The best part of this bluetooth is the vehicle power adapter. All of my other bluetooth earpieces have come with a desktop/wall charger, and the primary reason I ordered this is so I can charge it in my car. When the charger is fully extended and the bluetooth attached, it looks like a huge spy pen. For that reason alone, everyone who has seen has wanted to order one.This is so cheap, you can order it and keep it as a spare in your car since it's easy to charge and doesn't take up much more room that a big spy pen."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have owned 2 Plantronics headsets -- The 665 and its predecessor, the 655. Both have suffered the same fate. The little rubber ear tips are flimsy and keep breaking. When I pick up the headset, the ear tip falls out. I purchased the ear tip replacement pack, which costs about $10 and you get 3 ear tips -- 1 small, 1 medium, and 1 large. Given that I only have a need for 1 size, I basically had to pay $10 for one ear tip... which broke after 30 days. The headset sounds pretty good, fits in my ear OK, and people say they can hear me pretty well. Despite all of these positives, I will be replacing it with another brand."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My first impression is that whoever designed this product must have liked Kinder eggs when they were younger: everything involves assembly, and the car charger looks like something out of a Bond movie. Although I didn't have any issues with the call quality, the biggest problem was the plastic hoop that connect the headset to your ear - it's flimsy, breaks off easily in your pocket, and isn't particularly comfortable.It's definitely not bad for the price, but I don't think it stands up well to the Motorola range. If you spend a little more, you can get a little more comfort and considerably fewer attachments."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I guess it depends on your phone, even though this cable says it works with the shine, there is no shine driver on the cd. without the proper driver you cannot proceed. I don't think it's the cable at all, which is working very well at charging the phone. I did hunt around and downloads the drivers, the phone then shows up as removable f:...sometimes....but not in Windows Media Player and I could not get any music to transfer, I kept getting I/O device error.By the same token I got a Z9 and was able to easily connect and transfer using WMP.I bought a reader writer, and I was able to finally get music onto the shine. So just beware that the data cable is NOT working with all phone. It's all over the internet too."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The battery I received is not new...I thought I was buying a new battery but instead received a battery that is in no better condition than the one I am replacing.  Now to be fair I went back and looked and it doesn't actually say \"New\" in the description, but it doesn't say \"Used\" either.  The picture is of a new battery and describing it as \"Original\" leads people to believe they are receiving a new, original OEM replacement part.  This is not the case.  I called the customer service number and its an answering machine asking for your name, order number, and detailed description of why you are calling.  I somehow get the feeling they get a lot of calls complaining about this so they use this as a screening method.  This seller is shady and should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.  My recommendation...DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Bought these in Aug 07 and they worked great out of the box.  They were especially good in the gym or anywhere inside, but had a very limited range outdoors. When jogging you have to keep your device strapped to your arm-which is not a big deal and the headset works good.  Reason the review is in the past tense is that from one use to the next the volume up control stopped working. The volume down button worked, so I tried lowering the volume to the bottom and then increase..oh well..it reached the bottom and won't increase, so essentially you can't hear any sound out of it any longer.  I'll now have to deal with the warranty dept of Motorola I suppose. But I wouldn't buy these again, as I have read of this defect in other reviews"}

{"label": 7, "raw": "This device works great.  It syncs in a second with any bluetooth phone, computer, mp3 player, or other device.  The sound quality is incredible.  The controls allow you to adjust the volume, pause, fast forward or rewind, go to the next song or the previous one.  Incoming phone calls will beep and you can pause the music and answer the call just by touching a button.  there are two different types of earpieces that slide on so you can customize your fit.  The unit is water resistant and very tough.  I use it while biking or just around the house as it is very light and NO CORDS!  Works perfectly.  I highly recommend it.  Cons: none.  do yourself a favor and buy one, you won;t be disappointed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased these stereo bluetooth headphones for use with my Blackberry Curve 8900.These headphones work well indoors with no problems with connectivity, however the story is quite different when I am outside with the Blackberry in my pocket...the reception cuts in and out to the point where its unusable.  Holding the blackberry in my hand seems to improve the reception somewhat but that defeats the purpose.This is quite disappointing since I wanted to use these when I am out running so I am back to my wired headphones.  I am not sure if this is due to the Blackberry or the headphones itself.  There were some posts over in the Blackberry Forums that complain of this same problem."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Case is large, certainly, but as are all cases of this type.  It fits well, even with a third-party wireless charging card inside the battery compartment.  I wouldn't say it exactly looks good though.  If you've had an Otterbox, it looks like the rest, you're sacrificing appearance and size for protection.  I got it mainly because it comes with a belt clip, and the GS5 is a pretty big phone to carry in your pocket, especially as the days get warmer.It seems to attract and hold dust a lot.  Perhaps lighter colors wouldn't show that as much.  Personally, I find that big chunk of rubber protecting the headphone jack unnecessary.  The headphone jack on this phone is waterproof anyway, and there's a very big cutout in the bottom to access the charging port."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I moved from an S4 with this same series case to an S5 with the case. The S5 case feels like it has a lot more grip. It doesn't fit 100% perfectly, but it's really enough that it looks really crisp and more snug than the S4. The biggest issue I have with is that the headphone flap isn't easy to fully close, but it also isn't easy to open either, so it protects that jack well. It's difficult to take off, but that's also good in the sense that it won't snag and come off. Don't get this case if you're often opening up your phone to replace batteries or SD cards."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I got the case the same day I went to purchase the S5. Case is easy to take off and put on after the 1st time of disassembly. As has been mentioned before the hole for the home button is off by a slight bit. It isn't enough to detract from usage, but Otterbox should fix this and offer panel swapouts to those users who request them. As I work in retail, I know many of these are already in stores. Most people probably won't care, but it may contribute to poor fingerprint sensor operation. Other than this, I expect a long time of protection for my S5."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love the otterbox and feel that it does a great job protecting my phone.  It does add some weight to the phone but that is the trade off for being protected.  My one issue is that it took several tries to get the case to fit snuggly on the phone the top corner just did not want to take.  Also did not like the plastic top cover from otter box only because I had purchesed from Vorizon a top cover that kept it from getting smudges finger prints.  The cutouts are fine and no issues charging my phone with the otterbox cover being on."}

My phone looked so freakin awesome and the fit was perfect.In the end, I stole this one from my gf and started using it. The backside of it has a very nice feel, not slippery at all.I highly recommend this product, if you are a male, get the black one.Great looks, great feel, great protection, great fit, great price5 Stars"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "UPDATE:You will drop your phone using this case and I never dropped my phone before. It's very slick with no grip on the edges. Thankfully didn't damage the phone, which displays the HTC ONE's superior build quality as it was dropped on hard ceramic tile from 36\" counter height. Like I said before the clear plastic will and DOES scratch really easily.I did like that you could barely tell that my phone had a case on it and literally had compliments on that fact, but the risk of damage is too great for me.Just reinstalled the stock smoked(color can't display the awesome brushed aluminum on back)TPU case for now to protect it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:It does fit snug and snaps into place, but very limited edge coverage so won't protect like it should. Feels like it would snap/slip off the edge if dropped, not protecting the phone like it should. Polished hard plastic not the TPU rubber/plastic style so it will scratch easier on the back."}

Its super thin, you can hardly feel it on the phone, the volume buttons are easy to access, and I the top and bottom cut outs are one of my favorite features. The only part I don't love is that scratches are easily accumulated and I toss my phone in my purse so I've already acquired quite a few.. But that's the way it does with any hard case. I got one to keep as a backup and I'm ordering one of the soft TPU cases today :)"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've used this for a couple of years as a back-up charger for my Kindle or for some of the phones in my family.  I haven't had much luck charging my iPhone with it, but the rest of the phones did OK.  It's perfect for my Kindle though.As some other reviewers pointed out, it sticks straight out of the device that it's charging.  So it isn't very practical to use the device and charge it at the same time.  But if you're stuck in an airport and need to charge something before a flight, it sure beats not having any charge at all.I assume they designed it that way because it's a more efficient use of battery power than a longer cable would have been.  Just a guess...I don't leave home without mine though.  It's in my emergency cable pouch that I always take wherever I go.  I just have to remember to replace the batteries from time to time."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I picked this one based on the reviews.  It seemed like it had the best reviews for the price.  And yes, it works, and it works great.The back has a protection sheet to keep it clean for mounting on a dashboard.  But it's not glue-based, even on the back, so it comes right off.  Cleaning it to get it back to new would be difficult since it sticks to pretty much anything, but I don't see that being a problem long-term, as it even sticks on a veritcal surface perfectly.  Of course your phone won't stay on at 90degrees vertical, but from the testing I've done, it works great up to and over 45 degrees."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a very nice looking case and the Droid X fits nicely in it.  As another reviewer stated you have to modify it some so you can attach a charging cable to it.  That's not so bad. But the clip that installs on the case does not stay on securely and if you are getting out of your vehicle or up from a chair the seat belt or chair arm will pop the case right off the clip.  Luckily the case protects it well enough but I still don't like it coming off that easy."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It actually works well for the iPhone 5 also.  Durable and well made.  Comfortable to wear.  My last one broke after about 2 years....and I liked it so much that I reordered the exact same one.Update:  After a couple of months, the metal piece on the flap came out.  The magnets seem to be stronger than necessary and put a good tug on the simple method to keep that piece attached.  Still, it's inexpensive and I am re-ordering a new one because I like everything else about it,"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The range is really great and the battery life has been very good so far. It does the most important things well. Here's why I'm giving just 4 stars: 1) It picks up too much background noise. I was able to improve that someone with setting changes, but it still picks up significantly more than just the handset. 2) It suffers from interference with other bluetooth devices. If my cell phone and regular bluetooth are in proximity of me while I'm using this my voice will start cutting out. I have to move my cell phone and bluetooth to the side of my desk so it's not between me with this headset and the base. It's an easy fix, but caused a major issues for a while until I figured that out."}

Not sure if its the headphones or my LG Voyager, but sometimes even though the LG says the Sony headset is connected, music will come blaring out of the phone instead.

In fact, they are so clear, I can easily tell the difference between standard mp3 compression sound quality and audio CDs.  I've been using these headphones for days and hours at a time; and, it just doesnt run out of battery power.  It also does a great job of cutting out noise that you dont want to hear in the same room."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Although the plastic looks and feels like very cheap plastic and as if were to fall it'd come apart easily (mine has yet to fall), this is a nice idea of having a AC (home) and DC (on the road) charger for your Kindle or such.Keep in mind though you NEED a tip that's appropriate for your device.

The volume is loud and clear. The headset is very easy to wear for long periods of time because of it's light weight. It has GREAT talk and standby time and comes with a AC Adapter and a USB cable for charging, so you can have the AC Adapter at home and the USB cable at work or with your laptop for charging.I had a bit of trouble pairing it to my Treo 700Wx but got it working, it also paired fine with my wifes Motorola Razor and my kids Samsung U740.Great unit, good features and a good price!"}

That is inexcusable in my opinion. The manual on the web should be made up to date by a manufacturer at the very least).Once the headset was reset, not only was the sound quality better, I could finally use the long duration tap of the answer button feature to initiate voice calling on the cell phone through the headset.I actually like the headset now. No issues with voice or digit dialing.The only drawback I find is the earbud doesn't stay on the earpiece."}

I also was hesitant to buy because other reviews stated that it wasn't durable.  But I figured for the price I'll give it a try. I wouldn't lose much if it didn't work out for me and if it did then I got at an awesome price! I've had it for three months now and it works great.

I have our IPOD in an Otterbox case, and the flap opening catches on one edge of the connector. I simply used my Dremel tool to grind the corner off the catching edge of the connector, and it fits fine now,. If you have your IPOD uncased, it should work just fine. This connector that goes into the IPOD does have some release catches on it. You need to squeeze a tiny button on each side to release the connection. I mention this because none of my other IPOD cables have any kind of latching system."}

The stitching looks just fine and honestlyI don't see how it's going to come undone after a couple days. On a side note, there are two belt holster options. vertically and horizontally. The verticle holster is under the clip (which felt pretty durable) and then under that is the horizontal one.Maybe I'll end up being wrong, but I have heavy duty needles so I'll just use that to reinforce the stitching if need be. Or I'll be lazy and glue it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this case despite some negative reviews due to needing stuff ASAP as Sprint was shipping me my new S4 and i dread not having everything i need right away..I am using this case for a Samsung S4 with a Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 5200mAh Extended Battery + Black Back Cover (Compatible With ALL Samsung Galaxy S 4 Models) [18 Month Warranty] **NOW WITH NFC / Google Wallet** and the Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 Extended Battery HoneyComb Matte TPU Case / Cover  for the enlarged battery and Door. This case performed great for 2 weeks, then the GLUE just stopped holding the seams together for all stress points on the case. I bought mine from  DeCi Accessories. I cannot recommend this case."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Someone, somewhere has a dark sense of humor.  After ordering a CA-100 cable and waiting for the Brown Truck of Happiness to arrive, I discovered that inside the Amazon box was a sealed package festooned with Nokia logo and \"CA-100\" model designation.  The back of the package says \"Nokia Original Accessories\" too.  Inside the sealed box is a Nokia branded CA-101D cable.  What this means is that instead of the CA-100 cable that has a USB connector on one end, and a Nokia 2mm connector on the other, I ended up with a cable that has a micro-USB connector on one end.  So... No joy.  For a $6 cable I'm not going to burn gasoline and time returning it. I can always use this cable with my other devices. However, I cannot recommend this vendor at all."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This little product is awesome !!I use it with my unlocked Nokia 95-3 and Nokia 800 Internet Tablet to charge them from my Apple MacBook. It charges even when it is in sleep mode.It is tiny and extremely convenient.The price is high, but for the convenience and function it provides it is worth it. I was not able to find any cheaper similar products offered by third parties. This is the real thing from Nokia.I now no longer need to carry any bulky, ugly, power bricks with me to keep charged up. All I need is this little gem. Very nice Nokia !"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had 5 bluetooth headsets so far. Jabra was the first one I got, and now I'm back for Jabra. I had problem with it for a while; it kept dropping signals. I tried to update the firmware and now it's all good. I like the fact that customers can do their own maintenance.I'm very comfortable with the wearing, and I have no idea why some people complained--they might have special ear shape or size...I'm using it mostly as a stereo headset and the sound quality is quite acceptable. The only concern is its battery is not long as my other sets, it lasts about 5 hours when listen to music."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm really enjoying my new Kill A Watt monitor because for the first time I can see exactly where and how I'm utilizing power in my house and make a direct correlation back to my monthly bill. The monitor is very easy to setup as well as to move from outlet to outlet in the house. The only thing that's a little bit of a pain is that for some reason it's very difficult to unplug a plug from it. These really should be given out for free from all power companies because it's such an invaluable tool. Now I know exactly what I need to do in order to bring down my power bill. Love it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This one is not accurate. I have compared it against several high quality meters at work, and the 4460 is always off, but often by a different direction or a different amount.I miss the display in amps the older model had. It was very useful for determining circuit loads in cases where an amp clamp was not convenient.It also hogs both outlets of a standard duplex receptacle, so the other one is covered and unusable. (Yes, a pigtail would help)I e mailed the company twice about the inaccuracy and inconsistency, and did not receive a reply.It became more and more inaccurate and finally died."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Not bad, I had one of the knock off brands of this, Chicago Tools one from Harbor Freight and this was about the same in accuracy except it obviously has all the features of storing all the data on how much total electricity that devic you plugged in used and estimated cost based on the cost per KW you enter in.  Pretty nice device, yes it sucks that the outlets get taken up when you plug it in, but its not like you need it on there for ages, you just need to see for a short period of time how much power that particular device is using and then take it off.  Since purchasing this, I now have a whole house monitoring system (TED 5000) and love it.  I use this now to monitor any single device on demand when I need to."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We purchased this in an attempt to weed out which appliances are causing our electric bill to rise.  It takes a little practice and some time interpreting the instruction manual, but it is worth it to see exactly what each item is costing on an hourly, daily, weekly, etc. basis.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it can be very inconvenient to plug things into it.  The prongs on the back are positioned in such a way as to take up the entire outlet cover, so anything else plugged in has to be removed first.  This would be many times more user friendly if it had a short section of cord on the back so it could be plugged in and still positioned in such a way as to be more viewable too.  You have to get down eye level with wherever it is plugged in to read its results because as soon as you unplug it the display goes blank."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Yes - I use this about once ever two months...The latest case - I compared the Blendtec Blender which consumed 1546 watts on max while making a smoothie and then compared my old Ninja 1100 (rated for 1100 watts) but it only consumed 320 Watts on max!!! That is why it can't break down seeds and it SUX!!!I also detected that the ninja uses 2 watts while plugged in and off but the blendtec uses 0w.  Very handy device and it is a must for all that care about saving energy and giving our world a future."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This plugs directly into the outlet, and the appliance plugs into the Kil-A-Watt, so unless your plug is really high, you're infor a bad time because the display turns off immediately when unplugged. The interface isn't what I'd call exceptionally intuitive. It does what it's supposed to, and gave me the confidence to tell the power company they lied on my bill. They actually estimated my electricity consumption instead of reading it like they said they did. My bill leveling was readjusted & I didn't pay the 3x price they tried making me pay. Three months later & still am right!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The over-the-ear piece is a not a good fit for my ears. Moreover, they are extremely fragile and prone to breaking. Within 5 minutes of getting the phone out of the box, I broke the ear piece just trying to get the headset over my ear. I put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece. The plastic piece covering the control buttons seemed very cheap also, and I think it would be a matter of time before that broke as well. I generally take good care of my headsets and electronic equipment, so if the headset seemed fragile to me, it probably will for most. Also, as a woman with a small head, the headset just felt clumsy and big. On the upside, the acoustics seemed decent, but then I only used the headset once and decided to return it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've owned bluetooth devices by Scala, Motorola, and Plantronics.  The Jawbone is the first unit I've used in which no one has asked, \"Are using a bluetooth?\"  I think that, in and of itself speaks volumes.  The only drawback I've encountered is loss of pairity (if that's a word!).  It seems like about every couple of days it becomes unpaired.  Trying to reconnect doesn't work.  I have to remove the device from the phone and start all over again.  I'm not sure why this happens so frequently but I still believe the Jawbone is a superior bluetooth device."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have found the Aliph Jawbone noise shield headset to be a pretty good unit.  It fits me pretty well, doesn't fall out, has good audio for hearing, and I have consistently gotten good audio reports from the people I talk to.A few nits.  The charger hookup unit is just plain wierd, and is counterintuitive to hook up.  Why do engineers feel compelled to make thousands of different charging standards for similar devices?  Also, while talking, you have to be careful if you adjust the unit on your ear--it is easy to accidentally hang up on someone.Overall, this is the first hands-free device that I have actually been able to tolerate and use.  I am satisfied, although the unit is a bit pricey."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the best BT of the iPhone that I have found.  I have tried 6 different BT devices tis year and this is the best one s far.I wear the BT 8 to 10 hours a day without any discomfort.I have hearing loss from being routinely exposed to loud noise levels while in the US Army (The M-16 m4 makes a loud bang when fired), but I have no problem hearing with this device, even when diving with the windows down.The BT device comes with different pieces that attach around your ear (2 for the right ear and two for the left ear) and several different ear cushions that sit in your ear.  It fits so well, I forget that the jawbone is in my ear.The call quality is excellent according to my spouse.The reason for only four stars is the buttons, while only two, are hard to press.  Other than that small problem, this is a great BT headdest."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "One thing about chargers these days is the build quality.  I've owned and thrown out so many that I've come to the realization that the cheap plastic $5.00 ones are the ones that break the quickest.  So I decided to spend a little more this time.  The Scosche is defintely built well, feels great too.  I've plugged in all my devices and all charge well.  I would buy again.Oh, i've purchased wiring harnesses from Scosche.  They sell good quality stuff."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I went to best buy to replace the one that broke and they wanted I think like $20 or more for just a single USB version...I decided to check amazon on my phone first and found this dual one way cheaper here. My old one lasted a few years and I'm sure this one will too. I think my old one died because i had it loose in a bag and i think one of the parts may have been hit by something too. It works great though if you're looking for one!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I must have read more than 30% of the reviews on Amazon about the product. Nonetheless I decided to ignore the iphone 4 users that complained about not working and thus relaying on the product description. Alas, that was an awful choice. After connecting it and displaying the charging symbol about 2 minutes later it warned me the device does not support charging. I tried 3 more times and every time it kept dropping so I decided to leave it as such, even worse the battery seemed to have turned hot. It does charge other usb devices but it failed to deliver the purpose of its purchase: charge my iPhone 4."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this charger for over three years and it still works like a charm. Love that I can plug dual items into it while I am driving and it's great for long road trips when you need to plug in multiple things at one time. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking to charge ANYTHING that takes a USB port. Description says iphone 5, 5S, and 5C, but I've plugged in all sorts of things that have a USB charger and it works great.Worth the money!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is not one of those compact designer USB car charger things - but I like it and it does a good job. It feels nice - not like cheep plastic.It takes my iPhone 4S and my Jawbone Bluetooth device at the same time and charges them just as you would expect.The reviews on some of the compact designs did not fill me with confidence. I would prefer it to be smaller - but I would rather it was reliable.If the reliability changes I will update the review. So far so good."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had the Scosche USB Charger for 6 months and I absolutely love it! It has worked for all the devices I plug into it thus far and it has been very reliable. I use it to charge my Garmin GPS, phone, Kindle, Pocket PC, and a other electronic gadgets.The build quality of the charger is excellent. It has a nice, slightly rubbery feel to it. It is beautifully designed and will make an attractive addition to your car. The green LED light indicates it's powered up, and unlike a lot of devices with LED's, it isn't distractingly bright.If you need a Dual USB Car Charger, the Scosche is a good bet."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Product looks solidly built. The plastic feels velvety smooth. The N85 doesn't charge on this but that's a Nokia issue, not USB device issue. The ipod touch 2nd Gen charges, tho. So it works.I thought it was going to be too high for my VW jetta since it sticks straight up but there's enough space there to stick whatever you want to charge.Product works! Mygearstore shipped it quickly. Not as fast as the Prime 2 day but it was fast enough.UPDATED Jan2012: After 2 years, the product just stopped working. Green light would flicker in/out. Threw it out."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "We own several Palm Pre's and wanted to use this dual charger to power them up in our car. Unfortunately this device can't provide sufficient power to charge 2 at once. It can charge one Palm Pre at a time, but can't charge up 2 at a time.If you have cell phones, or devices that need 800-1,000ma each, this charger can't do it. Total power out seems to be about 800ma split between the two USB ports.Other than being weak in the power department, the unit appears to be well constructed, it does fit 2 USB cords comfortably, and has a charge indicator light so you know when its in use."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "this is a great product for multiple devices in a vehicle that only has one port, i recommend it to anyone looking for extra ports in an older vehicle...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a cheap way of charging any device that will charge via a regular USB port. I have used it in my car for several months without a problem.  It did a fine job with my AT&T; Tilt phone and my iPod.Before you invest in this or any other standalone USB charger, you should make sure that your device will charge via USB cable alone.  Many phones (Motorola Razr is one) these days have what looks like a standard USB connection but require special software or adapters before they will charge.I got this for about $5 or $10 at Wal-Mart.  Great investment."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Beware that there are two different products shown in the Amazon product pictures as of 8/19/2013. I purchased and review only the round one with corner and bottom openings. From my experience, China-origin venders of this kind of products often ship very different items from what are shown in Amazon product pages.Prior to this, I had tried 3 similar holsters which died in a few weeks to months. But his product has been lasting very long with trusted reliability.Now after 3-1/2 years, though my iPhone has been upgraded from 3GS to 4S, I am still happy with the holster and I went abroad with them several times with confidence. But aging is an inevitable process and the holster now looks very worn. I plan to buy an exact replacement if I can find a trustful vender."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a very well constructed leather carrying case for the iPhone.  You can attach this to your belt and have the headset plugged in at the same time.  The case is tight, well designed and protects the iPhone while in the case.  The case is very tight at first, because it is leather, but will stretch slightly.  You cannot fit anything other than an iPhone (meaning no extra protective sleeve) in the case.Only complaint I have is that the iPhone has to be placed in a specific direction in order for the headphone jack to be useable.  I wish it was constructed so that the jack could be used no matter which way the iPhone was placed."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I love the DLO case, it fits my iphone perfectly and is very convienent to use, but as I read in other reviews (which I ignored), the Belt Clip does indeed go bad after about 6 months.  It tears away from the leather backing and then the phone can just drop off your waist. Because of the really good padding on this case you may not even know that it dropped and some lucky person walking behind you will get a free Iphone.I am on my Second DLO case so this is not some unlucky fluke, there is a defect in the way the Belt clip is bonded to the leather case and believe me when it starts to rip away its only a matter of days before the phone and leather case fall away from the clip."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Charges my phone quickly enough.  There's a convenient little clip that's hard to see in the photos, but which keeps the coiled portion together so the cable isn't flopping around all over.  It also gives a bit of peace of mind to know it's a Motorola branded charger that's less likely to overcharge/fry my phone.  One small, minor issue is that the light plug end occasionally pops out of its own volition after a warm/cold weather swing, but the blue light is bright enough so you notice when it goes out."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "After reading all of the reviews, most of the other cases seemed a lot sketchier to me (reviews were very mixed).  I figured it was worth the extra few dollars to get a great one that I knew would work well (this was getting great reviews).  I didn't want to have to deal with trying to return a cheap $3 charger to some random company and risk that it would put my Droid on the fritz.  The extra few bucks was great for peace of mind.  It works perfectly and charges pretty fast.  No issues and love it!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this adapter because my HTC Rezound is a power hog, and my other cigarette adapter chargers couldn't charge my phone fast enough.  This charger pumps out the power, more than enough to keep my phone fully charged no matter how many things I'm doing at the time.  I can have it docked and displaying GPS information with the screen at full intensity while on a phonecall using my bluetooth headset, and this charger does the job.pros:  Powers the most amp-hungry devices without a hiccup.  Solid construction, thick cable.cons:  The adapter end is quite large.  The end glows bright neon blue when plugged in, which can be rather distracting at night in a darkened vehicle."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I originally purchased one of these a couple of years back when I got a new cell phone and needed a car adapter that was brand specific and a little bit more attractive than the ones in line at the grocery store ;) I was amazed at how much better it was than all of my other micro-usb adapters/chargers. It definitely charges more quickly than most generic chargers ever will, the light, while obvious, is not distracting like some have suggested, and the thing lasts 10 times longer than any other charger I've used. I purchased this one for a friend who needed a car charger...and I've purchased more than 8 so far and currently have been running the same two in my personal car with ZERO issue for over 4 years.It's cheaper than ANY charger you'd buy at your wireless store and only barely more expensive than the cheap generic chargers you can find (that often are loose in the socket or the phone) and I'm glad I made the switch"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've had this charger for over a year, it gets very light use and it stopped working. What happens is the microUSB connector doesn't make good contact and we have to wiggle and finagle the cable to get it to work and even then it only works for a few seconds, until you hit a bump and the cable vibrates and loses its connection. I've had the same issue with mini usb to micro usb adapters from Motorola - bought half a dozen of them and none of them work reliably. I won't buy a motorolla micro usb connector again. The media bridge cables are the best, they feel like they click in when you connect them, very solid. Motorola? Not so much."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I purchased the Motorola P513 Vehicle Power Adpater to replace the original Verizon car micro/USB charger that I purchased with my Motorola Droid and Palm Pre.  I have no use for the regular USB slot that is on the top of adapter and pretty much thought the thing was bulky and an eye sore.  This power micro adapter is slimmer, lightweight and the cord is just the perfect length.  The soft blue glowing \"M\" is pretty neat too.Call me silly, but I was worried that the center blue light would be made out of glass and was concerned if the sun hit it, it might start a fire.  I was happy to find out that it is made of a lightweight beveled plastic instead.Besides using it to charge my cell phones, I can also use it to charge my GPS system and bluetooth headset also requires a micro USB.Great buy under $10 dollars - highly recommended!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have a Samsung Galaxy S3, and I have a total of 4 chargers (including the wall charger that came with the Galaxy S3). This is by far the best car charger I have ever owned. Two reasons: (1) It charges seemingly as fast a the factory wall charger from Samsung; and (2) it is very well built. It is light, but you can tell by the feel its quality. The performance is excellent. Additionally, the cord is long enough to actually use the phone while it charges in the car.The fact that I spent less than $7 for this seems incredible. This charger works better than the Samsung (OEM) car charger that I own and paid over $20 for."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This seems to be a great charger - when it works. It seems to work fine with my wife's Tracfone - a Motorola EX124G but would not charge my Tracfone - an LG 500G... so I'm reducing the rating by one star. I suspect the blame may lie more on the LG phone side, but I am still disappointed that I need another charger to charge my LG phone.By the way, I highly recommended buying from a reputable retailer to make sure you get the real thing. I bought mine from Amazon."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a great charger for almost any phone.  I purchased it for my wife's Samsung S3, but permanently borrowed it for my car after my failed purchase with the Samsung Official OEM Car Charger for your Galaxy S2 Phone.  See my review on the Samsung OEM charger for more details.The charger quickly powers your phone and looks good while doing it.  Motorola gave it a sleek design that lights up blue when the charger is ready.  The cord is long enough for mid size or smaller vehicles to keep it plugged in while using the Navigation app on your phone.  If you have a Samsung Galaxy S2 or S3 and need a back up or replacement car charger, I highly recommend this purchase."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have no idea if this is a real Motorola product or a great copy.  Either way, it is incredibly well made and works.  I refused to pay the rip off prices at my local cellphone shop, and the pices at Walmart and Target weren't much better.For less than $5 I got a well made item that works very well.  I'm not sure yet how rapid of a charger it really is, but it works.  That's all I care about.I highly recommend this item."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Not much to say other than since this is a genuine name-brand high quality charger, you aren't apt to fry your device or slowly destroy the innards with a low-grade poorly regulated charger.  This one charges about as quickly as I've seen a car charger do its job, has a very nice decently long cord, seems well constructed, and doesn't leave me worrying about how much shorter the life expectancy of my phone is going to be if it doesn't get fried in the meantime.  I do expect that this is going to outlast the junk I've purchased in the past for $2-3.  Surprisingly, this isn't that much more expensive than those, so there is no reason to skimp on that $1-2."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I used the charger on one long trip and I can finally give it a review. Lets get right to it. On the trip I had 4g on, GPS on, Power Amp music player open and Carhome app opened. In the first half of the trip I noticed that the phone wasn't charging but it wasn't losing any juice either. It was just enough power to maintain how much battery was in there when I started the trip. With the carhome app the screen doesn't turn off unless you do it yourself. So I turned the screen off and when I got to my destination the battery went from 60 to 85% full in about an hour or so. The first half of the trip I wasn't happy at all with it because I thought it wasn't powerful enough to charge my phone. But after keeping the screen off and only turning it on to switch the song it really helped."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I haven't used a vehicle charger for cell phones in years.  Two reasons mainly.  I rarely drive, I'm usually riding the motorcycle wherever I go.  And two, the batteries last so long that I never saw the need to spend $25 + for the few times I do drive.  Just have a full charge, and I was good to go.But, with the droidx, once you start using the smart phone features, like the GPS (which I use when I leave my regular GPS at home), the battery goes down faster than just used as a phone.And, with the price ($4.71, though it's now $3.15), I figured why not?  I don't use it much, because, like I said, I don't drive that often.  But when I do, the charger is with me.An excellent deal, and I'm very pleased with it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My original review was \"best mobile charger I've owned\".  I even bought one for my girlfriend after she saw mine.  Now, in less than 3 months, both are failing.  It starts with a poor connection at the phone where you have to wiggle it or place it in a certain position to charge and devolves into not being able to charge at all.  Mine is a complete loss and hers is on the way out.  If I just had one and it failed I wouldn't give such a poor rating, but both failing together lets you know there is an inherent flaw in the design.  I've very disappointed because it was an excellent charger during the brief time it worked."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I absolutely loved this product so much that I am now buying them as gifts for everyone I know.  For anyone who is a heavy user of juice, this thing rocks!  It works better than all of the others I have used.  It is a must for business travelers!! For the price, buy three!Update 10/12I ended up pinching the USB input so I had to buy a new one.  I bought two more.  The sign of a good product is whether you would buy it again.  In this case, absolutely!!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "With a new Mtorola Razr Maxx in my Verizon shopping cart, I was put off by the high prices for chargers and charger \"bundles\" so over to Amazon I came.Found this one here and have had no problems at all with it. The 12v plug fits snugly, the mini-usb fits the phone just right and that cool blue circle just looks great when running in the car.What can I say, the packaging looks pretty authentic for an OEM part, but my field is not in copyright infringement, so what do I know? :-)I really didn't expect to be impressed by the way a car charger looks, but it's really a nice piece of design work and the round piece at the end gives you something to grasp when removing it from the socket. And what a price! I would advise you to go for it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "My husband & I were sharing one car charger between two cars.  This plan was not working out so well.I bought this because I have a Motorola phone and wanted to make sure it would be compatible. In reality...I just wanted the glowing blue circle.The charger does work quickly!  I've had no problems charging my Atrix HD. It is a micro USB charger so it also fits my husband's Samsung Galaxy3, my son's Nokia Lumia, and I've used it to charge the Kindle Fire.Works fast. Looks good.  Excellent buy.  I've had it since early August and there have been no issues.  I do keep it in my vehicle and it doesn't get moved around or handled very much. I'm not sure if that makes a difference but wanted to note it now in case there are problems in the future.  It is used at least 5 days per week."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The only reason I rated it with 4 and not 5 stars is because I ordered one and had to get it replaced because it wasn't working within a couple weeks. However, the most recent one, I've had for months and it's still going strong.  Charges much faster than the other chargers I've ordered over the years.  That circle shines a bright blue light, which is kind of neat, but a little distracting in the car at night.  But over all, quite good."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Motorola P513 Car ChargerThe P513 is a micro-USB car charger that works on the Droid, Droid2, and DroidX. I can't figure out a way to change the inline fuse (if there is one), but it is cheap enough to be used as a disposable car charger. The blue LED-lit Motorola logo is a nice touch, as well as the wire tether that is included.Pros: Gets the job done at a great price, looks greatCons: Doesn't appear to be an easy way to change the fuse (if any) - but it is not a big dealOverall: 5/5 stars"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I would be quite content with summary like that...This thing has a few months of track record by now. I am happy, in the dark it makes finding the cord really easy because of that big blue illuminated eye... I have had so many crappy chargers I bought 2 different ones at the same time in case it dies prematurely, have not even tried the other one yet. It also fits snugly in the phone socket, and the backside of the plug is labelled with a shiny sticker, so you are not trying to force it the wrong way, eventually killing one or both of them... Little thing like that... need to appreciate the thought - because every day it makes your life easier..."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Even when trying to be careful with the battery on my HTC Rezound (custom ROM, custom kernel, CPU governors), it can drain faster than I'd like when I'm using 4g and on the phone often.  I had a generic microUSB charger from Verizon, but it would only charge as \"USB\" and not provide enough power to overcome the amount of battery power being used (like phone, navigation, and data at the same time).This was cheap enough to take a risk on and I'm glad I did!  It is recognized as an \"AC\" charger and charges the phone even while multi-tasking.I like the coiled cord as well (I'm also using a 90 degree adapter to make it easier to plug into the phone)."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this charger not for a Motorola but for a Dell Venue Pro (just another micro usb device) and it works perfectly, charges when in use, etc...The charger lights up blue when plugged in which I kinda like, if that sort of thing bugs you then don't get this charger, although the price is great and it does what it claims to. Definitely recommend.In addition to the Dell Venue Pro I can confirm that this charges the Lumia 900, Lumia 520, Lumia 928, and my current Lumia 1020. I'm still using this charger several years later. It works very well!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This car charger is authentic. I checked/inspected it and did not find anything wrong with it. For less than $10, this is a steal. It works with my Motorola Atrix.The charger has a blue, dim blue light that will remain on, as long as it is being used. The cord is pretty standard, nothing to add about is durability, if you've seen others, this is not different. Except, this charger is very fast.This should work with any cell phone that has a Micro-USB connection."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have heard many fake copies of this charger.  To be safe, just order it off Amazon's own online store unless you know the other providers are reputable.The quality of this car charger is quite nice.  The twisted cable is a nice feature since it can be extended and will not dangle wildly in your car when it is in motion.  I also had another micro usb charger and it used to take forever for it to charger your phone.  The only thing I liked about my previous car charger is that you were able to connect a usb cable into the usb ports it provided but the time it took to charge your phone was not adequate for me."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I don't understand the bad reviews it's 6$ can't really complain if it last a few months or years. I own 4 now to be in multiple cars and so I can charge more then once device at a time. I am very happy with the price and product. Don't know why this product is so good and beats what you would pay 5 times more for at the store. Just shows how much we as a cosumer get ripped off. Alwasy buyer beware esspecially online. So I at least make sure it is shipped from and sold from Amazon Only so IF there is a problem it's easy to return or exchange."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is no ordinary charger, it supplies LOTS of power. Most chargers really do cheap out on the amperage.  This feeds my power-hungry HTC Thunderbolt beautifully.I tried doing all of the power-hungry stuff you can do, simultaneously: GPS, 4G, and access point on and maxed out by a connected computer. Even after all of this, it still managed to charge after a long time. The phone got plenty hot.The first one I got only worked for a day.  Got a completely free one shipping paid for both ways."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This charger is decent. It works, which is what's important. But some of the features are fairly annoying, which most people can accept, given the low price of the unit, and the convenience of a coiled wire.First off, the unit is large. the plug head is massive, and unsightly. It's basically sticking an advertisement for Motorola into your car, who wants that?Second, the price you pay, you can easily afford a dual-usb socket, which while meaning you'd have to provide your own USB cables, means you can charge two items at once, and it's not in your way as those sockets are relatively tiny.Third, the item emits a blue light, that illuminates the center plastic piece. This is unnecessary to me, and is actually an eyesore, as the blue can be distracting while you drive at night."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Item is \"as described\" as of 12/2010. No where does it say it is bulk packaging or retail packaging. Item arrived in 3 days in bulk packaging exactly like j. raftery's picture. Having owned this exact item 3 years ago, I am led to believe this is a genuine motorola item. Markings, feel, quality of coil cord, and genuine motorola accessory hologram sticker on tip of plug seem to be like my old one. Great price (around $5) and it works (HTC Incredible). I would recommend this item."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Okay so it works like any other charger, it still take the same amount of time to charge it has a cool look I was expecting more but hey how much more can you get out of a car charger. It took a some time to get to me plus it was not good on updating me on the tracking. So those are my negatives here are my positives..... I did get the product within the time adviced, it will charge up my phone and it has a cool blue look. Thats all I can give ya. Will still continue business with this company but will make sure to investigate comments before buying."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "PROS:--Plugs into your phone (my Galaxy Note 2) very securely. The metal tip of the plug is longer and thinner than most plugs, allowing the plug to reach all the way into charging port, even if you have a protective cover on your phone.--Plug does not fall out of phone, even when phone is sitting in a vertical docking station, and the roads are bumpy. This is great.  It snaps in with confidence.--Long cord so you can talk while charging.--Has cord hook so you can make it half as long when not using.--Big, visable blue light to ensure it's plugged in to lighter. Light is pleasantly subtle.--Truly from Motorola.  Not some fake \"Motorola\"CONS:It doesn't taste all that good."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is a great fast charger by Motorola. It's increasingly trickier to determine if something sold on Amazon or elsewhere is genuine product or not. \"OEM\" isn't sufficient anymore and most of the non brand name stuff is junk. Be sure to buy \"by Motorola\" (or whatever your brand is - but Motorola will work for most) and these are now half a ten spot on Amazon and lots more in the store.My one complaint, and reason for dinging a star, is that the cord is way too short for use in most vehicles. It's fine for a non smart phone sitting in the console or a cup holder - but it's far too short for smart phone use with the phone positioned on or near the dashboard. I've been unable to find a micro-micro usb extension so I may switch to an power adapter with a socket and just use a long regular usb cable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have a Galaxy Nexus, and my wife has a Samsung Droid Charge phone and we use this as our charger of choice in both of our cars.  I've bought several different type of generic knock off chargers in the past.  Some that did work, but broke easily, and some that were so poorly made that they wouldn't charge my phone at all.  This Motorola made charger does a great job of charging my phone.  Even if I am streaming music via Bluetooth to my car and using my phone as a GPS, the charger is still able to overcome the power drain and keep the battery charging.  If I had to make one nitpick its the bright blue logo that is lit up while its plugged in.  Its not overpoweringly bright, but its unnecessary in my opinion.  Despite this, I still think this is the best value for a cell phone charger out there.  Highly recommended!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I'm amazed on how fast this would charge my phone. I thought it was a gimmick on the rapid charge but its not. I can leave my girl's house at 15% battery by the time I'm home it has 80% charge. We live about 35 miles apart. ***Update when I bought this I was using it for my old Motorola Photon 4G phone now I own a Samsung Galaxy S3 it's rapid charge not effective as it was with the Photon but it still does the job. I still like the feature of the blue light that glows once you plug it in to the 9V lighter port. Would be nice to have an indicator to show full charge/charging mode. Hopefully it'll be a nice addition to newer chargers."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am using this vehicle charger in a work provided Astro van. I purchased this after my upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy SII. I originally bought cheap cig lighter to USB adapters, but one of them popped a fuse on the Astro. I threw it away and bought this higher quality device. When it is receiving power from the car the round end where the cable attaches to glows a soft blue color. The cord has a built in simple management system. the two ends of coiled area snap together. It bundles the cord a little and helps to keep it out of the way, not by a lot, but a little, and every little bit helps in a car. The power output is lower than wall charger provided by Samsung, but adequate. After the cheap adapter blew a fuse, I decided not to put something in the work van that could damage the van further and I believe this is a quality product."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is only a 1 amp charger, and does work very well.  And you know, it looks cool with the light up Motorola logo.....really cool.But be forewarned, it will NOT fast charge a Galaxy Note 2......it will charge faster than a standard USB charge........but not as fast as a 2 amp charger.  And if you are using your Note 2 as a GPS, it will barely maintain the current charge.  If used normally, it will charge, but just not real fast."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I bought this originally for my Sprint Evo 3D.  It does exactly what it should, and feels like a quality product.  I originally bought an el cheapo cigarette lighter charger online, and it fell apart after 5 months of light use.  This one feels much more sturdy than any I have ever owned.  Also, at night, gives a cool blue effect from the lighted up part.  It's not really bright, so it won't affect your driving/blind you at night.  The cable is very long, so you don't have to worry about it being too short.  Great product.  I recently purchased the Sprint Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly with it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I originally bought this for a Motorola phone, and when I upgraded to a Samsung, I decided to continue using it since the connector was the same. It worked perfectly. I've upgraded again, and it continues to work. It is a rapid charger, and I find that it does charge my phone more quickly than a regular charger. It has a sleek style, and I like the \"blue light\" that glows when the charger is powered. I've bought these for my wife and two sons (and none of us have a Motorola phone). But what I love most, is the PRICE (under $6 as of this review)!!! Verizon would charge me quadruple for a charger.[...]"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This charger is one of the fastest I have for my phone. Being a Micro B USB it will work with almost any smart phone. The spiral wound cord works well for the short distance in my car, but still is long enough for the chasm of my old Ford Truck as well. The only drawback that I've come across is that bright blue LED that can light up the whole car at night. It's very distracting while driving and I strongly suggest rotating the charger so the light is away from the driver's eyes."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I've almost lost count as to how many of these I've purchased already -- I normally keep two in each car to not only charge, my HTC Sensation, but my work Blackberry as well. I've purchased more to make sure I can plug them into rental cars (as I'm prone to forget things here and there) and keep my devices charged.It's a simple adapter, with a glowing blue end - and does everything it has to!Make sure it's purchased from Amazon - too many other reviewers also complain about getting a knock-off product!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "The best!! No other description needed. I have ordered seven of these. Five for myself and a couple for a friend. The only problem I've had is keeping them for myself. Borrowed one to a coworker and rather than return it, he gave me a $10 bill instead. Another was stolen from my company vehicle. I keep one in every vehicle and one in my lunch box. Never had one fail or have had to wiggle the micro USB end to get it to work like all the el-cheapo ones I had before. For the price Amazon sells them, you can order five of them and select Free Super Saver Shipping and it'll still be cheaper than going to a big box store or one of the carriers retail outlets where it'll cost you $30 for the same unit or anything comparable."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I have used so many car chargers for micro usb devices.  Many cheap made in china, chargers takes forever to charge the phone.  Some even do not fit well in socket, and some I had to position the charger to charge the phone.  In some charger cord came off from base charger and or micro usb end.After I invested money in this, it seems like solution of all problems.1. Durable cord, which I believe that will be fine during cold winter.2. Durable connections to base charger and micro usb end.3. Cool blue lamp which indicates charger is well connected in power socket.4. No problem with connecting and charging any micro usb phone.I liked it so much that I ordered second one to replace it in my second car!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I don't know much about amps, etc.  This item seems to work well on my Motorola Razr Maxx (because of the battery in the Maxx I am not that dependent on a car charger anymore. Yaay!!!)  But I wish the cord was longer.  I find that the pull of the cord (because it is short) makes it harder to talk while the phone is connected to the cord.  It is also too short when trying to use the vehicle phone dock.  I would rather deal with a bit of extra cord (say a 6ft. length) than have to tussle with a short cord."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This USB charger really does work quicker than the one it replaced.  I'd bought a generic charger from Amazon some time ago and at some point it got crushed and broke apart.  The Motorola is just a bit bigger than most chargers, but the glowy blue circle is easy to grip and doesn't get in the way of my gearshift, which is actually a pretty important thing to know when you drive a stick.I've noticed it charges my Samsung Galaxy SIII fairly quickly--with it below 20% I might but close to the top in an hour or so.  The cord is long and the coiled nature even provides more stretch if you need it."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "It works really well. Callers say I sound clear, although they know they are on speaker, even when the car is quiet.  I'm very happy with it.I like that if I forget to turn it on, I can turn it on when my phone rings and it will answer the call after it powers up.I have a retractable usb cable connected to it all the time.  I have just under zero slack on the cable.  It's tucked behind the rear view mirror.  The cord is thin and barely noticeable.  Plus I can retract the cable away if I want a more elegant look with passengers in the car.I tried the music stream feature when I first got the unit and never tried it again. :-)  The sound isn't great so don't buy it for the music feature."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "Just got this on 6/5/2011 - Great automotive Bluetooth FM transmitter for Music and Speaker Phone for my iPhone 3G. Charged it fully right out of the box and then started using it. My unit came with the car cigarette lighter charger and literature.  I used a standard mini-USB power charger that I had and that worked fine.  Car charger also works well. Sound quality is great for both phone calls and for music through the car stereo. Tonal quality is fine on the stock stereos in my cars. For a more critical listening test, I set the FM transmitter for my Home Theater Surround System and the music sounds great on that also (good imaging and tonal quality). The unit appears to be durably constructed and should last."}
{"label": 7, "raw": "This is the first BT ear piece I have had that actually works the way it should.  Very light, fits in the ear well and after a couple of days I almost forgot I have it on.  Some people complain about the unusually long button hold to end a call, but I have not had a problem with it.  Battery life is excellent.  Not as good in the wind as I had hoped but this is true of most BT ear pieces I have tried.  In the car works like a champ.Be sure you check the firmware version and upgrade to the latest.  The one I received was 2 releases behind.  This feature alone is worth the price!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I found this headset very comfortable, with excellent audio quality, the few times it successfully connected to my Nokia phones.After working with BlueAnt tech support and trying it on two different phones, they admitted that they have a known issue with Symbian OS phones (most Nokia and some other smartphones) where the headset can be \"paired\" with the phone, but it does not connect reliably for incoming or outgoing calls. Phrases used by the tech included:\"[We] haven't got around the compatibility issues with Symbian phones.\"\"[this is a] known issue.\"and apparently there is a significant amount of discussion on the BlueAnt support boards (which he could not find during our call).NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SYMBIAN OWNERS as much as I would like to!"}
{"label": 7, "raw": "I am a tech-saavy first-time owner of a Bluetooth headset.So far, the Z9 has been great.Pros:*Works with my cellphone's voice recognition so I press one button and say \"Call SoAndSo\".  I *LOVE* this feature.*Easy re-pairing after On/Off cycle*Decent battery life (I use my cell phone ~6 times daily, and it lasts 2 days)*Fits VERY SECURELY in my ear.Cons:*I've noticed a few times when the sound/mic stopped mid-call after about 30 mins.  Maybe I need a firmware update.*Other party can't hear me well with wind or background noise, even with the Enhance voice feature. But I can't imagine that many other devices perform much better*Learning curve. There are 3 buttons and with them, I can perform 20 functions.  There is 1 led light which represents 6 status indications.  It'll take some time before I know all of them, but the basic ones are very easy to learn."}

Other than that my little girl LOVES her tutus (we got one in light pink also), especially spinning and running in them :)  She's on the little side, so my concern was that it would be too big, but the fit is perfect!

{"label": 8, "raw": "I wanted to have the title summarize my thoughts if you decide not to read the entire review.  My granddaughter likes the Shining Image Jewelry Box given to her for a birthday gift from Grandma.  I wish the drawers were deeper for holding her many necklaces.  Also, I wish the drawers had a stop, preventing the drawers from tipping contents entirely when trying to remove one piece of jewelry.  My granddaughter is only five years old, so having the background knowledge of knowing when to stop the action of pulling the drawer from the base requires practice.  I, on the other hand, have had lacks of years of practice with jewelry drawers, but also struggle with removing the drawer without spilling the contents."}

I have recently returned to college to finish out my Bachelors. The university I'm enrolled in requires two years of a foreign language. Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now. BUT with using Rosetta, I was not only able to get through my class without sounding and feeling like an idiot, but I actually got A's!! I never thought that was a possibility. I'm not ready to jet off to France or anything but I'm not a complete moron any more either. I'm calling that a huge success.

{"label": 8, "raw": "Bring French to life!If your child is taking their first year of French or you are ready to head off on vacation and want to learn the language yourself, Rosetta Stone is a great learning tool for you both!  Version 4 comes with the learning lessons, headset with mic, app to use with your iPhone or iPod Touch for on the go learning and access to a virtual community online for lessions, games and chat!  I really don't think you can ask for more from a product.My only regret is that I didn't know about this product sooner! I certainly would have bought it for each one of my children throughout their schooling! What a GREAT product for homeschooling as well!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was thrilled to get the Rosetta Stone and be able to begin a lifelong desire to speak Italian!The software was very easy to load and use. The simple approach to learning a language as a child does was one terrific idea!I agree with other posters that to become fluent you will need to purchase more than just this level 1 program. However, this does allow you to learn some simple things and I do feel you could communicate enough to get your idea across.And, it is FUN to do! I'm enjoying it immensely!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Exactly what i wanted as a gift for a friends 1st trip to europe.This is made from the soft kind of fabric that is comfortable to sleep with against your skin.Just the right amount of space to fit a passport and 2 additional sections of the same main pocket,for currency, credit cards, tickets, etc.It's important to get one like this that has no metal, so it can be worn through security check points,with metal detectors without the need to remove it.This is crucial as no one but you should know this is where the bulk of your important items are.The one main pocket is closed with a velcro strip.It also has a nice thickness to the cord and well chosen adjustment buckle for it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "the last time i travelled i got one of the waist ones, and it was so annoying i never used it.  i haven't yet really used this one but i already feel much better about it.  i tried it out when i first opened the box when it came and wore it for a bit around my neck.  i don't like the toggle, but i doubled up the strap and tucked the toggle in the top flap of the stash and it works great.  i also wrapped it around my calf just below my knee to see if that would work too.  it worked just fine and i might wear it there when i wear my boots. i'm not sure if it really needs all those different departments, but that's ok. i don't think it's too big or too small."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Soft and really light.  Works really well and is very well thought out with 2 zippered pockets and an large Velcro pouch with 2 separate pockets.  I find this a very good arrangement.  Money in one zippered pocket and card and license in the other and the cell phone in the Velcro pocket. I also like the adjustment on the length of cord so you can wear it high or lower.  Not my everyday wallet as a full size Spec Op but this is great for days when more security is need or no pockets."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this item to attach the handle of a backpack to a 22&#34; carryon.  The strap is well constructed, but the minimum length is too long to avoid your backpack from dragging the ground when pulling the carryon. A laptop bag or purse is fine, but not anything as vertically high as a backpack.  I purchased the Travelon bungee cord for this purpose and will try it on my next trip.  I'd shorten the minimum length of this thing and it would be fine.  Otherwise, it will be fine with a checked bag coupled with a smaller carryon or purse/backpack. But for smaller luggage, not so much."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "If you're trying to connect two 50 lb suitcases together, this is not the strap to use. Look for the Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker, Black, One Size.This simple buckle and strap looks easy to use but it isn't. When you're in a hurry and you need to adjust the tension on this strap, you're fussing around with it in baggage claim. The Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker has extra \"tongue\" to quickly pull on (like a backpack strap) so you can clip, pull to tighten, and GO.This Lewis N Clark strap is good for light loads and smaller bags.  For larger ones, this one was a pain to use. You get what you pay for. Choke up the extra $5 and get the Travelon, you'll be glad you did."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "We got several of these before our overseas (by plane) trip.  They came in very handy for stacking the bags and luggage we had to manhandle through customs, airports, into taxis & B & Bs, etc.  They were very easy to use & sturdy, and I recommend every traveler carry a couple for unexpected needs (to bind more than one thing together for easy carrying).  I used one every day in the rental car to hang my bags on (hung it from the head rest) so items didn't get tossed and lost."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very fast shipping!Inflates easily and stayed inflated well.The elastic harness Velcros, so it's safe and it's gives a small 1/4\" adjust-ability to their size.They do stick out quite a bit from the sides of the child, but I think it adds to the excitement for the child.a lot of fun, The material is the same as that as a blow-up pool, so there is some durability, but seriously you have to expect that it can easily be punctured just the same if you are not careful."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This jet pack is easy to inflate, and my son can put it on himself. I like that it's inflatable, so my son can wear it as long as he wants, and then when it's time to take off, I can just deflate it, fold it up, and put it in my purse. The only problem we've encountered is that it rides up pretty high on my son's back, above his shoulders, so he keeps pulling it down lower, but it won't stay. It's pretty durable for an inflatable. My son crashes into things, the dog has stepped on it, but it still works."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered the jet pack for my 6 year old grandson for Halloween 2011 to go with his Buzz Lightyear costume.  Unfortunately, when we blew up the jet pack the day before Halloween and my grandson wore it for about an hour, it began to deflate quickly.  We found a hole but were unable to patch it up so that it stayed inflated since the break was in a crease in the plastic material.  Luckily, I was able to find and purchase another jet pack at a nearby store in my city which held up fine on Halloween."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These were great for my son's halloween costume.  Looks fantastic.  They are inflatable - I don't know if you can tell that from the picture.  You have to get them really inflated in order for the wings to stick out straight like they should.  My chief complaint is how the straps (very thin 1/4&#34; elastic) are attached to the jet pack.  It looks like they will break loose any moment.  Mine survived a halloween party and halloween itself, but I don't expect this to stand up to much more.  It did look great with the costume, though!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Purchased at Bagram Afghanistan PX in 2007 and this watch is a must-have for anyone treking into the mountains (of which I did, alot).  Over the years the watch has taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but, I still get a lot of comments about the watch.  The altimeter (incl the memory function) worked very well.  Battery replacement is easy (and has to occur about once a year).  The watch is a typical ABC watch, that looks good and does the job."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased the X-Lander Military version of this watch (all black, rubber strap).  I've scraped it across several hard objects, and it has yet to show scratches.  I love the compass and reverse display.  You have to be careful when setting up the watch, as it is easy to change the factory defaults on the barometer.  The elevation data seems to change constantly with barometric pressure, but I'm assuming that this is always the case with this type of instrument as its not tied to GPS.  My chief complaint is that the buckle is hard to unfasten (acutally, the tab that holds the end of the strap in place)."}

Out of all of the toys that my daughters have, this is the one that they would fight over the most, so for my youngest daughter's 3rd birthday I got her her very own \"First Purse\".  They both love playing with all of the included accessories, and often throw in a few additional items of their own.  The purses and accessories are all very durable, in fact, I had to put my daughters' initials on everything because I really can't tell the difference between the new items, and the items that we've had for a couple of years already.  Out of all of the little purses that I've looked at online and everywhere else, I definitely feel like this is the cutest and best deal out there."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The kids just love this. Why---no clue. I ordered it because my friend asked me to order it for her daughter, so I ordered 2---one for my daughter as well. We live in the caribbean, where it's hot, so a thick plush backpack is something you don't want to have on your back. The color is cute too, but I can see it easily getting soiled. I didn't let this backpack out of the house, and ended up giving it to another child.I liked the pull-out map feature that comes attached to it though. The flap stays closed with a magnetic closure. Good size."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got these for my daughter because I favor black Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star high-tops myself when I wear sneakers, and she likes to clomp around in them, so I thought I'd get her her own pair. Once she found out they come in pink, no other color would do.  Sigh.  But they are SUPER cute, and the lacing up the ankles means they fit tight and won't come off, but lots of room to grow through the toes.  One drawback, the laces are hard for a toddler to manage, and she has extreme difficulty getting them off by herself."}

(make sure if you are getting them as an alternative to a ladies dress shoe get the all blk w/ the all blk gumsole and all blk laces) Most dress shoes for ladies are very very uncomfortable even though they are fashionable and this one does both very well. The fact that I can machine wash makes them even more likeable."}

Original Chuck Taylor's are the biggest icon ever to hit sneakers, with the same bulletproof looks and simple construction throughout the years. They might offer zero arch support(easily fixed with a set of insoles), and can wear down a bit faster than newer brands, but there is no denying that, for the price paid, there's no finer example of what a sneaker is.With all of the new colors available, it has and will always be the king....buy a pair and find out for yourself why."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I didn't get my All-Stars on Amazon, but I wanted to write a review. I actually bought mine used on eBay about two years ago in June 2012. Like other reviews note, they do run large. I normally wear a size 10.5-11, but got a size 10 and they fit comfortably. I bought gray hi-tops with red trim. I initially got them for dead-lifting back when I trained with weights. Since then, I've been using them for casual wear and they've held up very well. I currently live in northern New Jersey and these shoes are nice for non-winter conditions. The shoe has eyelet vents, so when there's a lot of rain, snow or slush on the sidewalks, you may want to go with something else."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These shoes are worn very regularly by most of my family for nearly barefoot comfort. We like the colors and the look of them. I like the pink ones, because when I was a kid my mother told me I could be invisible in pink sneakers. I have 2 pairs of the high tops, one pair is 5 years old and while they are limp and a bit faded, the soles are still in decent condition. I also have a pair of the oxfords in raspberry rose which is just a fantastic pink color, and doesn't seem to be fading fast. My daughter loves her Skydiver Blue pair.They don't offer any support and they do run large. But as long as you aren't doing a lot of walking, they are very comfortable and light weight. I use my oxfords as slip ons with the laces tied a bit loose."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these for my eight year old little sister and she's loving them. She says they are very confortable, very bright and vivid color and loves showing them off. Her first pair of chucks! I'm a proud sister! Very good buy, arrived pretty quickly as well. Great stiching and laces (came with two pair-black and white) If you're getting these shoes to work in, I don't recommend. They are made tobe confortable but have very little sole support and the toes are kinda squished so perfect for little feet (like mine and sister's)  I have bought three pairs from this site, very great buy!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a great looking, simple looking sneaker or deck shoe in a variety of colors. I wear an 11 1/2 EW (EEE). These shoes were only offered in D widths, so I bought 12D. It fits my foot length and width, but it's a little tight from the top of my foot to the sole of my foot. I wear a 1/2\" lift in my left shoe, but it won't fit in this shoe. I wear this sneaker without my lift if I'm driving with only short walks outside the car. The soles don't afford much protection if I step on a walnut in my back yard - so I try not to do that. I bought these shoes in green and red. The first time I wore them, a young man passed me and said, \"Great Chucks.\""}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Chucks since I came out of the womb. I've been through many pairs, and after I decided to retire my old black ones due to a blown out heel I wanted to go with something new. The white is really an eye catching color, and more subdued in person than some of the pictures out there. BE WARNED, Chucks are about a size bigger than your actual shoe size. For example I wear a size 7 in women's, which would be a size 5 in Chucks, but these are really too big so I went with the size 4. I find the white adds some contrast, especially if you wear dark colors like I do."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these for my 13 yr old son.  They cost about the same price at the mall but it's always a plus when you can avoid going to the mall.  Chuck's run larger so you have to get a size smaller than what you would normally wear.  I found that out when I had to do a return and reorder.  Other than that, he seems to like his Chuck's.  I've bought a few more in different colors because he likes them so much."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this bra, fits tight and holds the girls in but i will say right after i got it one of the snaps broke off i think it was defective so now i have a bra i paid alot for that one hook can't be snapped but other then that i love it, i have went thru alot of bra's and this is by far the best support it is kinda hot and takes a little getting used to it is my first compresion bra, so that may be it for me, but i would say if you are larger busted try it, i just wish my bra would not have broke it would have got 5 stars if it had not broke. i was very disapointed in that but like i said not one of the other snaps have broke so i really think it was a defect of some kind."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm a very active person with a 34DDD chest.  I am forever on a search for the perfect bra.  For sports, this is it.  I can wear it in my highest impact activities, and everything stays put.  It's not really attractive, and sure doesn't look great with a spaghetti strap work out top, but it does the job.  Getting into it is a little tricky; you start at the bottom hook and work your way up, adjusting your breasts as you go.  It is supposed to feel tight, so you might think you have the wrong size at first.  But after wearing it for a few minutes it feels comfortable.  ZERO bounce or movement.  Incredible!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, I normally wear a 40 band bra, and an F/G cup depending on the brand. In a Lane Bryant Full Coverage bras I wear a 40DDD. I followed the measurements and this bra holds very well, but I have spillage at the sides and the top. The band fit correctly and I honestly feel if I went up a size the band would be too big. For myself I will seek a bra with cups and not numbers. This bra is awesome if you are a 40 DD, (40 DDD the biggest) as the sizing chart states. I give credit to the fact that for the cup sizes provided was correct. I guess my &#34;girls&#34; are just way too big. I will keep it and wear a compression vest on top of it.  My measurements did fit a size 4 though, so for ladies looking for some serious hold, definitely get this."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra is very durable and I love the thick straps that do not cut into my shoulders - LOVE IT!  However, the measurement method and sizes will not always be correct, as the recommended way to measure may be correct but the sizes recommended are not.I did the measurements as instructed and was given a size to buy and the cups are way too small - my breasts are spilling out on the sides.  Some may be wanting to say go a size bigger but if I do, the bra will be too slack, as it is the bra is very comfortable but the cups are way off.  I need a bra just like this but with bigger cups.  Any recommendations?"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this bra not with sports in mind.  This is not a 'pretty, feminine' bra. As a large busted woman, I was tired of being disappointed with ill fitting bras. I needed the back/posture support and ample coverage.  This bra provides both--however the drawbacks are: 1)the straps are not long enough for me and 2) It gives you that 'minimizer bra' look. Nice wide straps and it provides cleavage coverage.  You may want to wear a tank or camisole with lower/open neck tops."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased this due to the good reviews it has on Amazon. I plan to use it for long day trips, weekend trips, and vacations. It has plenty of room, separate sections, and extras that will work out great for holding all kinds of stuff! I can't wait to use it! I have smaller bags like this where the strap goes across the body, and I prefer that when traveling or walking around all day long, but I definitely needed a bigger one (but not too big - haha). I feel safer knowing it can't be stolen from me and it is also more comfortable to wear. It is made well and I like that the material will repel water. Great bag!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My wallet appears  to be a taupe color. The colors I would  have preferred were out of stock. Having said that, there is nothing wrong with the color I got. It isn't fully leather so don't yet know how long it will last. It comes with a check book cover which can be removed. Haven't any cash, so can't tell how happy it would be in the compartments, but my credit card and insurance etc cards seem perfectly happy :). I especially like that the ID view pocket has a hole in the center which makes it much easier to get you DL out when needed."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Good quality, handy and functional, no bells and whistles just a leather product that works.  I like the coin compartment being on the outside and available without having to open up the whole thing.  I don't like the zipper coin compartments because they don't open wide enough so this is just right.  And the style and color is nice/classy.  It also has a check book holder inside and about 5 credit card slots.  The place designated for your driver's license has a cut-out in the center of the plastic to help get hold of it to take it out when needed which is handy.  It also has a zipper compartment inside to store stuff you want to keep but don't use as much.  Very nice."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered this wallet on a Friday, and I received it the following Tuesday, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I ordered the red one, because red is my favorite color. It is VERY nicely made. Very roomy, has LOTS of places to carry cards etc. The leather is nice and soft to the touch. I think that I am going to be VERY pleased with this wallet for years to come. It also came in a very nice box, so that if anyone were getting it for a gift for someone it would be easy to wrap."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just ordered this item for my wife as a gift.  She was very happy with this product.  I don't know anything about it, sinceI don't carry one of these.  All I can advise to the customers is, what she said about this product.  She stated that itwas a well known brand, and she liked the soft leather and the well organized compartments in the billfold.  She reallyliked the quality and the full rich color of the leather.She advised that, a product such as this, is hard to find in the department stores locally.  She was very pleased with thelooks and color, and the percise arrangement and the design.  Must be a good one, she is very happy with it.The picture and decription of this item, is right on the money, on the sellers page............."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This clutch wallet passed my expectations, very happy with this wallet.  The color and suede feel is a great plus. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great clutch wallet at a reasonable price.  In similar products, other clutch book wallets would not have as much available space, for all items needed to be placed in the wallet.  The size can fit into any pocketbook without the bulge when filled, a deep pocket, or used as a carry-along without pocketbook.  This clutch is great, and would not be a disappointment to anyone who is looking for this type of wallet.  I Love It!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have had several zip around clutch wallets and it is the style I prefer.  The color is not fire engine red just a nice red color.  The leather is medium soft with a nice feel to it.  Love all the card holding spots and the area for a check book is easily used for something else. The snap closure is handy and keeps everything in place, you can access your money without having to open the clutch,  just  open the zippered area. Having a zipper change pocket on the side is so handy or you can use the zipper pocket in the zip around.  When all filled I still found this Buxton clutch to be fairly slim.  I'm very pleased with this clutch and would buy it again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These don't give me much support but I did not really expect them to. I wear a 32D and ordered a size C they covered perfectly. I feel like this may work better if you are fuller on top. I'm fuller on bottom and the tabs just pull the skin and makes me look wrinkly. They did give me some support, however they also made a strange cone shape and made me look quite pointy. I would wear these with something that already has some support or is a thicker fabric. However, they will definitely come in handy with certain outfits and would be perfect for a special occasion dress that already has some structure."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is my second garter from Rago and it's amazing. If you're looking for shapewear, this is the brand you want. Don't bother with Spanx, they're not gonna hold you in. They'll smooth all the lines, but this one will give you the firmed up, 1950s look. I work at a 1950s clothing shop and I'm not the only girl who wears Rago!Also, I'm a petite girl and Rago has sizes for me. Shapewear in smaller sizes can be difficult to come across.Anyway, Rago is an amazing brand, please don't hesitate to get something from them. &#60;3"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a rago 1359 obg every day. with it on I have a flat tummy again. Wearing a girdle does meanwearing panties under (Vanity Fair Nylon Rivissant) - to help put it on and stockings (Berkshire It Fits)toprevent ride up. Dressing in the morning takes a bit of time but my girdle does stays in place. At first it is tight, then comfortable, and then I forget that I have it on. I do not have that girdled look and I really dolook better with my girdle on."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So, I love the idea here, but there are some considerations. First, the S/M is more for training bras or people who are very small/petite. So, I wish they would just call it Small rather than S/M. I think most women would need the Large/XL, even though it sounds big, I think it suit more people.Second, the right fit is important because if it's too tight, the part that grabs the back of your bra straps starts to cinch the strap, so you have two, tiny bunches by your shoulder blades that stick out like little bumps on your back.Finally, the clips do slip once in a while, so there is a chance they'll come undone. Then you'll have a swinging strap on your back.Again, I like the idea here, and it's better more often than not. But it's not as revolutionary as I thought it would be. :)  I'm still waiting for a better solution."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Having previously purchased a Shadowline long gown in 2002....I was in desperate need of a new one...with red being my favorite of colors, this was a no brainer.

{"label": 8, "raw": "Very nice bra, but the material is a bit stiff, which keeps the girls where they're supposed to be, though. It'll give a pointy shape, which is not very flattering with regular t-shirts, but will add some lift with \"flowy\" tops.BE AWARE: even though it says that this item qualifies for free returns, you will have to pay for the shipping costs if you want to return this bra!!! Amazon customer rep told me it's because the product is not sold/fulfilled by Amazon itself, but by a 3rd party. It puzzles me why Amazon mentions free returns on the product page when it doesn't apply  to that specific product. On a product that doesn't cost much, having to pay for return shipping is quite a waste."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was looking for a casual bra to wear when I worked in the yard and chose this one based on reviews and price.  It's going back.The bra is thin with old fashioned pointed nipples.  The material fails to stretch to adapt to breast dimensions, causing some areas to be too tight and others too loose.  It felt uncomfortable (not too tight - just too rough) as soon as I put it on.Because it's a Bali, it's probably durable and would hold up over time better than cheaper bras but I just can't get over the positive reviews so I'm giving it only one star.For a better fitting and much more comfortable bra, try a Victoria's Secrets wireless cotton bra.  It gives you the smooth coverage you want, excellent support, and you won't even know you are wearing it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This isn't as 'sexy' as some bras, but it looks GREAT under clothes, and is supportive without feeling constrictive. Sometimes when this is sold in outlets, something is 'off' in the material; it's a little scratchy....but from Bali or as this was sold from Amazon, it's l00% right.  Washes well and lasts so much better than some of the fragile bra fabrics.  Maybe not so special for 'date night', but for a great bra to wear all week, it's terrific."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was doing a lot of reading online.  And the bras with the best support are seamed bras.  Most of the new seamless bras are overly padded and flatten me out.I looked at my local stores but it's very hard to find a seamed bra that isn't a minimizer in huge sizes.  Most start in D cups.This is an attractive bra visually and I would normally just order up one size,  but I look like I should be the musical \"Grease.\"  Or in a 1950's TV show.My husband said I was a walking weapon in this thing.  I could use my breasts to poke the eyes out of a potential attacker.It does not look like the photo of it on amazon.  Anyone who put this on, would have to push their breasts into the front of the narrow part of the cup to fill it, and would end up looking pointy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra does provide support & lift, but it is not 'seamless'.  This bra is part of the Bali &#34;Classics&#34; collection, so it's been around for a long time.The cup isn't a stretchy type of fabric, so you can see a little of the cup material through my tops.  And, you can see a little of the cup seam (slightly).I just bought Bali Passion For Comfort Minimizer Underwire Bra, and that one is seamless-  that one is a stretchy type of material.  It smooths out over the breast.  So, you won't see the cups through your tops with that one-  although that bra fits a bit more snug."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm 56 yrs old. Size 34DD. There are only two bras that I can wear. This is one of them. Amazon is a great place to purchase it as the price is less expensive than stores (Kohls rarely has my size in stock) and it seems to always be in stock. I hope Bali keeps on making this bra. Within the last year I did have an issue with a bra (a piece broke) but I called Bali and they replaced it for free.....UPDATE..this has happened twice....the adjustment pieces on the straps are made of thin plastic. Thin plastic to hold up DDs??????? Cheap."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "38DDD.  I wasted way too many years buying Lilyette.  Lilyette quality has diminished dramatically over the past year and I was concerned about finding an alternative.  I tried the Bali Satin Tracings Minimizer and was pleasantly surprised.  The Bali is rather comfortable. Washes well.  Life-span is average.  You'll know when to buy new when you feel the fit change.It is also a 10X better minimizer than any other bra I've tried.  In fact, I used to need apparel tape to keep the front of my blouses from gapping.  With the Bali, my clothes fit perfectly without needing that bothersome tape.  Hopefully, they will make this bra forever and leave it just the way it is...don't change the fabric, don't change anything to make it &#34;new and improved&#34;."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I think I will like it better once its washed several times and stretches just a little.  I have had these before and found the same thing.  If they offered half sizes, I would have gotten a half size larger.  I know the next size up does not fit...its too big, BUT this is a nice bra, does a good job of minimizing.  It does go up a little into my arm pits, but I don't think that will bother me after it softens up a bit.  Like the straps and shape of cups.  Well made.  I would love to find a bra that I give 5 starts to but probably will not in my lifetime."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have very narrow shoulders so my bra straps constantly need hiking up. Many years ago, I finally found a Wacoal that stays put but it no longer fits and is being discontinued. I have tried every single other brand on the planet and they all slip off so I got this to hold them in place. It works perfect. I wish I didn't have the extra bump across my back but it's better than constantly reaching in my shirt to pull up slipping straps. I like that it is adjustable, too."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is too expensive for the cheap quality of this product! Because the plastic is so slippery, when you put it on the back of your bra and attempt to adjust it to your liking, as soon as you begin to raise your bra straps onto your shoulders, the little adjustment clip will slip/revert back to the starting point of where you begin when you tried to adjust it. I can see this happening if I were over weight and/or had large breast, but Im a size 8 and a B cup so this shows you how defunct this product is. Furthermore, the company I bought this from here on Amazon (i.e. Lady Grace) has an outrageous shipping cost! This piece of crap should be half the cost to ship but the company charges an unreasonable shipping fee because they make you pay for them to mail you their unwelcomed catalog (along with this cheap gadget) which I threw in the recycling bin as soon as I got it. Total waste :-("}

I normally wear barely there, and this one was very creamy. Although this isnt something i would wear on a normal basis, it did go really well with my black skirt w/ white feathery sweater top. I wouldn't dare wearing it with any other though, just not my color; Too bright. It was a nice try though."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I think a color labeled &#34;Barely There&#34; should be much more neutral.

The shades depicted online are not at all representative. Cannot speak to fit or durability as I haven't tried them on yet."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Ok ladies, pantyhose, in general, are getting difficult to find anymore.  Many women hate them.  But, for those of us that don't have a problem with them, it seems as though there are expensive tights or leggings to choose from, and no more 'pantyhose'.  Let alone NAVY.  This is the real deal.  I plan on buying more for my 'stash'.  These are the tried and true navy pantyhose and I keep a few pair in my desk for that occasional runner that might happen once every other year.  You get what you pay for, and these are a bargain for the quality.  Love them!  Thanks for carrying, Amazon.  Now, I can save gas money from running all over the place looking for navy hose."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm accustomed to push up bras because of my lack of endowment, so this was definitely something different. Straps are nice and thick. Back band is wide. Front portion lays flat underneath bra instead of tilting up. Cups themselves are two layers of lace that support nicely but do not form the breast as a padded bra might. Will not hide *ahem* signs of 'cold weather'. Middle portion does tend to press into the chest. My boyfriend will love it when he gets back from the holidays."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I found the band to be a little bit snug, but it otherwise fits pretty much as expected.  However, don't be fooled by the picture for this item.  Unless you have naturally perky breasts or you would actually wear a half size and size down, your breasts are not going to sit that high in the cup.  As with all demi bras, beware: any upper chest side boob fat you may have will be smushed into adorable little rolle, in a most unfortunate and highly visible manner.  Don't buy this bra if you are carrying 20lbs extra or more.  You will not be happy with the results."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was so excited for this bra and when I got the 38D  the wire part fit great and actually supported ALL of my boob instead of cutting in too close on the sides.  The cups were just a TAD too big, and I could have gotten it tailored I suppose but I returned them for a 38C hoping that, being a 38, the underwire would still be wide enough too include all my bits but have correct cup size....cup size was alright, but the underwire was too narrow AND the underwire that came up between the boobs was too wide!  It was like pulling my boobs apart from the center!  No thanks!  Plus, it pushed really hard into my sternum!  The material was super scratchy and uncomfortable, I just wished this worked out b/c from the picture it looks so pretty but the material is awful."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra is beautifully made and quite supportive. I'm large-busted (anywhere between a 32DDD and H, depending on brand/maker) and chose to try a 34DDD for this bra since cups run small on most brands that aren't specifically for large chests, and this item doesn't come larger than DDD. It turns out to be a little large in the cup, which almost never happens to me! But the support seems good and the bra is both delicate and sexy while still providing coverage. I'll be returning for a smaller size."}

I first ordered 3 size 8s and they are somewhat large so went back on Amazon, checked the sizing charts then ordered 3 size 7s.  There is at least 2 or more inches difference in the width of these two sizes and the 7 is more than an inch shorter.  I can't complain about the quality of Jockey, but sizing is a totally separate issue.  The size 7s will be donated to Goodwill ASAP."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered these Jockey underpants after talking with a friend, who really likes these undies.  I ride horses and have issues with rubs from the saddle with almost any other underpants I have tried.  This brand fixed my rub problem. I like the covered elastic legs and the high leg cut design. What I did not like is the fact that one color (dark gray) shrank two sizes when I first washed it.  The other colors did not shrink (white and heather gray).  The company says shrinkage is about 10%, but my experience is that shrinkage is more, particularly from top to bottom, rather than shrinking around.  Jockey has also offered to let me return the pair that shrank excessively."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love simple white underwear.  Easy to wash, easy to bleach to get that nice clean look.  Cotton is breathable and comfortable.

I use the more worn pairs when I go on vacation or on a business trip, and then just throw them away instead of having to come home and wash them...:)These are not the most longest lasting underwear ever, but I sure like them right out of the package.  Which is important.  If you have to wash them for weeks before you like them, what a waste!Nothing fancy or sexy about these, but they are quality and comfortable."}

{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been using this string bikini for over 30 years....then, department stores stopped carrying them because they \"don't sell as well\". Now, I found them online and I am back wearing them. They are ALL cotton-therefore breathable and comfortable besides looking good on you as they are nicely-styled (read \"sexy\", the picture with model's tummy facing the right does them more justice). My dermatologist recommends all-cotton panties. And these are that and look great..NO granny panties! The cotton-encased elasting band is VERY comfortable, keeps its elasticity even when the product wears out finally and protects skins afflicted with latex intolerance (my problem) or allergy. The bikni over all is sturdy and lasts and lasts. I highly recommend them. I thank Jockey for still making them."}

They're warm and durable like tights but have a really sexy semi sheer, shimmery look to them like luxury pantyhose. .Great to wear with a mini and heels to really show off  your legs and they'll still keep you  warm.They  fit fantastic and are very comfortable to wear for long days.They also give your legs support,  feels like you wearing leggs sheer energy pantyhose . I've  tried a lot of  tights and these are one of the best and the price is reasonable.Love them!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "You can't beat the quality of Spanx as long as you accept that you MUST order two sizes larger than the chart says you need. You will never get them on otherwise. (And if you do get them on, you'll be miserable.) Order two sizes up and they'll still be snug and hold down the jiggles. You'll feel confident and comfortable. These are perfect under skirts to keep you cool and prevent thighs from rubbing together. They also keep the skirt from sticking to your behind after you've been sitting. They're still a challenge to get on - especially after using a public restroom where you don't have a lot of room. Also, I can see where they'd be easy to snag with a rough fingernail or ring, so be careful. I really wish they'd make them in more sizes for larger bodies, but overall, they are awesome and worth the price."}

It is made with mobile babies in mind, not one hole. The top fit well on his head over top of a beanie (I put the beanie on first for a while till he was used to it, then added the top) he didn't even notice it (until the top would flip down, but to really a problem, flips back and is pretty sturdy) ."}

Other than that, I love the Kangaroo pouch style.  For years I've worn Munsingwear's Kangaroo pouch briefs, but reviews on their latest product have not been good now that they're made in China, so I was happy to find Jockey making this style brief.  I'm very happy with the quality... just should have ordered the larger size...."}

I have a couple larger bags that -technically- hold more, but in some weird configuration so that I'm always packing and unpacking.  Domke bags are designed by a photographer for photographers, and it shows.  I started filling this bag, and just 'knew' where to put everything - and I don't have to remove more than one item to get to whatever I need.  Comes out of the box looking a bit 'lived in', and not obviously a camera bag, which is a plus when traveling.  The metal clips that back up the velcro top closure could be easier to manipulate, but -- great bag!"}

They were delivered super fast and I got a really good deal on them since I bought them in children's size. I am a size 7 (sometimes a 6.5) in women's and I got these shoes in a children's size 5.5. They fit great! They're kind of heavy, so it takes a while to get used to walking in them but they look amazing. These shoes are very durable and great quality, so you can tell that they'll last for a long time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Merrell's WERE great, perhaps when they were made in Canada. These are identical in stated sizing to a wonderful pair of Merrell Jungle Moc's I wore comfortably in and out of the house for years, but my heel slipped a lot in these, there was way too much toe room, and they seemed 1/2 to 1 size too large. I wear a 9.5 US Merrell but these felt like 10-10.5's. I had to return them for properly fitting and comfortable Teva's. I do not recommend these, I would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I must like these shoes, this is my fourth pair, and they're all still in use. I discovered Merrell's hiking shoes maybe 10-12 years ago, and always found them to be well made, durable and comfortable. The jungle mocs continue the tradition, and add the convenience of being a slip-on. This makes them my go-to shoes for a run out to the mailbox, for any activity that involves walking, yard work (the oldest pair), etc. They are also good looking enough for business casual wear at the office, going well with khakis or jeans on casual Friday."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Merrells for a while and highly suggest them for anyone that has trouble finding comfortable shoes. I must say that I prefer the Jungle Moc Nubuck, Brown Nubuck but it seems that the Brown Nubuck  are being discontinued for the present time and it's hard to find the Brown Nubuck. I decided to try Men's Merrell Jungle Moc Leather, Mahogany Brown and was very satisfied with every thing but the color. The Merrell Jungle Moc Leather, Mahogany Brown is not mahogany at all, not even close but rather a tan looking color. Beware that the Mahogany Brown as shown in the picture is not the correct color. It is a very light brown or tan colored shoe. I almost sent them back but the return time frame closed on me. If you like a lighter colored shoe this is a great and comfortable shoe. I do like the new sole on this shoe. It has a better grip support sole that the older Merrells. It is made of all smooth leather and not suede like most other Merrells."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This shoe is extremely comfortable, looks good and is convenient.  Slips on and slips off.  No laces to tie or untie.  Really great for traveling and going thru those irritating TSA checkpoints at the airports.  The seller however I can not recommend.  When I orderd my Merrells, the seller had them listed as in stock, yet it took two emails...the second one threatening cancellation to finally get them shipped two weeks later.  BTW...this is my second pair.  The first pair were bought for me at a Merrell Store in Birmingham, Alabama and they are still going strong.  Just wanted another color."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Wow, these are just SO comfortable to wear.  I've worn so many different kinds of shoes over the years.  A $400 pair of dress shoes may have some comfort when on your feet for ten hours, but these are just like walking on air.  I've put on a few pounds and my feet are not as forgiving as in my youth, but these are some of the most comfortable footwear I've ever worn!  In a weeks time I've had three strangers stop me and ask about them, and another two have said, they own 'em and yes, it isn't just me, these Merrell Jungle Mocs are truly comfortable.  I've never recommended shoes before, but I'd recommend considering these for real comfort."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "After laughing the whole way home from the mall after seeing what looked like clown shoes for $150 or more I was glad to find these on Amazon.  Ok, I admit I'm in my mid forties but I'm sorry the multicolored goofball shoes I saw didn't impress me much, they just look ridiculous.  These however have a simple clean look and are some of the best fitting athletic shoes I've ever owned.  I like a snug fit and these fit like a glove.  You might not be the gym peacock but your workout won't suffer."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This was purchased for my 4 year old to wear when we took him to see the new Superman movie. The quality is what you would expect from a packaged halloween costume that is meant to be worn for one day. The S on the chest started peeling on one corner after a few days of wear. My son is obsessed with super heros so he wears this costume around the house almost daily. The stitching for the velcro on the belt came loose and had to be repaired. For the price I paid for this, we have got our money's worth out if it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "We wanted the costume that didn't have all the bulk in it.  This was perfect.  My son is 4 and it was a little big, but I just think- hey, he can wear it to play in for a good year or so.  He'll get lots of wear out of this.  It would be nice if the boot covers fit tighter, but they were good enough! Easy on and off...we actually had a whole outfit on under it to keep warm, so there's your muscle bulk, if that's what you want."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So I lusted after Rainbows for about 7 years before I decided they might be worth the money.-I got a large (I wear 9.5M) and my foot went right to the edge, so I got an extra-large.-The wear in period wasn't so bad, I did get a blister as expected.-My largest problem is that the foot surface area got so smooth that my foot kep sliding in and out of the shoe, and it dried out and rubbed up against my foot. I feel like it was polishing the bottom of my foot.-I feel like they are going to fall off when I walk-I thought there was going to be a bit more arch support.-The bottom is very hard.All in all they are good looking sandals, but I've tried on a friend's REEFs and they were incredibly comfortable. If I could go back in time, I would have gone with the REEFs."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "If you are looking for the Reeboks that were made in the 80's and 90's, this is not it.  The first pair I ordered in the size I have worn for decades was too short and way too tight thru the toe area.  Ordered a half a size larger and they were still tight thru the toe area and the heel area is too large, but the length was right.  I had to use inserts in the heels and put them in a stretcher to make the toe area comfortable.  Will not be ordering these shoes anymore."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I had a pair of Reebok Hi-Top sneakers years ago and wore them to threads.  I hadn't seen any locally and had basically given up, until stumbling upon them on Amazon.  I was delighted to get another pair.I remembered, and I'm glad I did, that these shoes run on the small and narrow side.  I normally wear a size 9, but went up a half size to 9.5.  And, they fit perfectly, with room for a light, gel type orthopedic insert, which I think is necessary because the footbed is not very cushioned.  There is moderate arch support.I know many younger folks like Hi-Tops as a fashion statement.  I really like them for the ankle support, particularly with this shoe because the double velcro straps provide for necessary adjustments for perfect comfort.These shoes are a blast from the past.  I may have to spring for a pair in black for the upcoming fall/winter."}

I'm not giving it only 3 stars for that reason however, but rather for the overall rough feeling material that the jacket is made of.  The label says &#34;Made in Mexico of US Fabrics&#34; but not sure what fabrics they were actually using, definitely not something that is going to be taken care of in a few washings.  If you want a rough and tough jacket where comfort is not an issue, then this might be the right one for you- but if you are looking for a casual outdoors type jacket that isn't stiff or uncomfortable, keep shopping."}

It didnt look as good as this one but it was much more comfortable after being washed several times and lasted years with heavy use.If you buy this jacket, wash it first thing to loosen it up a little bit.I strongly recommend Carhart clothing, but there is compromise with comfort for long wear and warmth.My recommendation is this jacket below:http://www.amazon.com/Carhartt-Mens-Duck-Active-Thermal-Lined/dp/B002WLOK1U/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&s;=apparel&qlEnable;=1&qid;=1284079028&sr;=1-16"}

The problem was the weight allowed was only 8KG (about 17 lbs) for the porters carry, therefore even extra pairs of socks were a bad item to haul. She carried 4 pairs of these socks and they did an amazing job of keeping her feet clear of all the sweat and ensured that she suffered no blisters doing about 8-9 hours of walking at that altitude.She wears shoes- Timberlands 7.5M and Reeboks US 9.5- probably due to the differences in widths. These socks fit upto US 9.5 for men perfect, and if you are 10+ then these may not be for you.All in all, she recommends this for any prolonged wear and for closed shoes, unlike track/sports shoes, where ventilation could be in issue. Absolute recommended buy."}

They are very thick- so make sure your shoes can accommodate them- but aside from that caveat, these should not give you any trouble, and at least for my shoe size, the fit was perfection."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Ordered two pairs, same size. First pair fits with plenty of room, second pair I can't even button and they're too short. Both say the waist is a 33... Looks like more people are having this problem, likely has something to do with the quality control of their new outsourced plant. Won't be buying these off Amazon anymore, seeing as the size is basically a complete guess. Would recommend buying them in store where you can try on the pants first to make sure they fit. Waited too long and now I can't return them. Great pants, just wish they'd fit. This is the second time I've been disappointed with Carhartt in the last two months."}

I wear a basic cotton T-shirt  under these.If you have a beer belly or chest measures larger than a 42&#34; regular suit a Large will probably be a better fit, also if you are going to wear over thermal shirt or sweater underneath go with the Large.I'm Carhartt brand loyal, I try to buy on sale, Henley was just over $20 so not much discount but Carhartt sells out - here on Amazon and in western wear stores - even if you pay full price you won't regret it.  If the shirt fits buy it in every color!"}

The long sleeves ones are great to layer in winter . The material is almost as heavy as tent canvas but soft as it is cotton . They are generous to size but do order your regular one because air pockets are good insulators as well as aid in wicking moisture and drying  . They shrink a tad . Carhartt's are absolutely the best but you do have to pay up for them . They are worth it . If a thinner material will do I will try other quality brands like Key's or St Johns Bay if their on sale but truth be told the Carhartt's are best . They stain less and the same goes for other wear and tear. I have found it is better to not use bleach when washing these .Good luck"}

He has about 6-8 tees that all look something that are not even fit for the rag bag, that he wears regularly. Those shirts are thread bare with various rips. The carhart still has good material density after 5 years but the neck and shirt tail are definitely worn. It seems stains come out a little easier too... That's not right, the stains don't set as fast on a carhart tee as they do like on a hanes. Don't know if it the tighter fabric weave or special finish.We love them."}

The sizes are so different, I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear, but when they were delivered and I tried them on, it was as if they were two sizes smaller. The material is thin, and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be.

Sadly they were still at least 2 sizes too small!  He was soooo disappointed to have to return these and purchase an brand other than carhartt.

Wont buy anything else.Side note, these jeans fit very tight. If you are looking for a wrangler type regular fit, get the relaxed fit carhartt jeans.**EDIT** these jeans fit really oddly. super tight in the hips and butt but loose in the thigh and knees.

Again, quality looks on point though. I will update if there is a fade to the jeans."}

Shoes pretty good overall. Good feel and fit, works well with my stride.Couple of minor dings:1. Color of actual shoe closer to a brown, rather than the greyish khaki of the picture2. Collar of the shoe has a shallower angle compared to my other shoes, so it rubs against my ankle bone. It's a padded collar so it's not too bad, but could get irritating over a long day.3. Stock insoles were pretty thin.Modifications:A. Replaced insoles with Dr. Scholl gel inserts, although may have to find a thicker insole or double up to avoid ding #2 aboveB. Sprayed the shoes with a Camp Dry equivalent.If I remember, I'll post an after-action report when I return from my trip."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Have used Rockport's for years.  They use to be top of the line for comfort, yet look dressy enough to wear in the office.  Comfort, quality, and value......but something changed.  I bought a brown and black pair of this model.  They are wearing faster than the older models and are NOT as comfortable.  When you notice that you are wearing shoes that is usually a clue that something is not right.  The old Rockports you could put on and walk in all day and never think about your shoes or your feet.  Not so with this stiffer version.  Sadly looks like when these wear out will have to try to find a more comfortable shoe."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These shoes have the most inferior insole of any walking shoe. If you want to add a decent insole, you won't have much breathing room for your foot. The shoes overall aren't as comfortable as everybody is saying, but I have a slightly wide foot. I am fine when I wear my New Balance shoes with a width of D. I do believe that this shoe isn't what it used to be. They are a decent pair of shoes for someone on a budget. I bought theRockport Men's Ct Sport Oxfordwhen I bought these, and highly suggest those. Those shoes have a much better insole, and the shoe breathes well."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These Rockports are very much like well-made, socially-acceptable versions of athletic shoes.  They are very flexible, take no time to break in, provide good traction, and look almost like a pair of dress oxfords.  Because they are nicely padded -- which adds to the comfort -- they tend to look a little blocky, so that they're probably not your cup of tea if you're looking for stylish dress shoes.  But for going on a cruise -- where you want to wear a single pair of your size 13 shoes and not have to pack extras, and will be walking a lot -- these are wonderful."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a replacement pair for one that I have been wearing for years! These shoes are comfortable right out of the box - no break-in period. The nubuck finish is a bit suede like, but not as fussy, I like the look and the color. I notice an inconsistency in the inner-sole of one of the shoes. The foot feels a very slight but annoying change in sole thickness just in back of the toes. When I ordered an additional pair in black, that same inconsistency was even more evident in one of the shoes - so I returned that pair. Be aware of the error - you may need to return them as well if the feel is apparent to you.Based on my last pair, I expect these will last beyond my interest period. At some point you just want a new pair of shoes and these things refuse to die! I use them for everyday use for all but dressy occasions."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "We bought a pair for an older child who wore out lesser, cheaper brands in a few months. With one brand we had trouble with the rubber sole separating from the rest of the sandal. Sometimes you could fix it with Shoe Goo, sometimes not. I recognized Columbia as a good brand and bought a pair on the large side, since he is still growing. So far we're doing fine. One can tell by inspection it is a much better sandal than sandals selling for half the price. So, though it is more expensive than some other brands at department stores, I think this is a good value in the long run. Comfortable and attractive, too."}

Instead they look like they were washed with something that bled into the brown threads and I guess it was the dark fleece lining that did it...because the pants were washed alone. They are still wearable. They just look a little odd now. But for around the house and yard, walking dogs, hunting - they'll be fine."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear these in the yard and when working in the cold and snow and I love them. They really do help keep me warm in the wind.I wear a 38 x 30 or 32 depending on the cut and style of jean. In work boots these are the perfect length for a person who normally wears a 30 length. The same is true of the width, I am usually a perfect 38 and these fit really well.When I need a pair of jeans for wearing after work I will be looking at Wrangler. Very impressed."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Problem is I put it on the ground and it moves when you put your shoe through it.  It has screws to mount it but I can not use that application. I need it for anyone who passes through my gate at the backyard and it seems a bit narrow for the shoes we use. It is truly a \"Boot Brush\" with the high sides which would be fine for a work boot or sneaker but I would do better with a straight across brush since we use flip flops and sandles much of the time and the sides are too high for those type of shoes."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is an excellent shoe scraper.  However, to work effectively, it needs a base, which is not easy to attach.  Apparently you can remove the bottom brushes and use the drill holes, which I did not figure out.  I screwed a piece of scrap board into the bottom brushes from below (through the drill holes), which works fine, but requires fairly exact measurement.  The board extends @ 9 inches to each side of the brush.  I stand on the board with my off foot so that it is firmly anchored when I brush each shoe.The fit is very tight, which is necessary for the brush to remove debris thoroughly.  I suspect that reviewers who complain of the tight fit for large shoes have not attached an anchoring board.The product would be improved by the inclusion of instructions for attaching an anchor board.Because I have a small back porch, I have to keep the apparatus a few feet away on a paved surface."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold, they are still quite affordable.The stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything.  They stand out on the lobe and I was worried they'd be really small, but they are not.  In spite of the decent size of the stones, these are really lightweight and you can't tell you're wearing them, at all.I think these would make an excellent gift and I'm considering buying an additional pair, just for that purpose!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm very pleased with this purchase, especially having bought them during an Amazon sale.  The blue is clear and bright, the setting is secure, and they fit well on the ears.  The post is a little higher than center so I often find myself turning them to be sure they are falling correctly, but it really doesn't make a difference.  The white gold really complements the blue and I much prefer these set in white rather than yellow gold because of the very cool color of the stones.  For those who have light colored eyes, these are especially complementary.  I have received numerous compliments when wearing these and I wear these very, very often, sometimes not removing them for weeks at a time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Of all the earrings I received for Christmas these were my favorite. Maybe because I bought them for myself. Nice, simple and smallish gold hoops. They are not as big as you would expect judging by the picture shown. After doing a little research on duragold (because really, what is it?) it appears to have a slightly lower percentage of gold in it and reportedly the strongest gold alloy ever. Whatever that is. Still, I love these except the post is a little long and gets caught on my clothes. I'd buy them again and I would buy them as a gift."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These 14K gold hoops are about the diameter of a dime  1/2 inch, and the width is about 1/4 inch.  The hoops seem sturdy, the catch looks fragile.  I did wear them for a week nonstop and they never came undone.  But I imagine taking them on and off repeatedly might eventually be an issue with the fragile looking catch.  These would be great for a child, and good for a women when she doesn't want a large hoop.  These have a post that sticks out a bit in the back, so they are not as comfortable as a hoop where the clasp goes inside the hoop. But it wasn't nearly  as uncomfortable as a butterfly back post because the post tends to hang downward rather than poking  straight back. They have a polish finish, and are a good choice for a small unobtrusive but substantial looking earring."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "When I received these, they looked like good quality and the latch looked secure. I wore them to work (I have a desk job) and lost one the first day. Fortunately for me, the cleaning lady helped me look for it and managed to find it on the floor in the office. Now I'm scared to wear them again. I have another pair of sterling silver hoops that have this same type of latch. I've worn them for years, and they've never fallen out of my ears. I can't help but be disappointment with a pair of earrings when one falls out of my ear on the first day, especially when I did not do anything to cause it to fall out."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "UPDATE  I've owned these earrings for 7 years.  I wear them often and they look as good as the day they arrived from Amazon in 2007.  Perfect 14K yellow gold color, not brassy-looking at all like some gold is, they are the perfect size - 1\" in diameter.  Well made, yet light in gram weight, the post snaps shut with a nice click and doesn't feel like they will easily come unsnapped.  The hinge seems to be high-quality and strong too.  They are the perfect earring for me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm a typical guy that is basically clueless about jewelry, but I can certainly appreciate the ease of buying something on Amazon as opposed to going to a jewelry store and dealing with salespeople trying to push expensive products. My favorite move is when they take out their calculator and magically apply some unknown discount to what may or may not be a sticker price. My wife absolutely loved these earings - I don't know exactly why - but if your loved one is asking for gold hoop earrings these are the real deal."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased these on a gold box whim.  They are larger than I expected, and the rose color is not really discernible.  They look yellow gold to me.Yes, I'll probably keep them and no, I wouldn't recommend them to others.  They are much too large for second ear piercings.  They aren't the style I usually wear.  So far, the backs have securely held them in each ear and the posts are reasonable diameter.  They appear to be adequately made, but don't really look like high quality earrings."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The ball earrings are beautiful and I was very disappointed to find that the posts are so short, what you would expect to find on earrings for a small child.  The posts were also thin, but that was okay.  Also, the tension backs were so tiny, I had a hard time handling them.  If I had purchased them for the Jan 2007 price, I might have kept them and had new posts and backs put on by my local jeweler.  The photo shows the posts and backs to be more substantial.  Sadly, I have to return them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are such a great size, are nice and shiny, and have a good weight to them.  I'm super happy with this purchase.  However, the backs are completely useless.  They just slide on and off, up and down the post--there is no catch whatsoever.  So I'm disappointed that I'm going to have to spend the time, money and effort to pick up replacement backs, but I expected this based on some of the other reviews.  So don't hesitate to buy these since they are great quality and a good value, but do plan to replace the backs before you wear them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Here is a great gift idea and a great value as well. For the price of just under $200, these are 14k yellow and white gold pieces that are stunning in style with a mirror-like finish that is a real eye-catcher. They are of a fair size  and look heavier than they are. They are well made and nicely presented in a gift box and a velvet pouch. They are stylish enough to be featured in a 5th Avenue window where they would probably sell for 2 - 3 times the price of admission here. Running out of time for your sweethearts holiday gift? Just pay a few more bucks for next day delivery and you are all set! I just don't see how you can go wrong with this fine set of earrings."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I really wanted an ALL Rose Gold look. And this company makes them in all gold and all silver with one side glossy and the other a satin look which would be my first choice, but so far they do not have it in all Rose Gold. I have shoulder length hair and they barely show. I might switch to a dangle shape instead. However they are truly beautiful and rich looking. If I had gobs of money I would definitely keep them! I have to decide....it's hard to know what to do. I have a ring wth rose gold and would like earrings of same color to match."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My goggles fit in the case, but it's a tight fit.  I wish the case were just a bit bigger (longer and deeper) to make it easier when putting the goggles in.  Once you wrestle with the goggles though and get them in, the case does it's job.  I've had these goggles in my gym bag for 6 months and they still look fantastic.  If TYR reads these reviews, it'd be nice if if you would put a second little zippered pocket on them where you could keep a small bottle of anti-fog solution.Speaking of anti-fog solution, don't forget to buy yourself a bottle of JAWS Quick Spit to keep your goggles from fogging up. Happy swimming!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I lost my beloved Danskin Women's Mosai-Ix Crop Pants somewhere, and since they've been discontinued I decided to try another Danskin style.I bought these leggings in my usual size medium, and found them to be way too tight.  The material was thin and shiny, and they gave me an unflattering look in the crotch.  I expected them to be fitted, but not like pantyhose.  Maybe a large would fit better, but I wasn't all that happy with the material either.  I'm going to return them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like the shoes, a lot.  The only issue I have is the top, instep is very snug.  It is making my foot sore.  I think it will loosen up a little, so for now I am only wearing the shoes part time.  I needed these to wear in the house, for some support while I am doing my normal house chores, so I just take them off for a bit, then go back to them later.  I hope they loosen up, I really like New Balance shoes, have been purchasing this brand for years."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I started wearing this type New Balance slide-on about 10 years ago during a bout of plantar fasciitis.  I was advised to a) wear only New Balance shoes and b) don't take even a single step barefoot.  For months I wore New Balance running shoes to work and I used these slip-ons as bedroom slippers.  Well, eventually my feet felt better and I could wear normal shoes to the office, but I have continued to wear these shoes as my slippers and house shoes and go-get-the-newspaper shoes.  Sometimes I also run errands in them.  They are versatile, comfortable, and supportive.  Because of the little lip at the heel your foot is held in the shoe so they don't slide off like a lot of clogs.  I love these shoes and wouldn't be without a pair."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these New Balance mules for around-the-house wear because they slip off easily when I need to go outside to work in the garden, however, they are so comfortable I find myself wearing them for shopping and other social activities as well.They are attractive--look great with jeans and cutoffs--and most important, my heel stays in the shoe. They run true to size. I wear a 9 medium and these in that size fit perfectly. I wish I had them in several colors. I may never go back to lace-up shoes again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "when I first bought it I was afraid he wouldn't like it, since it wasn't Iron man, or anything of that sort. But he was so excited that he made me write down the table chart for multiples of fives for the living room so he can reference it and find the time. The watch also is glow in the dark! which i didn't know. and its waterproof....he still hasn't taken it off. He said &#34;my daddy has a watch, and now I have a watch. Mine is better though because I have lizards.&#34;"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So, yes, I suppose I'm going through my second childhood...but, really, I had good reason to order this watch for kids!  (I'm 68)  First of all I like lizards.  But beside that fetish, I needed a watch that is COMFORTABLE to wear, easy to get on, won't overpower my skinny old wrist and that is inexpensive enough so that if I smash the thing doing barn chores, I won't feel any great loss.  This little cutie absolutely rates top notch on all counts.  I can't tell you how many people have complemented my choice...perhaps they're also waiting for me to wear my underwear on the outside of my clothes, too....but hey....if you can't be &#34;different&#34; you're just another old lady who rides horseback. And it keeps perfect time, too!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My four year old had just gotten a watch and then my three year old decided he needed to wear a watch also.  He loves animals! This was the best one I saw. It is a fabric wrist band so it was easy to size to his very small wrist. Band is too long for him but I tuck it under and it stays fine that way. Doesn't poke or itch him and now he wears it to school like his brother and shows his friends. Of course he can't tell time but oh well he feels like a big boy.  It lights up when you push in the button, which is the second thing he shows people after he announcing it has lizards on it.  Arrived quickly from seller :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "A mistake to buy for younger kids Igift for six year old) because so hard to make out the hands with moving lizards going round and round. an excellent design were it larger but it is smaller than expected - my fault as i didn't check the size. however it is sturdy and attractive, so i will wear it for myself at times - for fun. I didn't return as it was so inexpensive and just replaced it for intended gift, with a digital watch. haven't seen that yet."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These 501's were exactly what I was seeking for my son, though they can be purchased in W.A. the different washes are not available. I really wanted the 'Rigids' and they are not here. To find I could buy them on 'Amazon' but shipping outside of 'US' was not available, was really OFF!So many things in the last 4 months are not available for shipping outside the 'US'. It sometimes takes a long time to find everything and it's not until one checks out to discover the item-s are not available for shipping.What can I say."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is what happens when you move a quality product from the US to a foreign country for manufacture.  I've worn Levi's 501's since before they were even called 501's (over 60 years) and this product is not a Levi 501.  It is pure garbage and I've ordered my last pair.  It really is a bummer to see what is happening to so many \"American\" products that are shipped overseas to cheap labor manufacturers.  I would even advocate a boycott of Levi until they return to the quality that made them famous...Now I have to search for a replacement...Maybe I'll try Wranglers....."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just like always, if your from the west coast you know what I mean. Perfect fit as always but, the days of taking them home to wash and shrink them after purchase (shrink to fit) is still available But. the thick LEVI denim is a thing of the past. I remember back in late 60's, early 70's these pants would stand on there own when you would get them out of the washer they would chaff the hair off your legs all for $14.99, those days are gone. But with Global warming happening there a great pant and there priced right for the times."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "First, these jeans are quite comfortable. But.... I didn't read the description closely enough. When I hurriedly put them on preparing to leave the house for an appointment I was taken aback to discover that they had a button fly. I just went with them figuring that since I wore this type when I was a kid (before zippers were firmly established), I can deal with it. We'll see how that plays out. I do prefer ordering online since it is a 60 mile trek to go to the &#34;big city&#34; but sometimes being able to look closely before purchasing can be a good thing. Oh well......."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Well, these are definitely better than the 505's I bought a few months ago, but they're still not the Levi's jeans of a few years ago.  Compared to the 505's, these actually sit at the waist and are sized correctly.  The 501's also use a heavier denim than the 505's, 550's, etc.  The button fly was not my first choice, but this way I don't have to deal with the cheap zipper used in the current 505's.  Did I mention that Levi's are not the same quality product they were just a few short years ago?  The biggest difference between these 501's and the legacy 501's (and all other styles of Levi's jeans) is the missing belt loops.  There used to be 2 additional loops in the back, between the center loop and the 2 side loops.  Somehow they just don't feel right without those other 2 loops."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The traditional 501 has always been a favorite of mine.The jeans I received are identical to previous 501's except for one thing:The &#34;rise&#34;, the distance betwen the crotch and the upper edge of the pants, is smaller than it has always been, by about 1/2 inch. It may seem as a small difference, but I noticed it right away, and then confirmed by taking a tape measure to my old 501's and this one.This may not matter to some people, but it makes a difference to me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought a pair of 501's from Amazon and they feel a little lighter than my last two pairs I bought right off the shelf at SEARS almost a year ago. That's about it. I'm happy with my purchase. But! I usually buy 505's, but with the great variables in sizing I wont buy that style without trying them on first. Consistency is lost more or less, except with the 501's. The 501 style at least is going to fit the same way each time,no matter if they are made in Egypt or Mexico, Brazil or wherever they originate from. I always bought my jeans at Sears, but when you buy Levi 501's and see Egypt on the tags, well there's outsourcing and then there is outsourcing. Unbelievable, but get used to it. Its here to stay. Homemade will never be homemade ever again, at least for some products that is."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered these on the grounds that I needed a taller size. I loved the color, but they came up only midway up my buttcrack. When I did the 'crouch down' test they revealed much, much more. The legs and fit indicated they were not original fitting as the leg stayed the same width all the way down the leg. All in all, what I ordered was completely different from what I thought I was ordering. If you're a tall guy like me, don't get them.Other than that, I'm giving them two stars rather than one for nice quality and color."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like the color, but here again the inseam is about 2 inches too long (they are inconsistent). Here is the review i wrote for Lee:I am going to buy more Lee now than Levi's. I had never bought Lees until this holiday season. I now have several pairs and they are consistent (so far) in length and quality. i am 6 ft 3 and usually buy 34 x 34. With Levi's sometimes the inseam is slightly too short and other times it is almost 2 inches too long. I have many pairs of Levi's now that i must get hemmed. Plus their quality varies - maybe depending on where they are made. Some pairs seem more like Spandex than Denim. Nevertheless, sometimes i like the colors that Levi's offer so in the future i may buy them again. But mostly now Lees."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love 501 jeans, they fit just right in all the right places and I prefer button fly to zipper.  Note that the polished black is a bit different than the usual black jean (there is a plain black 501 as well).  The polished finish produces a shiny, more finished jean look which means that wrinkles are sharper and more noticeable -- the fabric is stiffer than the plain black jean.  If that happens, the tried and true technique of spraying the jeans lightly with water, wearing them or giving them a quick press will help.The stiffness of the fabric is part of the clean and neat appearance but unlike other 501s this also seems to reduce the &#34;give&#34; in the fabric and makes the fit tighter and slightly uncomfortable at first -- hoping this will work itself out after a few washes."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've worn 501s for a very long time and they seem to be getting harder to find.  Especially in my size.  It seems I'm shrinking back to my old waist size (yay!) so I ordered a couple pair at that size and a couple pair 2 inches fatter.  The fatter ones don't fit and it was easy to return them to amazon.  - NOTE: I made sure that amazon was the seller! -To sum it up, these were some new pants to replace some worn out ones.  Nothing exciting there other than it was really easy to click some buttons and get exactly what I was expecting.  Perfect."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm not going to educate anyone about the genuine and authentic timeless classic that is the Levi 501 Jean.Nor do I want to listen to the whining about them not being the same quality as they were 20 years ago. Maybe they aren't or maybe they are, but these are what's available today and they remain a stone cold classic blue jean.What I really like about ordering them on Amazon is the many choices of colors in the sizes I need at a more then fair price.  Can't be beat."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Levi's 501 jeans for literally half a century and the quality of the fabric has gone downhill to the point where a pair now lasts me less than a year before tears appear. I know that the stone wash type are actually tumbled with rocks and are not going to wear very long but I do expect the standard jeans to last a lot longer than a matter of weeks before having holes in the jeans from the fabric having worn thin. Dislike paying 10x as much and getting 1/10 the wear of the Levi's of the past."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very nice watch. I get complements on it all the time. I paid about ~69 with prime shipping and am very pleased.(Fulfilled by Amazon at the time.)The band is smooth, no hair pulling. Very sturdy. Titanium is a wonder metal. If you break this watch your arm is probably gone too. I'm pretty rough on watches and this one is holding up well.The band system is the best. Fully adjustable across the whole length and any excess stays put hidden beneath the other half and is not noticed by look or feel. Very secure latch that took me a bit to get used to but was mainly caused by tight tolerance in manufacture. Looser now from use and perfect.Slim sharp and tough. Very nice watch."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The watch is very attractive.  I do like the fact that it is so thin.  However, after receiving it I have found that I prefere a solid blue face as compared to this more modern style of the blue appearing differently depending on how the light happens to be hitting it.  This is personal taste, I just found that for me I don't particularly care for it.  It is a very beautiful watch and extremely light on the wrist, so even though I found I don't personally care for the style after receiving it I still gave it five stars.  I will be giving it to a friend for a holiday gift."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The watch I received did not have the word \"Titanium\" on the dial as shown, which led me to think that it was a fake. Returned and waiting for a refund. I'll be buying this watch again but from a different merchant. Do not purchase this particular Skagen model from Jomashop.Updates*: So I returned the watch and ordered another one, this time, from Watchstar. And guess what? It doesn't have the word \"Titanium\" on its dial either. I suspect that Amazon just sent me back what I had returned. I guess I'll just take the 30% off they offered for this faulty product."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The watch is really stylish. I wear it for casual-dressy ocassions and get compliments on it often.At the beginning I could not adjust the band (one size fits many) to fit my wrist and have it lock into place properly. Therefore I could not close the clasp when I put it on my wrist. I took it to a local jeweler to adjust properly (only charged $5). If you have difficulty also don't force it. Take it to a jeweler - you'll be happy you did.And then, the clasp mechanism itself is a bit complex - putting the watch on and taking it off is a bit tricky - it takes patience and some getting used to. After wearing it a dozen times I haven't quite mastered it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wanted a good looking mesh band watch with a slim head to fit under dress shirts or just be wrist candy that you can forget about. Perfect match!! The blue is brilliant and the face is simple which lets the simplicity speak for itself. Price is great for a slim titanium face of good quality (as opposed to something like a Movado). The clasp is easily adjustable. THE ONLY DRAW is that the joints where the band meet the face are stiff - meaning they don't flex to fit your wrist like most watches. This is only a problem if you have skinny wrists but even then its only a minor flaw. Great watch. Happy I got to add Skagen to my collection."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "You won't find a better watch for the money. I don't think there IS a better watch. This is the most comfortable, reliable, long-wearing, easily adjustable watch I have ever owned. I have a $900 Movado that I never wear because the clasp always comes loose. Besides, I'm so happy with my Titanium Skagen I never want to wear anything else. The Skagen mesh bands are the most comfortable thing in the world against your skin.My only negative remark is don't buy the black. I had that one before and the black coloring wore off where the band meets the watchface, and it looked shabby. This watch I have now is all Titanium, nothing to rub off."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Pros:  It's gorgeous.  Silver face and silver mesh band goes with anything.  Looks much more expensive than it is.  Beautiful, sparkly round diamond-like chips for the numbers.  Lays flat against the wrist - not bulky and very comfortable.  Easily adjustable band.  Keeps good time.Cons:  No deal-breakers here, just things you might want to know ~ Not waterproof so you can't wear it in the shower. I have long hair and every once in a while it will catch in the mesh band. And no date display, if that's important to you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This isn't my everyday watch,but it is the watch that I wear when I meet friends for lunch or go out for a day of shopping. I've owned it for over 3 years and like it a lot. The features I love is its low profile, silver tone mesh band, the relatively large numbers on its face, and the fact that I still have the original battery in it and it keeps good time. My only complaint is the latch that fastens it took a little time to get used to, but I got used to it quickly.This watch goes with everything because it is both sporty but also works in a more formal environment. I own a similar one in a gold finish that is used with gold jewelry.I've received a lot of compliments on this watch. People seem to like the fact that it is thin and compact looking."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This watch is more beautiful than the picture gives credit.  It is sleek and simple.  I love the mesh band, it is lightweigh and elegant looking.  The crystals on the watch face help me tell time in the dark.  The band was a little hard for me to figure out, but once I read the manual (duh!!!)it was simple to adjust the band and clasp the band. It does not say waterproof on the watch itself, but the description says it is in the manual and I have accidently worn it in the shower without a problem.  I would purchase this watch again, absolutely."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just received the watch recently and it's just gorgeous. Really very beautiful. I do wish it had a second hand but I knew it didn't when I bought it. Another reviewer mentioned that the closed clasp when you wear it doesn't form a circle around your wrist. It's true, it's kind of square-ish where the clasp is and at first it bothered me but it doesn't anymore. I can't see it unless I turn my wrist over and it doesn't feel weird or anything. Just a minor thing anyway. The watch is not too small, not too big and is thin and sleek. I get compliments on it. I love it!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased this watch about 3 weeks ago at a major chain membership store (for about forty bucks under retail).  I LOVE it.  The watch is very thin and does not get caught on sleeves or other clothing.  I have received about ten compliments on it in the short time I have owned it.  The face of the watch is a \"brushed stainless\" look and the band is both brushed and polished steel.  The dial markers are tiny tiny crystals (but do not look tacky in the slightest).  This is a very simple design for people who like the basics.  The watch has a very nice quality and I think will hold up for a long time.  The only thing I wish it had was a date indicator-but overall, this watch is a beautiful piece."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just as beautiful as the photo, and provides great support! I did take the advice of other reviewers, and bought a size down (normally a 34C, and I bought a 32C). It fit great in that sense. However, I am a bit on the petite side (5' 2\") and the bottom of the torsolette kind of juts out--wouldn't look good under my wedding gown. I am returning it, but do recommend it if you have a slightly longer torso. I wish they made a petite size!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Love, love, love this cosmetic bag! I can't say enough positive things about this bag. It works perfect for my needs. I have always found it frustrating digging through bags trying to find the bottle I need. This solves that problem being able to where everything is at a glance. The smaller pockets at the top fit things like band-aids, chap stick, and nail clippers while the middle sized ones are the perfect size for travel sized sample bottles. The larger pockets at the bottom are perfect for several larger 12 oz bottles such as sunblock and hairspray. The bag then folds in half to lay flat fitting perfect in a carry on."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The item is not as pictured.  I just looked at the picture again.  The bottom plastic case are big enough to hold powder in the picture.  It is only big enough to hold small items.Also it has a horrible smell something like burning plastic.  I have aired it out while waiting for the seller to respond to me and it is still as bad.  Another review mentioned it.I found the seller's responses insulting.  I would never buy them from them again.All in All I find 99% of my purchases from Amazon are great.  I am a dedicated Amazon buyer and if I was Amazon I would removethis seller as they bring down the quality of Amazon's image."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased these shoes for my husband who was opposed to wearing them initially.  After some coaxing, he raved about the comfort and is a Sperry convert.  Unfortunately, after wearing less than a week, they began to fall apart.  I returned them and ordered a new pair which were a size larger than they should have been despite being marked a 9.5.  Sooo, I returned them again.  This time, we'll buy in person as Amazon cannot be trusted to deliver a quality product that is sized correctly."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These fit well; are comfortable and look great. My husband is wearing them around the house for major projects! Not the exact intent for a pair of sandals. He just built a fenced in chain link fence in the back yard wearing these! He is also doing concrete work with these on! Silly, I know but that is him: he grabs whatever pair of shoes and cares not what they are when he is working So they have dust and dirt on them but the soles are so heavy duty that he is wearing them for these tasks! Got a great deal on them. I am sure they will clean up well. He is very hard on shoes; apparently you can use these for remodeling projects they are so heavy duty! Would buy him these again!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn Keen sandals in the past and the first pair I owned was for hiking and kayaking in the Western States.  They are very durable and comfortable in most every situation.  I purchased this pair to have a \"dress\" pair of sandals that could be worn to outdoor get togethers in the heat of the summer.  The lining for your foot is very comfortable and the leather and construction seem to be top notch.  You spend more for these on the front end but will have years of enjoyment in wearing them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I do a lot of field work across the world and have heard nothing but good things about these sandles - however for me, I can't even wear them. After 1 month, they just stank. Now, I don't have particularly smelly feet. And can't smell any other shoes, but these are bad. Others people with the same shoes tell me that as well (although they still like them). And I found them fairly uncomfortable. I remember that Teva's sandles, when they first came out, also smelled, and then they made them different. Oh, well."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are the original high quality Keen Sandals. Heavy gauge sole, strong construction, compressible foot bed for comfort. After being to the store yesterday where they have a display of new Keen sandals I was appalled at how poorly constructed the new version is...the plastic is akin to the stuff they use on flip flops, the upper construction enters the shoe a full 1/4 from the edge, overall a cheap shadow of these shoes. Hopefully Keen will not go the way of so many other shoe companies and cheapen their shoes to the point of undesirability. You may want to consider an extra pair if you hope to find them again in the future."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These Smartwool trekking socks are great for everyday winter wear in the cold weather.  I wear them around the house and they keep my feet warm and if I need to throw on some boots and take my dog for a walk or run out, they keep my feet warm in the outdoor weather.  They are cushioned but not so much that you can't wear them with regular sneakers.  Smartwool socks are the best I have found for winter socks to keep my feet warm.  My only recommendation is to make sure you get the right sized socks because if they are too tight, even a little too tight, it will reduce circulation which creates cold feet.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a warm winter sock."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was delighted when it first arrived:  very silky, lightweight, long in the waist for tucking in, and a bit of a dip at the neck so it doesn't show above sweaters.  However, after washing it on delicate in lukewarm water and laying it out flat on a towel to dry, I was surprised to see how much it had shrunk in length...3 inches!  Luckily it still fits into my slacks, but not by much.  And the delicate pattern in the silk has condensed a bit, so it is not as silky as it was before.  Also, wearing it under a cashmere sweater does not protect me from feeling the slight itchiness of the wool on my skin.  Not sure if I would buy again, although I did feel warmer with it on, and the arm length is perfect.  I am a size 8 and I bought a small after having read the other reviews."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this undershirt. I bought one (along with the leggins) last winter to wear under my XC ski clothing. Next I took it on a 5wk walk across Spain this spring. Although I didn't need to wear it much on the walk I lent it to several of my friends who were walking with me and who needed a little extra warmth! My sister was one and I promised her one for her birthday! I found it quite roomy and could have probably bought a medium for myself....hence I bought the medium for my sister. It can be squished into a ziplock bag taking no space in your pack. It is warm and washes and dries quickly overnight. All in all a very useful item for travelling!Jenn, BC"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This product has made me very happy, although at first impressions, it looks too thin and sheer to be true. I replaced all my merino long johns with this as I developed an allergy from wearing too much merino too frequently, and now I can't touch them at all. Anyway, this brand is great, and I have also bought the equivalent tops as my base layer as well, they are warm and really light. My husband has heaps of these too and he really likes the range (long johns, long sleeve and short sleeve silk base layers). As the fabric is delicate, a little care during washing would be good. Otherwise, it washes well and dries very quickly unlike wool products."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I almost returned these shoes, they're very light weight, almost too lightweight. It is only The hemp, no lining, no anything. The soles dont provide very good traction on wet/smooth surfaces. They 10 was a little big.BUTThey are very comfortable and look super cute with jeans. For running around on a nice day or walking around the city, they're pretty good.I don't hate them enough to return them, but don't love them enough to wear them all the time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I feel similarly about this item as I do about Communism: Seems good in theory, but in reality, it falls apart (quite literally)! I was very excited about this item, ordered it, and it arrived with the hinges already broken, w/the screws fallen out. Then, because I thought it was just a fluke, I ordered ANOTHER one, and the exact same thing happened, only this time, half of the back side of the lid (near the screws go) was totally split. So basically, all this item did for me was cause me a bunch of time and trouble to return. It's tempting, but my advice is find something else- stay away from this!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This watch has everything I was looking for.  It is clear and concise, has day/date feature and Indaglo so I can see it in the dark.  I travel a lot and don't have to turn on the light at night.  I have a collector watch I am retiring and have a band I wanted to transfer to the new one.  Fine.  I read a complaint from someone regarding setting the day.  To do this you wind the watch backwards and the day will change correctly.  Otherwise, you will mess everything up."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very nice Timex watch with comfortable expansion band which is a little tight for my small wrist(7 inch) but not too tight and is easy to remove and put back on. The best thing I like is the easy to read dial and the indiglo light to read in dark. Just push stem button in and lights up nicely in dark.It looks like the band is gold plated though it does not mention. As for the day and month setting,I just can not get the stem in right position for that feature,I am not interested in the month and day setting,but would be nice if easier to use.I like the 10 year battery as the instructions state,I remember not too long ago having to get new battery about once a year.Another good watch at a good price that looks more expensive than it cost from Timex. I do recommend this Timex watch with the minor points I mentioned.A very readable timepiece to tell the time with and that's what counts."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "even if you are not, buy this watch.  I am a nurse, much like many of the other reviewers.  In fact, I bought it due to their reviews.  It is a fantastic watch.  Easy to read, has an illumination option and a handy date feature.  The only trouble I have is the size of the band (too long).  I will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out, however, the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy (it's not).  Don't even bother looking for another watch, this one is a steal."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Okay, the strap is black but the dial itself is brown. It's very cute! great for simple outfits and it even has the date. The light up mechanism itself, is a button on the side that you pressed. I thought it would be the numbers itself so when I'm groggy in the middle of the night, I can just half-open my one eye, and I will be able to tell the time, but no, I have to push the button. Maybe I'm spoiled by technologies, but it's not hard to just make it glow, right? ah, what do i know."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The watch is very small. The face is about the size of a quarter, and the band is thinner than a half an inch. Some people say they can't see the date displayed on the watch, but I think those people might need to get their eyes checked. The date display is small, but plenty big enough to see if you have the right glasses prescription. Some people say the glowing wasn't bright enough, but I think it's great. I hate when it glows too bright to the point where it looks like you're trying to take down an aircraft with your watch. You can't see it glowing if you're in broad daylight."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The picture of the watch makes it look big with a very wide band. I was hesitant to order it because I thought it wouldn't look like a women's watch.When it arrived I was pleased to see that the band is less than an inch wide at the largest end. The watch is a beauty in that the numbers have bright (very small) silver arrows that point to the numbers. I like this feature because it only takes a quick glance to read the time. The face is fairly easy to read but really shines when Indiglow button is pushed the face then becomes a pretty shade of aqua and is a fairly bright light.While this a &#34;casual&#34; wear watch I like the fact that the matte black surround doesn't clash with rings and wrist jewelry.It light-weight and comfortable. I would buy this again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like the look of this watch very much, but 3 problems:  1) the band is relatively short, and 2) the straps to hold the band down (2) disintegrated after about 2 months, and 3) while the watch is waterproof, using it while swimming fewer than 6 times has resulted a faded and worn looking watch band. I'd buy it again if the band could be longer and there could be a more durable or perhaps a metal bracket to hold down the end of the band."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was ordering a wrist watch for my nephew and somehow, this product popped up.  As it looked similar to the watch that I was about to place in my shopping cart, I placed this one in the shopping cart, and did not pay attention to what I was buying.  When I received it, I contacted Amazon and received an immediate return authorization label.  I sent it back on Monday December 16, 2013 and have received my refund credit already on Tuesday December 17, 2013.  Great product.....just clicked on the wrong one."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Great Watch... I am on my 2nd one. My first watch is still working and keeping excellent time on my friends ATV handle bars. lol  I replaced the Band twice and bought a new one simply cause it started to not look so nice. It took the licking and kept on ticking for years with the original battery. Just too banged up to be presentable. So before the 3rd band wore out, and the battery failed... I decided to just buy a new one here. In a nutshell, Great watch... Easy to use... and a great price on Amazon.Mark from CANADA!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I work 3rd shift outside year round so I need a watch that can and will stand up to abuse. For starters the velcro band is very comfortable and sturdy. The watch is so light that you will forget you're wearing it. The display is fairly large and easy to read. Not to mention that the greenish background makes it easy to read even in sunlight.  The only  thing I'm not enjoying anout the watch is the plastic case, but hey if anything happens I won't be upset like I would if it were my Citizen...Anyway buy this watch, you won't regret it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm wearing this watch right now and I can say this is the best watch I have ever owned. It may not be fancy, but it is durable and functional. I've had it for 6 months and as a fishing guide in Yellowstone National Park, it has held up to everything mother nature could possibly throw at it. Snow, rain, sleet, days of hot sun, and up to 100 feet of water. I am also a diver and when it says water resistant to 100 meters, it means it. This is now my go-to diving watch because the buttons are so easy to push, even with bulky gloves on.The band is surprisingly durable and the velcro snaps together like the day I got it.The only negative is that the face scratches pretty easily, but even with the scratches the time and numbers are extremely legible.If this watch ever does give out, I will 100% buy another."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a really good looking ladies watch, plus it has my favorite feature of pushing the stem and having the watch face light up.  This is especially great during a boring movie, play, opera, etc., to tell you how much time you have left before you can get out.  Or going on a trip and waking up in the middle of the night and being able to see the time.  The gold finish with the pearlized face gives it a nice, expensive look.  The band is nice, but I'd like to see a grosgrain band for a dressier look.  All over, This watach gets an A+ from me, because of the price and the great look combined."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This gets use year round, not just in the winter.  In the winter, my wife and me both use it.  She gets to put on nice warm shoes and socks, and I get to put on nice dry shoes and socks.  I don't have a problem staying warm outside in the winter, even when temperatures reach -40.  My problem is sweat.  Shoes can only be washed so often, but it is nice to not have my shoes smell like they are rotting.  This does not get hot enough to cause any damage.  If you forget to turn it off and leave it on all day and night, you aren't going to burn your house down or triple your electric bill.  I might get another one for guests at the house."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Bought for my son for his work boots and gloves.  It dried his boots overnight.  There is no fan, so no noise, and he just put it in his bedroom using the floor mounts.  We had another boot drier with a fan that we used in the garage but this design is much better.  You would think this would do nothing because you can touch the prongs when it is on and it barely feels warm.  When I put my hand up inside when the boot was mounted on one of them though it was much warmer, but still not overly hot.  Pretty neat how it works."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have the double front cargo pants from carhartt and these are quite a bit longer, which is good for me, because I am 6'8&#34; and finding something that fits like these is not easy.  I just got these so I have not had a chance to verify the durability, but I can say that they are water resistant.  These are probably the best standard work pants for wet weather and resisting stains.  But I like how they are cut and the fit is ideal for wearing layers underneath but wearing them alone is fine as well. carhartt makes very practical work clothing and they tend to know what they are doing."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been wearing Carhartt for several years. I usually buy them at my local store but the Amazon price is $10 less and my local store would not match. The last 5 pairs of these pants I have purchased, including this pair have all been very bad on size consistency. I have worn the same size for years and up until recently there was little to no variation. But this last year or so has been pretty bad. I have seen variation's of at least an inch in inseam & waist. For me that is the difference of pants dragging on the ground or practically falling off my waist! I'm not sure what is going on in the quality control department, but I'm going to be trying the Duluth Fire hose pants now to see if they are more consistent. My co-worker swears by them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've had this watch for several months now and I really like it. The second hand is nice for timing things, and it is very easy to read the time. It's also very simple so it doesn't compete with other jewelery. However, as other reviews stated, this watch is VERY small. My writs are almost exactly 6 inches around and I wear this watch on the third-largest size, so it definitely wouldn't go more than ~6.5 inches around your wrist. Other than that, it's very nice, delicate, and simple."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Purchased this sleek looking watch for my wife.  She is hard on watches and I didnt want a $1500 Omega that would be scratched and destroyed a year later.  This watch exudes classic femininity and looks stylish in work, play or sporting environments.  Very reasonable cost with the only downside that it is water resistant but not water proof.  It can probably withstand a shower but obviously not diving in the ocean.  My wife received it and enjoys it, so happy all around.  Would buy another one a few years down the road, when the current one gives out.  Nice buy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I haven't bought a Timex in years,so I didn't know what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box.  As you may expect from the price, it's not a fancy watch, but it's the perfect watch if you are looking for a simple and inexpensive watch.  I wear mine every day to work and it's quality is what you expect from Timex.  The strap is skinny which is perfect for my small (6 1/2 inch) wrists.  I did not even have to have holes added.  The face is oval and gold tone. If you are looking for a cute watch with a small face this is a watch you should consider.  At it's price, I would definitely buy another if it came is silver tone."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I looked for a long time for a 'starter' watch for my daughter.  I thought this was the best of what I could find.  First the pros:  the numbers are large, the second hand is a butterfly, and it lights up.  Cons:  the wrist band is adjustable which really means that it is never tight enough and slides around a lot.  I was hoping she would want to wear it every day, but she really doesn't like that it's not secure on her wrist."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These watches are wonderful for children learning the nuance of time.  There are small numbers at the edges reminding them that if the big hand is at 10, it is 50 minutes after the hour, etc.  They are comfortable, and inexpensive enough that the kids can wear them to school without worry.  They are NOT water proof, so need to be taken off before showering or swimming, but can endure almost all other activities.  My granddaughters wear theirs always and I believe it helped them to learn time quickly and painlessly.  The batteries are long lasting.  They come in a wide variety of patterns and colors for both girls and boys.  You really can't go wrong with these watches."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Keen is one of the main brands of shoes that I wear this is my 4th pair these are great for beaches, hanging out or just casual walking but not for trailing.Pros: They are comfortable I don't have any problem at all with the fit and they are supportive at least for my feet. slipping them on and off is pretty easy for me so that's not a problem. Love that color combo! They protect my toes well as most Keens do. They have nice treads.Cons: THEY GET STINKY! I don't usually have problems with foot odor at all, but an attempt at bicycling, or long hikes in these and EWWWWW!  I find myself washing them frequently to avoid the odor."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like these a lot.  They are comfortable and very sturdy.  I have trouble with pronation, especially in my right foot.  These keep me walking more like I should be, almost like having linear platform built into them.  My ONLY complaint is that they run a little small.  I don't mind paying extra for good shoes like this, but I wish they were more true to size. UPDATE:  I wore these all summer long, and it didn't take long before these fit my foot really well, and were my go-to shoes most every day, leaving my 50+ other pairs of shoes in the dark closet!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am so glad that i listened to the reviewers.  I am a true size 10 in all my shoes but ordered a half size larger for these and i am so glad i did that!  These fit perfect!!  I wore them last evening on a bicycle night ride and it was muddy and wet - i showered with these shoes on to clean them off and they are as good as new!!  I want to wear flip flops while biking but that's unsafe so i found these are even more comfortable because they give support , let air in for coolness and have toe protection too - plus they look really sporty!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I actually bought these from another site because of a 20% coupon code and free shipping,  although I did have to wait longer.....but anyways....Might I say this blue color is fabulous and uber cute! !!My feet are slightly wide. .. not wide enough for wide shoes,  but sometimes look puffy in mediums.  Mt size is a 9.I would say the 9.5 is perfect fit.  Not too snug,  even after walking 2 miles and my feet swell a bit,  they were not too snug and still felt good. Plenty of toe room too.The bottoms are a little more plasticy feeling,so to speak, than I expected but still comfortable.As a woman who has made the decision comfort is a priority but I still want a little cute,  I'm really happy with this purchase, perfect for the chic hippie,  lolBottom line. ..I world suggest 1/2 size larger and they are fine for a slightly wider foot.Happy Shopping :-)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a shoe for travel, I read other reviews and decided it was what I needed for a visit to Easter Island.Sand, water, rocks, hiking, slick rocks and such, heat, comfort.  Wow these are just great for everything and my feet are happy at the end of the day.  Remember to put suntan lotion you the tops of your feet as mine are now look like a checker board from the sun.  I took them on to Thailand and even in the city they were great.  You can't go wrong with these sandals."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I read the reviews of Venice Hs and the Whisper series.  Even comparing the styles by picture, this appears sturdier altho clunkier looking...and it is so in person. HOWEVER,  This is meant to be an active outdoor shoe and for that purpose I love this more thanmy old open toed active sandal of a different famous brand.  I love the toe protection. I love that you can have the option of this light gray in certain colors rather than the black. It' lets air thro nicely ( It's a 4 because some small pepples that come in are hard to shake of without removing the shoe) and I love this green but it is more pastel than I had wanted...It's comfortable and easy to slip on and off. i use it to walk the dog daily even after a rain. I also got it at a much cheaper price ( almost $40.00 lower) because I bought it early spring.  The prices rose thereafter.  Thanks Keen for a great product."}

{"label": 8, "raw": "These jackets are great for work or leisure if you're into the outdoors. They run kind of big so I'd suggest getting a size smaller than you usually wear or getting the size you usually wear and then shrinking it with a warm (not hot) cycle in the washking machine or dryer. Some Carhartt jackets can be washed on hot, but depending on the material, a cycle on hot could ruin or damage material Carhartt uses in the production of some of their other jackets. I usually wear a large and I ordered this jacket in a large, and while it didn't fit like an XL, it was a bit too large. I washed it in warm water and dried in the machine and now it fits great. Loose, but tight enough to not look baggy or feel uncomfortably big. These jackets last, and they're great for light weight weather resistence or layering. I'd recommend this jacket to anyone as long as they keep in mind the sizing specifications."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "When i got this jacket i assumed that its for really cold weather because of the thermal lining.Its what i consider a 40 deg jacket maybe even lower if you layer something underneath.If you are looking for one that can handle colder temp i would suggest a quilted or parka lined Carhartt jacket.I have owned this for about 1 1/2 years now and it still look as it did when i bought it.I didnt give it 5 stars mainly because the zipper can be a PITA at times and the thermal lining is thin and not comfortable if you are wearing a short sleeve t-shirt."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband's favorite winter jacket finally wore out.  He was heartbroken.  Naturally, I went to Amazon to find him a new one.  Looked at many, many jackets and read reviews.  Finding this Carhartt Jacket, reading the reviews, I ordered it.  I told him about it and he just knew he wasn't going to like it, it wasn't going to fit - blah blah blah.  Well, it arrived just in time for the severe below zero weather.  This jacket is everything it claims to be - keeps him warm in below freezing weather, looks sharp, has the inside pockets which are a must for my husband.  He's 6'1 and 250 lbs. and most things I buy for him are XXL.  Went with XL on this jacket because it's a Tall and it fit him perfectly!  Highly recommend."}

Wash them a few times before wearing to lessen the &#34;swish&#34; sound they make as you walk and loosen them up a bit.Like the header says, standard. These pants are pants. You get 2 front pockets and 2 back packets that will fit keys, a wallet, a lighter. Hook snap at waist and zipper fly.  Color. I never iron them. Standard wash and dry. If I leave them in the drier too long they come out wrinkled and I just hang them for a day and they come out fine.I bought these to replace 2 other pairs I have in rotation that I have worn at the office for 3 years now.Belt loops are a tad tight for thicker leather belt."}

I've worn them three times now and they look as good as they did when I put them on the first time.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that they ARE NOT made to stand up on their own, like the picture would have you believe. There is nothing sewn into the stocking to help it stay up either, so it's not that they just don't stay up.  They are made to be worn with a garter, so it would have been helpful if they had presented them that way, instead of using the picture they did.  I think that's why the model is holding her legs together...to keep the stockings up for the half second it took to take the picture. ;)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Very comfortable as a nursing bra. I dont sleep in mine, but it was important for me to have a supportive bra that was not too tight and did not have underwires that would effect my milk supply. Based on the size of my breasts throughout the day, I can hook or unhook as many eyelets as i need to to be comfortable. I like that it is front hooking so that I can easily access my breasts to feed my son. The only drawback is that the seam comes up a bit high and can be uncomfortable on my nipples sometimes when they are sensitive after nursing. But for the price you cannot beat the comfort and function of this bra. i wish there was a hyrid version of this and the Simple Wishes Hands free pumping bra."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am a relatively small woman with naturally large breasts.  As such I have never been able to wear a bra without an underwire.  However, when I got pregnant and found my once comfortable C cups very full Ds, it became painful to sleep without a bra.  I purchased this bra with the hopes to find relief while I slept from both the breast tenderness and the soreness associated with the underwire bras I was used to.  It was heaven sent!  I couldn't believe something as soft and gentle as a t-shirt could provide just the right amount of support to keep me contained but comfortable.  I had to come back and order more!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been looking for something comfortable to wear around the house and I've found it. I just had a baby a few months ago and I'm huge (42C). This fits perfectly. It's not too tight and not too lose and it provides some support. Not as much as my underwire, but around the house, it's great. I forget I have it on and the hooks in the front don't bother at all.It also keeps you separated... no uni-boob, which is awesome.All in all a good investment."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this primarily to wear when I'm kinda dressed, but not leaving the house; it's so comfortable that I've slept in it, and woken up none the worse for wear. I'm a 38D, and I can't say this offers the kind of support I prefer for outside wear. However, it looks very nice, and gives very good support and excellent separation; it's perfect for wearing when I can't be bothered with an underwire. I also love the front closure. It's really easy to close and doesn't chafe at all while I'm wearing the bra.In short, this is the first \"leisure bra\" I've ever worn that doesn't leave me with a single sagging mono-bazoom. It's not cheap, but I'm going to get another one, because this ratio of comfort to support is hard to come by."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Got it for those &#34;hang around the house in a sweatshirt&#34; days.  For the most part it's quite comfortable.  The band is a little snug-feeling by the end of the day - but that's why I opted for a front closure (and can reasonably unhook the bottom 1 or 2 hooks).Hopefully some ladies agree with me:  the bra I put on in the morning (comfy) is not the one I take off at night (band is too snug).  This bra is as close as it comes to being the best answer to that problem.  I look the array of colors it came in too."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered the same bra size I normally wear, and the band is very tight. The shoulder straps (which are not adjustable) were also tight. I've lost some weight since purchasing the bra, and it's still tight but wearable. Previously, I couldn't bear to wear it at all. I'm hoping the elastic will loosen up a bit with time.I can easily see why this bra doesn't work for all ladies. I'm petite and fine-boned, and the shoulder straps are just barely big enough for me (and that's taking into account the weight I lost!). The fabric is wonderfully soft and stretchy, but if you can't find the right size it simply will not work for you. There isn't a lot of leeway because nothing is adjustable.In conclusion, I suggest selecting at least one band size up from normal, and making sure to order from a vendor with a good return policy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My surgeon recommended that I wear sports bras 24/7 after surgery. I tried a number of bras pre-surgery, but this one and one by AMOENA were by far the best fitting and most comfortable. I'm wearing them 2 at a time for better support, and have been comfortable enough to order two more to keep me going while the others are in the laundry. The fit is a bit on the large size, mostly because the bra is stretchy. However, that stretchiness came in really handy for keeping ice packs in place the first few days. The front hooks have made getting into and out of this bra easy enough for me to manage without help. All in all, I've been very happy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Absolutely gorgeous! A perfect replacement for those nylon and spandex, unlined bras Calvin Klein used to make, that made the breasts look completely natural and not \"packaged\" like they do with \"contour cups.\" Unfortunately, the band and cups do run small. A 38DD fit like a 36C. In fact, this is the second Wacoal Bra I've tried that ran small (see my review ofWacoal Women's Halo Lace Full Coverage Underwire Bra # 65547). I'd buy three if the size went up to 40D!! But alas, 99.9% of racerback and racerback-like (close-set straps) bras stop at 38D or DD. If you're a smaller chested woman, this bra is THE CURE to all those ridiculous euphemisms for padded bras: \"molded cups,\" \"T-shirt bra,\" age-defying lift\" and my favorite, \"seamless.\" Thank you very much, but simple nylon over my own breast is actually seamless!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a wonderful style bra. I have worn them for years and they do eventually wear out and I order another drawerful.I even sleep in one. They 're that comfortable. I have a size 32 frame but need the D cup ( and this is a very difficult size to locate. I can rarely find them in stores any more.)  So Amazon saves the day for me again! It is so supportive that you could wear it any time from dressing up or to wear under your gym outfits. However, if I was going to be running, a compression bra might be a better choice...I started wearing this style front hook when I had had a hand surgery and couldn't use a back hook ...and never went back to it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I originally bought one of these bras in a department store when they didn't have any nursing bras my size, and I purchased an additional one from Amazon later.  The salesperson said she wore this bra all the time while her baby was breastfeeding!  The salesperson helped me find the correct size so that the underwires do not pinch my breast tissue, which can lead to clogged ducts.  I actually only pump since my baby never learned to breastfeed, but it's very easy to unsnap the front to pump.  The stretchy cups accomodate size changes throughout the day from breastfeeding, and the underwires make it so much more flattering than the wire free bras I've tried.  My only complaint is that the cups are very thin, so I need to wear nursing pads to prevent \"headlights\" -- for this reason, I will not wear these bras once I'm done breastfeeding and will go back to a padded or molded cup style."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra looks very nice; I got both the black and the toast. Issue here is I wonder how long they will hold up. They have a type of 't-shirt material' feel; and aren't the sturdiest. For the price, I was expecting much higher quality. Time will tell if they hold up or fall apart! Not impressed with the quality but they are comfortable. Not sure if I recommend; due to my conflicting thoughts on them. I do think you can get a better quality bra for a lower price here on Amazon..."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear Wacoal all the time and the band size on this definitely runs small (I'd say by one size; I'm normally 34D, but could have used a 36 in this; I think the sizing issue is because the band isn't adjustable and they decided to err on the side of too snug). The lift is nice, and the straps sit in the middle of the shoulder as pictured instead of riding to the center like so many t-backs. The fabric is quite thin so don't expect any, er, cold-weather protection. I do recommend it, just know what you're getting."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The more I wear it, the more I love it.  It's so comfortable.  I'm not constantly messing with the straps and tugging on it because I'm about to fall out of it.  This bra fits really well.  The minute I put it on, I can stop thinking about it for the rest of the day.  The straps stay put and don't dig in to my shoulders.  Plus, I love not having to worry about the straps showing.  Fits true to size and fits well.  Good support.  Have all three colors now.  :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Although I love the look of the bra, and the size seems fine, I was hoping for something more comfortable. Unfortunately, it seems that when I purchase good looking, somewhat supportive bras, I find them uncomfortable, and after just a short period of time, can't wait to take them off. The comfortable ones may lack style and support but they do offer comfort. If only someone could design the perfect match. Also, this one does show back fat and I was hoping for a sleeker look. I'm a 38D so, unfortunately, in professional settings, I do need to wear a bra with a bit of support. Just haven't found the perfect one yet."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So many guys wear panty's and not even their wives know. My wife started me in panty's years ago and this is all I wear. These are by far the most comfortable panty's you can buy and I have a lot of different ones myself. I have no problem changing In dressing rooms at the pool or gym wearing these panty's. I don't hide that I wear panty's. I have even changed in locker rooms wearing lace and even ruffles. Guys if your sick of cotton like I was these are the ones to try. Everything about this panty is great and before long you will be in panty's forever."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was very excited to order these panties. Tried them on and was instantatly amazed. A sexy, string bikini is very hard to find,especially one as comfortable as this tactel string bikini. Not only are they nice looking, but this material is very heavenly. Love the feel on my skin. i have a 36 waist usually take a 6 in most panties and these were very nice. My my most recent purchases however, have been size 5 and with the stretch of this of this panty i'll only buy a 5 in the future. Now have every color. These are simply awesome to wear! i wear panties 24/7 now and love it. These are my favorites withou a doubt. men, do your selves a favor and check them out."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm giving these 2 stars because they are comfortable and basically the best pair of \"drawers\" lol I've ever purchased.HOWEVER they lied! You can clearly see your panty line so don't wear any  form fitting clothes with these!!I wore a high low maxi dress with Jockey Skimmies Slipshorts underneath so that's two articles of clothing on top and as clear as day I was able to see my panty outline!Another time I wore a pair of  light color jeggings and not only did the panty line show but the middle seam and the design on them did too!!very embarrassing!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These liners do fit rather snuggly, hugging my very curve and bump. The waist band is about an inch or so above my navel, and the lower hem ends a couple of inches above my knee. There is, indeed, no tag, and I see no laundering instructions, so I am going to wash them medium (permanent press), and dry on low. I don't think they will shrink much with just 43% cotton, but with 14% lycra, I don't want to wash and dry them too hot or roughly. They will make good liners under shorts to work out, or even under other clothing for \"curve contol\".  Not bad for about $14.  There are not terribly thin, but too thin to wear alone. I would like to see them available in more colors than just the Birch (light gray)."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this bra because it had so many good reviews and I am always looking for a minimizer bra.  I bought my regular size which is a 34C.  I have to wear it in the loosest hook and I usually wear a 34C in the tightest hook.  I put it on this morning and it felt a little snug but not uncomfortable and I thought it would be OK.  Now it's after lunch and I am sitting at my desk after eating a Chick-Fil-A sandwich -- just the sandwich mind you -- not the meal.  Well I am about to die. This bra is cutting me in half and there's nothing I can do about it.  I can't just take it off and go around braless so I am hostage to this torture chamber!  I'm too lazy to send it back so I'll just wear it on a &#34;thin&#34; day."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased a different color of this bra at a store and loved it so much that I came on here to find more of it.  I was excited to see that it cost a lot less on Amazon than it did in the store.  I ordered the same size I had already been wearing in the same bra, I just got a different color.  The black one I ordered, the fabric/lace is much stiffer and it's uncomfortable.  And for some reason it is bigger than the first one I got in the store...in band size and cup size.  The underwire goes up into my armpit further as well, making it uncomfortable that way as well.  I wonder why there is such a difference between the one I purchased in a store and the one I ordered from Amazon.  So bummed :("}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this bra over two years ago on a whim from a different website, and I almost wore it out to the point where the hooks on the back started coming apart. Its lacy so I wasn't expecting much comfort, but I literally wore it day and night PLUS my girls arent as &#34;perky&#34; as they were after my first baby so they give excellent support, are true to size, and comfortable enough. They also dont show through any cute shirt you might want to wear."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I received this bra 2 days ahead of the scheduled delivery date. Great job Amazon. The material is is A-One quality. Nice wide straps, the thin lace cups leave just enough transparency to get the imagination in overdrive. lol. The underwires are just right and make for a well fitted bra holding everything in place as it should. Only regret is that the cup size seemed a little larger than I had expected.  Probably should have ordered a B cup? But with my breast enhancers inserted I can fill it out for a nice fit.  This is certainly a sexy appearing and very comfortable bra and deserves the high ratings given by most of the other reviewers."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Tried these on over my panties, and it was a perfect fit.  Ran them through the wash, and they came out AT LEAST a full size smaller.  The shrinkage of the fabric was so bad that the elastic is actually bunched up now at the openings.  The leg openings are tight now, the height of the panty from crotch to belly is so much shorter, the rear area isn't fully covered. I can't wear them, and i can't send them back now.  Vanity Fair is disappointing me after many years of satisfaction.I can't say these are even worth trying.  Keep looking."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I recently purchased these panties based on the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality, price and fit. Being a male I was looking for a panty that appeared more to be a unisex style. The panties fit very well and are so much more comfortable than my old male underwear with the fly. The cotton in these panties is softer and more condensed. I have now thrown most of my old underwear out and will continue buying these panties as replacements. The wide gusset and the elastic leg bands make for a perfect fit for a male. I would highly recommend these panties to anyone, male or female."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm 44DD so I wear bras all the time.  This one is effective,  in that it lifts, and it gives good posture because if you slouch the wires stick out in the front - very unattractive,  so I find myself sitting straight.  It's comfortable but seriously not sexy, and comes up very high. It wears comfortably under my gym gear and I bought it for a gym bra but it's not very versatile,  as it shows under most of my other tops (and they're not particularly low cut)Edited to add,  it wasn't flexible enough to be comfortable in exercise class and I've just thrown it out.  Didn't work at all for me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "As suggested by other people, this bra DOES run small in the number and a bit more spacious in the cup size than the average bra. If you like your bras on one of the inner hooks, measure your ribs where your bra sits and add 4 to the number - if you only add 2 you will be wearing it on the outermost set of hooks.I'm a 40H - I ordered a 42G and it fits very well - though I prefer to have at least 1 extra set of hooks that are looser than what I use just in case.Would I order it again? Yes.Would I probably pick a 44G instead of a 42G having tried this bra? Unless I lose some weight in the near future, yes."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have a hard time finding a bra in my size, it works fine around but the cups are usally too large and bag out as is the case here.  I know a good bra fit can be done because I've had bra's in the past that fit very well.  Somehow things are not being manufactured as they once were and this bra ended up as were others - in my donation bin.  Too bad really, wasted my money and am continuing to have no choice but to wear the old bra's."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was sorta skeptical when I got this bra. But it proved to be the best bra I ever wore! Love the light blue color that I got and its really smooth to the touch on the cups. Liked that the adjustable straps were in front. Also love the little bow in the middle. Will definitely buy the pink and white ones. Thank goodness I don't have to wear under wire to get the support I need. I didn't even notice I had it on! And thankfully no red marks on my shoulders or itchiness anywhere.Hope they never discontinue this bra!!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Wow, I'm pretty shocked as to how many positive reviews this bra has.  The cup is shaped very weird, When on, it makes my boobs look like torpedoes!  And it pushes them wayyy to far apart.  They stick out too much on the sides and just makes the shape of my chest look un-natural.  No bueno.  I see other reviewers have had the same experience as me with this bra.  I sent it back immediately!The Bali #3372 is the one that makes my boobs look great and feel great, even though it's itchy sometimes.  This one looked almost the same, so I gave it a try.  But the way it looks on is very different from the way it looks off."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The bra is well made and probably would last a long time, but the sizing on it seems off from other Bali bras.  I have been wearing Bali bras for quite a few years and love them, but they have discontinued the one that I have been wearing and I have been looking for something similar, thought this might be it, but it's not. This bra would probably work better for a larger breasted woman, has wider straps both for shoulder and the back and the cups seems cut for larger breasts.  Had to send this one back, will keep looking."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am skeptic about buying cloths online but I thout I will give a try. And I am not disappointed .I just got my bra today. The bra made really nicely,fits perfectly and gives a really good support. I got this bra for sleep in and I can't wait to use it for this purpose. It is a great bra for a great price.Update: after wash and wearing for a couple times bra cups got misshaped. Looks weird - half empty. My guess they run size bigger .If I could I would take off a star."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been wearing this style for several years now and it is truly the most comfortable and best fitting bra I've ever had. Of course everyone has a different shape so you'll have to try it for yourself to see if it suits. Washes easily in the washing machine on gentle (and inside a lingerie bag), dries quickly, and off you go again. Several of my girlfriends have also started wearing this bra since they saw mine at my swimming club, and they love it too. I don't understand the person who said it didn't have an underwire - they must have shipped her the wrong thing - as it does indeed have underwiring. Also, only 2 hooks high at the back, not the corset-like 3 hooks (like so many of the bras made for larger gals have). Just great, and highly recommended."}

{"label": 8, "raw": "Wacoal doesn't make the style I've been wearing anymore but this new style is a good substitute. It fits well, is true to size and quite comfortable...for a bra, that is. I like this style as well as the old style. Kinda nice to have a change. This is a good everyday bra...should last a long time. Wacoal makes good quality, good fitting bras that wear well. A bit pricey but worth it. I got the white but would like to get the other colors when they become available."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have these in nude and black.The nudes have lasted much longer than your standard grocery store hose, which is nice and expected for $8 hose.  I've worn them three or four times and they're still fine.The black I'm wearing now - put on for the first time and I already had to use nail polish to stop little tiny holes from growing. (My nails were filed and I wear hose all the time so I know how to put them on carefully.) It could be that these holes are just  more noticible with black.I love that these do not have the rubber elastic in them, which is hard to find and why I purchased them.However, the band is two times as long as it needs to be. Even with my garters cinched up all the way, I struggle all day making sure that the band doesn't peek out from my knee length skirt when I sit down.  That's particularly awkward for job interviews and such."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am 5'5\" and about 160 lbs. I got the size Queen 1 because of the reviews saying to get a size up since they cut into your thigh. I am wearing these with a garter belt under a dress so I needed them to fit comfortably. I got nude, and I am very pale and the color works. They aren't too shiny either. This size is supposed to fit up to 225 lbs and 5'6\" and they fit pretty well on my thigh but the lace band sits pretty low. It starts just a few inches above my knee, so keep that in mind. You will need adjustable garter straps and a knee length dress. I can't wait to try these on with my garter and dress!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I agree with most of the other reviewers here; these are wonderful.  A garter-belt or bustier is a must with these, because there is no \"stay-up\" band in these stocking-tops, and if you ask me, imho, it's much better that way.I just adore the darling lace applique of the stocking-tops, and the sheer stockings are very elegant and sexy.  The lace design is simple enough that it pairs well with many different garters, be they solid or lacy.I got these in \"city beige\" (a bit darker than nude) and black (although not TOO black, but rather a lovely shade that isn't really \"smoky\" but adds a wonderful black shimmer to your legs) and loved both colors.  I will definately be ordering more of these.Very sexy and elegant!  I strongly recommend these."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these for my partner for a bit of role-reversal and they fit him lovely.  Actually, since he is a bit short, the straps were a bit long and the stockings did sag a bit, but they kept their shape.  The garter fits female and male hip and waist sizes and do stretch pretty well without ripping.  They look and feel quite comfortable and (since I've never worn garters and undergarments without dealing with this issue) they are very easy to pull down when using the restroom.  Needless to say, I had to try them on too, and I liked them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The first thing I noticed was the frayed edges on the lace that were unraveling right out of the package.  The hose are indeed quite thin and while I managed not to put a run in them, I can't imagine they would last anywhere near a good pair of L'Eggs.  They were a bit hard to get on (imagine putting on your garters with your hose together, good luck getting it straight the first time...!) but, you get used to it.  What I would never get used to is that once I sat down to dinner and then stood back up, the garter was now riding halfway down my butt!  The host themselves were now down near my knees, with the lace tops well below where a mid-thigh skirt would hit.  Nope, these are going in the trash."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm pale skinned with pink undertones. I ordered \"barely there\", (the title next to a light shade of hosiery) and if by \"barely there\" they mean \"VERY OBVIOUSLY there\", then they've really nailed it with their subtley sarcastic description.These hose were brown, like a dark taupe. The photo clearly shows a lighter shade. So, anyway, the point of this review is, if your skin tone is like mine, don't make the same mistake I did by assuming the shades shown represented how these hose *actually* look in real life."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love these pantyhose and have worn them in the past.  The reason that I gave 3 stars is that the sizing info isn't helpful.  When you click on it, you see sock sizes.  There should be a chart online, just as there is on the back of the pantyhose package.  So, I'll return them because of incorrect sizing.  I have ordered another size.  However, I do appreciate being able to get the color pearl.  In the stores, they are mostly brown.  I have fair skin, so brown pantyhose don't look right on me."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have very swollen lower legs and feet when I sit a lot, fly, or stand a lot.  I have a lot of compression knee hi socks and a pair of thigh highs. They worked pretty well in reducing the swelling, but never all the way, plus the elastic would dig into my leg at the base of my knee and leave a big groove.  My toes got pulled tight too.  Then, I found these socks.This brand and style and compression level are perfect in every way.  They don't dig into your leg at the top, they don't pull on your toes, they are very comfortable, look sporty, and they keep all of the swelling in my legs away.  I have 3 pairs now but I plan to get a few more.  So glad I stumbled upon this brand and style."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The Good:  I love these socks.  They are very well built and I feel like I have a sock that will last for years.  They are great for walking around the house with no shoes.  Their elastic around the calf is well made and I have yet to have a pair start to get loose on me.  The warmth is fantastic and they feel comfortable with all types of shoes.The Bad:  They are thick, but this is probably why you bought them anyway.  Just be aware that you may have tight shoes start to fit strangely because of that thickness."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased these for hiking primarily, but after wearing them for a day I wish I had a pair for every day of the week. They are extremely comfortable. I have sweaty feet and these certainly help wick the sweat away from my skin. Now the the weather is a bit cooler these are my go to socks. It's been about 2 months now and I wear these at least once a week, and they still look like new. Build quality seems to be very high and the padding is still think and comfy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been trying to find a pair of trail running socks, but most everything I've seen or tested is at both ends of the spectrum - either too thick and tall, or too thin and short. Although they are called Hiking/Outdoor Socks, I would not consider them trail running. They are very comfortable due to thickness, but that's not what I want in a trail sock. Still, I can't fault them for hiking because they are quality made and feel good in hiking shoes/boots."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am a woman who loves wearing men's levi's in this fit (or 555, 501, 565).  I had gastric bypass and just like how they hang and the weight/thickness of the jean material.  Most women's jeans are thinner, shallow pockets and have spandex, which I don't need.  I like the tighter fit, seems to keep everything tight.  And without the spandex, the jeans are warmer for the colder climes.  I've always been a levi's fan!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Levi's 505 jeans have been my go-to work pants for about the past 20 years.  I could go to any store, and pick up a pair with the 505 label, waist 33, and length 32, and have them fit just like every other pair I own.  However, Levi has decided to re-shape these, but to retain the same 505 label.  They are now designed for the teenage boy, twenty-something market.  They sit uncomfortably low, on the hips rather than at the waist. They are tighter in the crotch. I suppose boys want to show off their &#34;package.&#34;  I've spent the past year or so trying to find something to replace to old 505's, but with only limited success. These are no longer your father's jeans.  Too bad for me that I'm still your father."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've always worn Levi's jeans. Recently, however, they don't seem to last like they used to. Jeans that I have bought within the last 5 years or so, seem to wear out faster than older pairs I've had. Particularly around the pockets and the seam in the crotch. The material seems thinner too. While this makes them a tiny bit more comfortable, they don't make 'em like they used to. Still kinda expensive too, but they go on sale every once in a while. Or I can use points to buy."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So annoying. I've been wearing Levi's 505 as long as I can recall. The move to overseas production has really hosed up the quality of these jeans, though. And they are terribly, terribly inconsistent. In the most recent instance, I ordered two pairs from the same seller through Amazon, in different colors. What I've noticed over the last few years is that different colors appear to be made by different foreign factories -- some in Mexico, some in China, some in Bangladesh, etc. And depending on where they are made, the weight of the fabric and the actual fit is quite inconsistent. When I order these things, I want/expect them to fit the same way, every color, every time. Not an unreasonable expectation, I think. Levi Strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years. Evidently, though, like most other American businesses they have simply ceased to give a rip, opting for comparatively inexpensive labor and compromised quality. Makes me frickin' sad."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have purchased 4 pairs of Levi's 505 jeans in the last two years.  Altogether, I have 6 pairs of 505's.  The problem is that four of the six pairs I have are over 10 years old.  Yep, the pre-2000 jeans wear like iron while the post-2009 jeans wear out.  This last pair (made in Central America) fit well and are comfortable.  I'm giving them 4 stars because, they are comparable with the ones I have purchased recently and fit fine.  If you are comparing these jeans to those from years ago, however, they would be two stars."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Levi's jeans remain a reliable and consistent staple. This Levi's Men's 505 Straight (regular) fit jean retains quality fabric and classic styling. The legs are not too narrow or too wide. The design is comfortable, classy, and no-nonsense. These jeans are versatile, and can be dressed up or down. We personally can not abide passing fashion trends, with guys wearing girlfriend-style jeans, or rolled-up cuffs. In contrast, Levi's jeans are cool and timeless, like the Rolling Stones and ZZ Top. They work for men whether urban or country. Enjoy!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I grew up wearing Levi jeans, and these new Levis are not what they used to be, that's for sure. Levis cut their jeans in a way that fit me better than most other jeans I've tried, but the denim Levi is using these days just does not measure-up to their competitors denim what so ever. I got these 505 jeans in the rigid un-washed denim, so it's the heaviest denim Levi uses, but they still feel like weak pants with all the fabric-body of a worn-out bed sheet. I used to love my Levis, but now I hate where I see the quality of their products are heading."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The Seller is terrific ordered and it shipped and received in BETTER than a timely fashion!! Now.the jeans although feel and fit very nice,still do not feel like they use to back in the good ole days of 505 and 501 Levis!! This does not mean that I do not like the feel and comfort,they do feel very good and fit very nicely , I certainly will purchase another couple of pairs of these in the future especially from this seller!! But I would have given out a 5th star if I found that the quality of the jeans were they way I remember them from the 70's and 80's!! Those felt like,you know ,the way cars were built back in the 50's and 60's firm/strong/ built to last??? But this is the world today! Recommended and buy from this seller;they are GREAT!! Thanks"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline, an endless abyss. The back label, which supposedly should be leather, now seems to be made &#8203;&#8203;of cardboard and a lousy finish. The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least, in my experience, has been. I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world. Previously, a Levis jeans was a piece \"almost perfect\", today I can not say the same. I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These jeans are awesome.  I see that there are a lot of negative reviews about how Levi's changed the fit of these jeans (however long ago...), but I wasn't wearing them back then so I cannot speak to that issue.  But from what I can tell there shouldn't be any complaints about fit!  These jeans look great and fit well.  They are also high quality.  What else could you want?  Them to come with money in the pockets?  Well me too but that goes for everything I buy.  Get a pair, you won't regret it!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these Levis because I haved owned many pairs in the past and they have always been good quality jeans I could trust. Levis was recently bought and since has tried to change their look to appeal to the younger crowd. They messed with just about every type of jeans except the 501 but that has button fly and I prefer a zipper fly. The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I can't stand it. My old 505s did not do this. The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them. They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle. These are horrible jeans in terms of fit and quality, look elsewhere until this company learns it lesson not to mess with a good thing."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I don't like that the different styles are made in different locations so you never really get a consistent make or wear with Levi's anymore.  This particular &#34;lot or batch&#34;  was good.  However, they seem to be thinner than usual.  Not really sure if that a new thing.  They have 7 belt loops.  Some poor reviews stated they had 5.  This again may be a consequence of multiple manufacturing facilities.Overall, basic Levi quality with expected characteristics.  Price is more reasonable online than most store retailers.  I think this offsets risks."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was glad to find these jeans in a size 35 waist, since I had only seen Levi's in even-sized waist only. The color is a great stonewash hue, ideal for me. Two important differences compared to the 501's: ONE, the 505 has a zipper instead of metal buttons on the fly (a well-known feature); TWO, less known is that the rise in the 505's is lower than the 501's. The difference in the rise, in my pants is a 1 1/2\" lower rise in the 505's, something I am not used to."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been wearing Levi 501s for over 25 years. By mistake I ordered these 505s instead of 501s. It took a little getting used to having a zipper instead of button fly. Actually I think the zipper may help increase the life of my jeans. Over time the buttons have tended to wear the buttonholes on my 501s making them a little loose.These 505s fit just as well as my 501s have fit over many years. I'll almost certainly continue to buy Levis for the next 25 years. The only question will be: 501 or 505?"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have to agree with some of the other reviewer comments regarding the decline in quality for Levi jeans.  The material seems a lot thinner than the last pair of jeans I purchased.  Besides the flimsy material the jeans didn't fit well either.  I have worn the same size jeans for the past several years.  I would swear the pair I just purchased on Amazon was at least a size too big. I ended up buying the size pair of Lee jeans on Amazon and they fit just right and the quality of material was a lot better.  Lee jeans has a new customer."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I lost some weight and had to buy new 505's for the first time in years.The new 505 style is a lot less baggy and I look much thinner.When you try them on, you should realize that the jeans will initially feel tight.  However, after washing, drying and wearing them for a few hours, there's a lot more room in the thigh and waist; perhaps as much as 1 or 2 inches. When I first put them on, the jeans were a bit tight around the waist -- now I have to wear a belt.DON'T JUDGE THE PANTS UNTIL YOU'VE WASHED, DRIED AND WORN THE PANTS FOR A FEW HOURS."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I got a 38 by 29 for my husband in &#34;Fume&#34; color and oh boy does he look HOT! I'm in love with this color, plus the fit was awesome and way beyond my expectations.Hubby doesnt have a body like a model, he's got a bit of belly (at 5'9&#34; and 215 pounds), so I was apprehensive about how this straight fit was gonna work out..because it's actually more like a slim fit, but it looks great.I was tired of him wearing &#34;relaxed fit&#34;...too baggy for my taste..too much like &#34;pop jeans&#34;...no offense for guys who like the style.I wanted something...how can I put it?!....something younger, fit and svelte, to make his legs look longer...and I'm very pleased with these 505.I will definitely buy him more, in other colors."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is my last time of buying Levis.  Order this model and 2 others at the same time during an Amazon sale. Been wearing the same and models for decades.  The quality and fit of the fabric just isn't there anymore.  One pair got a hole in the upper thigh after the first washing.  All the jeans I bought this time, stretch out within hours of wearing.  I have a 31 inch waist, and if I do not have a belt on these jeans are sliding way down within an hour.  This is after washing and drying 5 times.  Ended up going to Marshall's and getting much higher quality jean for half the price.  Sad  to see a company like Levi let themselves forget about their customers. They are so focused on producing at the loweest price, that they no longer seem interested in producting a quality product.  Too bad"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered these Levis thinking I may have lost a little weight so I would get them a size smaller than usual.  I think manufactureres are lieing to us to make us feel good.  These jeans were a good deal too large even though ordered a smaler size.  I have a pair of Levis that I have had for a long time in the same size as these and they are really snug on me. I still love Levis and won't change to another brand I would like to warn buyers that a size 36 waist is mor like a 38.  They are still high quality though and I guess I can now say a 36 waist is too big on me and my diet was a great success.One important thing - The price was really good and I will buy more in a smaller size - Man my diet is easy!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I had previously purchased a pair of these jeans from a store and liked them so much I ordered a darker color from Amazon. They are listed as exactly the same fit, style, and size but the ones purchased from Amazon are more snug around the waist for me (this was before any washing). They also have a chemical smell from all the dye used but I'm sure there are some tricks to remove that so it isn't really a concern. It does make me wonder if the dying process somehow shrinks jeans as the darker pair is more snug but I'm not sure. If I could do it again I would probably just purchase them at the store after having tried them on as the previous pair I purchased locally was the same price."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn this bra for many years.  Had trouble finding it and then... of course... found it here on Amazon. (LOVE Amazon)The cups are now almost 'bullet shaped'.  I feel like I should be back in the 50's or in a Madonna video.  It is very strange.  Nothing like before.  That being said... it is still very comfortable and they did eliminate the tag by stamping the label inside the back strap... which I like.  But the cup shape is so strange that I will not buy again."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have worn this style for several years now and this is the first time I have ever purchase them online.  They are not the same bra. They have changed the way they have made it. they are using cheaper products, less material around the wire so it rubs against your skin and my boobs look pointed in these for some reason, my other one's do not do that. ( I purchased my other bra's at macy's and JCPenney)  Are they worth 24 dollars ( give or take).  Not really, I keep telling myself, self.... do not purchase anything you can't try on, online, but do I listen....no....and I'm almost always disappointed with the clothing and shoe purchases."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have avoided purchasing Wacoal bras because of their price.  The bras are typically twice the price of competitors.  However, I decided to try this bra on in a department store and was sold.  The bra is extremely comfortable.  It minimizes while maintaining a natural shape.  The material is soft and looks smooth under clothing.  The straps are wide enough for support without digging into your shoulders.  I can actually wear this bra all day without having any shoulder or back fatigue by the end of the day.  It does cost more than other bras, and you rarely find it on sale, but the price is well worth the comfort the bra provides.  It is also well constructed.  With proper care (hand washing and line drying) the bra will last longer than those of competitors."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I agree with all the reviews that say the band on this bra runs small.  For comparison's sake, I am usually a 38 band and I have the Champion 1602 that is a 38ddd.  I measured it against this bra and it was the same length as the 44!  To me that's a huge difference. But when I tried on the 44ddd of this Wacoal it did not feel secure, so maybe the short length has something to do with the stretch of the material.  It didn't seem a lot stretchier than my Champion though."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just recently received my waist cincher (medium) it's the first corset-like product that I will be using after gaining some weight and being limited as to what I can do as far as Exercise goes which is almost non-existent. This garment is made with great quality. I hear the customer service is Excellent which is very important and most people say these undergarments are Better than Spanx! Also some people said not to go by the chart well I looked at it and was between numbers so I went with the higher NO. I don't know if I should have done that or not so I have a Black Medium. From what I can tell it holds you in well and I really like it a lot, I now know where to go for these type of products and Highly Recommend!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This waist cincher is perfect to accentuate an hourglass shape. The inner-contour bands in the middle help create a fierce silhouette. I regularly wear steel-boned corsets, and find this to be a great summer alternative. For comfort, I suggest wearing a corset liner underneath if you wear for an extended period of time. Next time I order, I will size down as it is not snug enough for my taste. Remember to buy cincher by waist measurement. Pair with a bullet bra for an extreme look that is bound to turn heads."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This waist cincher is just what I hoped for and more. After carefully reading the reviews, I ordered the large even though my waist is 33 inches. I was worried that it wouldn't fit or make much difference, but the results were fantastic. It highlights my hourglass figure and makes me feel much more confident in clingy dresses. As others have mentioned, it won't work under very clingy and thin fabrics because the fasteners will show through.I have worn this for hours at a time, including on a long car ride, and it is more comfortable than expected. It also helps my posture, which is nice. FInally, I appreciate that it is easy to care for--I just wash it on the delicate or handwash cycle and hang to dry. I was so pleased with it that I ordered another in beige."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I washed it one time and started to have problems. When I wore it stayed in place and held everything together then I washed it and the stitching started to come loose. I had to sew some of the hooks back in place but it still worked. Maybe the idea is not to keep it on long but I wanted to wear it to work. (they say women carry themselves differently if you wear things like this under your cloths). So I needed it for longer wear which this did not stand up to all the daily movement."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This waist cincher is perfect for those who don't have a whole lot to pack in, but want a smooth, long line.  I also like it because the garter straps can be significantly shortened, so the tops of my stockings are not down near my knees at the end of the day.  It is comfortable but sturdy - no weird poking or pinching - and it holds its shape throughout the day.  Finally, this is much more visually appealing than most waist cinchers/tummy flatteners out there.  Highly recommended."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "As another reviewer mentioned, it's hard to find an XS girdle/shaper and this one certainly does the job of taking away a couple inches off my waist to look great in wedding dress. However all of the cinching is at the waist and perhaps not enough in the hip area which gives you an almost unnatural silhouette: tiny waist, big hips, flattened top of butt - my torso and hips feel a bit like 2 sausage links separated at the waist but on the good side it gives you a very 50s  bombshell figure under the RIGHT type of clothes. I don't recommend wearing it under fitted or slinky clothing, for me that looks a little bizarre and you can clearly see the hooks. But it is perfect under layered clothing, much like a wedding dress!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this several years ago and am now ordering a second one. It really works well. Just so you know at first you will think it is too small but once you hook it up it fits snug but comfy. Start from the top when hooking together. It makes my waist look tiny and smooths my little muffin top, helps make tummy look flatter. I have bought several different kinds but this one is the only one I continue to use. Well worth the $30 I spent. I have it in black, in extra small. I am 5'2, 120, I use to be 100-110, but this still fits good. I call it my winter weight lol."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ended up gaining a lot of stress weight just before my wedding, and needed to cinch in so i could lace my dress closed.It is comfortable, and stays in place. Also very breathable.I wore it the whole day.I've worn it since when i needed a bit of extra help getting into dress pants.Been through about 7 washes, and just got a small tear on the inside.Also take note that the garter clips are removable.Goes clear up to almost my bra in the front.Was well worth the money."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Pros:>This product provides a lot of support>Has a great little hidden pee vent>Looks a lot nicer than the photograph>Works great around the hips and for fitting into jeans>Provides decent back supportCons:>Definitely runs on the small size (I bought a size up, but I wish I'd made that 2)>Despite nice loose rubber lace edges to smooth out the lines, still leaves very noticeable indentation rings right in the middle of the thigh>Distributes tummy above the top resulting in a very noticeable spare tire tummy above the waist (looks extremely odd and noticeable)>Permanent metal garter clasps that can be painfulSum:Probably good if you just want to fit into jeans, but buy at least one size up, and don't even think about wearing under any but the loosest clothing and probably with a jacket."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I hate bounce. I'm a 36DD, and like high impact sports. While this bra didn't completely eliminate bounce, it certainly reduced it to a more comfortable level. I can do intervals in this, play basketball, and jump around to my hearts content. I still sometimes do the double bra technique with this bra, but this is probably the only bra I'd wear on its own for high impact sports.Upside: best bra around for minimizing bounceDownside: Ugly. No getting around that. You can't wear cute little tops with this. But when you don't have painful bounce, you can live with a little more coverage."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I just received my bra in the mail and I am so happy.  I am a 36F (I bought a size 2) and this is the first sports bra that actually fits without making my breasts ooze out in my arm pits.  I have run around the house, jumped up and down and no bounce, NONE! Yay! I will be using it for roller derby and hopefully I will stop getting penalties for having my elbows out because I couldn't tuck them close to my body.  This really feels like my centre of gravity has changed.  Very pleased. Oh and my husband says it's very flattering also."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I purchased this for my husband as a gift.  He says it's the best thing he's ever gotten.  He loves the space inside and the separate compartments.  Since he works in 48-hour shifts, he uses it every single day.  He said that the rubber bumpers on the bottom of the bag are perfect for keeping the leather out of counter messes both at work and at home, and that he is able to fit all of his daily bathroom supplies inside with room to spare.  Great quality!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered 2, and actually preferred the tan finish (tone was gorgeous, and more even in appearance).  The tan was missing a \"leg\" however; it has rubber to keep it off the countertop, so I sent it back.  I kept this one for my husband, which I intended as a gift.  A bit of miscommunication has them refunding instead of exchanging the tan, no biggie, we shall figure that out. The bag(s) itself is great.  I can't wait to see how it ages, it, like few products these days, appears to be built for the long haul.  I anticipate it will look great for years, if it's cared for."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought these gloves a few months ago because I needed a good pair of running gloves when my morning runs were normally in the 25-30 degF range. I purchased them based on other reviews that claimed that they'll keep your hands warm while still letting them breath.The woven material sure lets your hands breath but that also makes my hands feel cold. As your body and hands move while you run (or even just walking) you'll feel the cold air hitting your hands and it was uncomfortable for me. My hands didn't feel frozen but it was unpleasant. I definitely wouldn't call it warm. When the temps were closer to 40 degF my hands felt better but you still feel the cold air.They seem to be a good quality glove that fits me well and should last a long time but they're not some magical fabric that manages to keep your hands warm while at the same time letting cold air hit them. My BS detector must be on the fritz."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm not sure what to think.  I have been searching for this color for a long time.  I finally found it and it wasn't $35, so I bought it.  It is a beautiful dark brown.  I got the right size.  The only thing is, I just don't like under wire bras.  I had hoped that it wouldn't be so bad, but alas, under wire is under wire, and it is annoying.  So, I will wear it, but not as often as I'd like."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a great bra. It's comfortable and provides good support. I also like the shape of it. It comes down low enough so I can wear lowcut tops without the cups peeking out. It also doesn't ride up my back, which is a plus. I've had that problem before.My only complaint is that after a while (say, a few months), it does start to stretch out a little bit, so it's not as supportive as it was in the beginning. That said, I really like this bra and I continue to buy it simply because I haven't found any other bras that I like as much as this one."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this bra and ordered a few of them because finding a bra that fits is like heaven. An uncomfortable bra is like ill-fitting shoes and makes me cranky. I had purchased this size/style in a store so I knew it would fit. In general, I think the cup might run a little small. The thing I like is that the padding is thick enough that no one can tell when you're &#34;cold&#34; when wearing a think t-shirt, yet I don't feel overstuffed."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra fits well and the demi look is sexy.  Nice to have a sexy bra in my size, 34D.  The fit is on the small size.  This is a good choice for those of us with short torsos.  The side wings don't cut into me like on a lot of bras and as others have said the straps are very adjustable.What I don't like about the bra is that the underwire is scratchy, and the cup tops are visible under t-shirts.  Maidenform demi cups show under t-shirts on me, I'm not sure why.  I do have one Wacoal demi that is completely invisible, so I know it's possible to create an invisible demi."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I found this bra on sale for $7 at TJMaxx a while back and I didn't think I'd like it, but it was such a good deal I thought I'd give it a shot. I ended up loving it! I got it in the black and beige striped print and it's gorgeous! I have gotten so many compliments on it from friends, women at the gym, and my boyfriend (I don't think I've ever gotten complimented on a regular, everyday bra before, only the special occasion stuff). It seems very true to size and is comfy. Unlike some demi bras, the cups are cut low enough that it doesn't show out of the top of scoopneck shirts or tank tops. Another think I love about it is that the strap adjustment ring is in the front, not in the back, so it's easy to adjust perfectly, with out having to call in a friend for help lol. Definitely recommended."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Just a really comfortable bra and the color is great because it doesn't show through anything.I wash it in the washer in a lingerie bag and hang it to dry and it still has held its shape and size after months of wear.  The cups are still very smooth, no weird wrinkles or anything! Shoulder straps don't  fall off my tiny shoulders like a lot of bras do, which I realllly appreciate. And when I change the length part, it doesn't move from that spot while I'm wearing it.There's nothing particularly fancy about this bra, but when I wear this bra, I forget that I'm wearing it - it's that comfortable. Plus, I'm a 34a, so I appreciate the lift and padding help!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered 2 of these bras for my girlfriend, because she got too big for her previous bras, (that's a Great Problem to have. LOL!). I liked the way the looked in the pictures, and most of the ladies in the reviews absolutely raved about them; so I thought I would give them a try.First, the price was less than half of what I paid at the local Victoria Secret's. My girlfriend says since I so fond of her breast, I am responsible for keeping them looking good. (I have absolutely NO PROBLEM with that. LOL!)Long story short, they arrived very quickly, they fit her very very well, and they look GREAT!!!I definitely will be ordering more in many colors. WOOO HOOO!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear nothing else and needed a new pair of boot cut. I might start wearing something else if Levi doesn't do something about what's going on with its labor force. C'mon Levi! You're charging enough for each pair of these things. Spread it around to those who make them for you. Had to be said.I really might never buy them again after recent news, but you want only to know about the jeans. They're Levi's, which, despite Brett Favre's claims, are still the best, albeit overpriced.Mainly, I can always count on them fitting, and once again these do. Best for me this time is the 35\" waist, which is unusual for Levi's."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law. He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants, but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any! So, I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns (laundry is at my house) and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn. I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he hasn't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants. When I slip in the new ones, I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses.  I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet?"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This has to be a knock off. I've worn K Swiss shoes for as long AS I can remember. This is my first attempt at buying them online. I'll never do it again. The soles are removable in these shoes, which real K Swiss does not do. They are so uncomfortable! Like walking on 2x4's. They are super heavy and bulky. They don't soften up, and now because they were worn to find all of this out, I doubt I can return them. Save your money and buy them at the store to make sure it's a real K Swiss shoe because this shoe is terrible!!!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "60% COTTON and 40% POLYESTER T SHIRT. Now, it was described as 100% cotton, and that's what I wanted to buy. If the sellers are not able to honestly describe their product, then they will lose the ability to sell to people via the web. ITS IMPERITIVE that the sellers are honest, for us to buy sight unseen.  People don't realize, perhaps, that polyester cotton blended cloth is much cheaper than pure cotton. PURE COTTON breathes in hot weather, and absorbs sweat better.  The shirt looks OK, the color and size is nice, so is the cut.  BUT, it will wear out MUCH faster, than 100% cotton. It wont fade in that cool way that 100% cotton does, nor will it shrink a bit, which is why I buy 2X for 100% cotton. I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED, especially because my TIME was wasted, simply because the seller felt like being dishonest."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought this cincher to wear under a dress in an upcoming wedding I'm attending.  I estimated the size I needed, and ordered a Large.  I'm 5'4&#34; and 170 (and losing!!)  I was nervous at first, because it didn't seem like it would fit, but once I got it on, it fit great!  No struggle to get on either.  I pulled my dress on over it and Voila! The hour-glass shape I was looking for!!  It flattened my belly and pulled in my sides over my hips!!  I'm so happy with the results!!  I kept it on through the evening last night to see how it felt as it settled on my body, and it doesn't seem to shift.  There is a slight amount of rolling on the top, but its really not bad.  I'm very pleased with this undergarment!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "After reading all the reviews posted here, and considering the sizing guidelines, I ordered an XL of this waist cincher. I have no difficulty at all putting this on - it hooked up quickly with no real pulling or struggle required. This size certainly provides some shaping and support - but not to the extent I'd predicted based on reviews. In hindsight, I should have ordered a L, instead. At some point, after I lose a few more pounds, I will probably dig deep and order the smaller size. The cincher does pull in my waist about a half inch, and it help make me more conscious of my waistline (which helps remind me not to snack!!). As other reviewers have indicated, the bottom of the cincher irritates my skin, even when worn over tights or hose. But overall, I am pleased with my purchase."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are a fantastic addition to my bedroom collection! I got several versions of leg avenue thigh highs to use with a garter belt. These in particular are very sexy. I haven't had any issue with ripping or snagging or being too loose. You don't have to use a garter, but I'd recommend it because while they do stay up long enough to make an impact, but they don't stay that way for long.And seriously, for the price, they are great. You can barely get a bottle of soda these days for this price. Even if they don't last a lifetime (I've only had mine a few weeks), I won't lose sleep if I need to replace them. As with any delicate item, launder these carefully--hand wash only, and don't scrub madly away as if you're ridding the world of germs.They shipped quickly and were packaged well. I have other items from this company and would order more in future."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "All right, let's get right down to it! When it comes down to intimate apparel, there is nothing that captures a man's eyes and imagination as thigh-high stockings!These soft and sexy stockings wear well, and stay up. So, you don't need to use a garter, but I do recommend one. (I don't believe in understatement in the bedroom.)I highly recommend these stockings to you - or for you men, buy them as a gift!(Review of Leg Avenue Women's Stay Up 3-Inch Lace Top Thigh Highs #1022)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I'm not really a plus-size gal (12/14), but I have chunky thighs and I hate the thigh-high mushroom effect, so I went with plus size just to be safe. No luck - these were incredibly tight and very unflattering. There was also an odd greasy residue on the cardboard insert in the package. Of course you can't return stockings once opened, so now I'm stuck with these useless stockings. They really are pretty to look at draped over a hanger, but if you have large thighs, that's about all they're good for.Fortunately, the capable folks at Sock Avenue were able to help - they recommended Leg Avenue's Plus Size Sheer &#34;Lace Top Stockings with Backseam,&#34; which were, oddly, so much stretchier they were almost too big, which was actually perfect. Now I just wish I knew what to do with these!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I loved this watch when I first recieved it but I have quite a collection and don't wear any one watch often. Bought this one in July 2012, it is now January 2013 and I've only worn it 3 times. On the 3rd wearing the band came loose from the face and at this point I can only get a partial refund. NOT COOL!! I have one other Skagen that I purchased at the same time (a browm dial) and now I'm almost afraid to wear that one. Like this one, it is thin and nice to look at. I will not even consider another Skagen in the future. Looks and feels like quality, but NOT!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've had this watch for awhile now and really like it. I think its pretty and goes well with all my bracelets, silver and gold. It runs well and unlike most other comments, i don't have a problem seeing the time. The only issue to aware of is.. if you don't clamp the latch properly, it will fall off after wearing it all day!  That has happened to me twice. Both times someone had picked it up off floor and gave it back..i didn't even know it was gone!  I got lucky. Otherwise, its great!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I really wanted to like this bra. Well, I really wanted it to fit. I have a short torso, so the wires on this bra are simply too long, and poked me in the arm pit as soon as I sat down. If you are petite, this bra might not be the best shape/size for your frame.Despite that issue, the cup size was also a little large - I am typically a G cup, but another site recommends an F for this bra company. I would recommend trying a cup down if you are above a D size.The fabric on the bra is pretty and I love the sheer look. I would have loved to have been able to keep the bra."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered the 32K, per size charts... I think the cups run smaller then the size chart states.The bra is made of a rough material, it rubbed my armpits and cleavage raw after only a few hours.The under-wires poked threw after the second wearing. I only hand washed it.The stitching and seems show threw even heavy tee-shirts...The stretchy straps are a bad idea for large breasts...Overall I am not impressed with the quality of this product. I would not recommend it to women with large breasts."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra offers excellent support for large busted women -- it's very sturdy.  I find that the cups are cut a little too high under the arms and impede arm movement and comfort, but I was told at my local bra boutique that cup sizes F (or maybe it was FF or G - can't remember, but that's the range) and up are cut that way to accommodate the volume of larger breasts so that there's no &#34;spill over&#34; at the underarm area.  Because it covers a lot of area, it's not good for wearing with low cup tops. Overall, this is a very good bra and it's pretty."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I wear a 36 H now that I am nursing, and the medium ++ fits perfect. This is by far my most comfortable nursing bra. I wear it around the house, while sleeping, running errands, and even playing racquetball. The fit is like a sports bra (it does create a &#34;uniboob&#34; look) but it has great support.  If you are looking for a nursing bra for busty women with better shaping for going to work or dressing-up, I recommend the Bravado Bliss Nursing Bra, but definitely buy a Double Plus (or a few) for your days off."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered this bra per the product guidelines..I am very large busted, and I thought this would be a good nursing bra--for not having wires.The only thing this bra is good for is for holding nursing pads in overnight.  There's no support--none.  I can't even imagine it would support me if I was smaller, either.  The fabric is fairly decent, but I am surprised at the positive reviews from the larger busted lady reviews on here.  I recommend the Goddess bra, or glamourmom nursing tanks--this bra was seriously a joke!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this nursing bra. It's super comfy and fairly supportive. But, it fits like a sports bra, giving you a &#34;uni-boob&#34;. Especially if you have a larger chest like me. However, it's perfect for wearing around the house! The one thing I don't like about this bra is the line on the side of your boob. It shows under clothes and can be annoying. As a side note, I wear a 42H while nursing and the Double Plus XL fits just fine. :)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This bra fits great, and is comfortable.  Not \"you won't know you're wearing it\" comfortable, but \"WOW, all this support and I feel fine comfortable.\"The girls get plenty of support, not just north and south, but east and west, too.  They haven't been where they are now for 20 years!  This bra isn't lacy or frou frou, but it is pretty, the the lining does NOT bunch up and have you walking around with the dreaded bosom pleat.  I've never before found a bra with this much support combined with comfort and lining (we're not supposed to have nipples, you know).  I bought it because of the reviews, and I thank the other reviewers because I need look no farther for the perfect bra!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My daughter lives in flip flops during the summer so I wanted to find a pair that was supportive.  Tried Chaco (too heavy) and a Reef Fanning (toe piece hurt) with no luck.  Grabbed my flip  flops that I bought several years ago at REI which were very supportive and comfortable (walked all around Disney last summer on a pouring rain day), and discovered they were Reef slaps.  Found the Slap 2 which has an identical style so I ordered them.  She loves them!  I would like another color but mine are still in great shape after several years' wear."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love these for their support and comfort. I (sadly) just can't wear the tiny cutesy flip flops any more. But I don't care bcs I LOVE these. They do run small so order a size up. ln my opinion, this style has the best/cushy heal . Some others have a hard heal, which I do not recommend. My first pair has last 6 years and I wear them almost daily (I live in FL) and the tread on the bottom is still good but the front toe portion has separated. Worth the cost for sure."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I live in these shoes.  This is my third pair of Newports, and it's one of the only sandals that I literally wear until they fall off my feet.  I get years of wear from every pair.  Of all the Keen sandals, these seem to be the truest fit.  They also have the thickest soles and heaviest toe bumper for foot protection when using them for hiking.  I even use them for backpacking when I'm on trails that are not too technical.  The support is excellent, and the quality is simply the best I've found in any sandal.I bought these through Amazon and the shipping was fast and accurate.  I will buy another pair and I highly recommend these to others."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I like the Keen concept, but they are cheaply built and unacceptable as a beach sandal.  I have the black model and they have turned a dark purple.  The sun or salt water may have caused the change.  I wore them everyday during my Culebra vacation.  The shoes are not sturdy enough to use on a gravel beach.  When I hiked a rocky path, I had to be careful or I would twist my ankle.  My companion wore Teva sandals they proved to be a better casual sandal."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "perfect fit right out of box... I read all reviews and, asked people whom wore Keen sandals; all said order 1/2 size larger. Great advise! Do as suggested. Wore all day, without any rubs or discomfort.I had have tried both New Balance & Merrill barefoot shoes to use while sailing. When the deck got wet from heeling and, spray I lost footing. Ended up on floor, real close to capsizing. Not again. I like the feel Keen sandals so much I now own 2 pair.A shoe to try that's not a sandal, Northface! Nice, too."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The sandal ordered felt very tight on the sides of the foot. I usually order 1/2 size bigger shoes and these were no exception. The length was just right, but there was pressure on the side, at the widest point of the foot. And I do not have a wide foot, any other shoes I have purchased (sandals, sneakers, dress shoes) had fit OK. Otherwise the sandal appeared very well made. I'm giving it 3 stars just because of the fit, quality is very good. I'm returning these and will see if if the same come in wide sizes."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Jockey makes the best panties, especially the tactel line. Received my first pair of the hi cut and the first thing i did was try them on to see if the stretcth, smooth, soft feel was the same as the string bikini. Dead on with size and comfort. i'm 6 feet with a 36 waist and the size 5 is my favorite. Very sexy looking and the fabric holds me in better than any panty. The support is fantastic. The only thing i would change is lower the backside 1-2 inches. With the comfort and fit of this panty,a minor complaint. I'll be buying these in every color. Love them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The backing of the bag that gives its nice shape is made of some kind of wood or other hard material or cardboard.  I was excited to get a \"man purse\" to carry my cell phones instead of attaching them to my belt.  I placed the phones and tried to close the snap button but the backing broke.  It cracked.  I didn't even use the bag yet and the backing cracked in half.  The backing could not even withstand pressure applied to close the snap buttons.  What a major disappointment.  They couldn't make it out of something less brittle?  Useless."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This item is made from a loosely woven fabric and does not in any way resemble the durable military messenger/map pouches.  The strap is narrow, which would cut into the shoulders, too short, and also constructed of a low thread count weave.  This is not recommended for much of anything.  I left it sitting on the table on my patio for two days, and upon moving it, found that in this short space of time, the sunlight had bleached the exposed part several shades lighter to a yellowish tone.  The bang is now two toned.  Since the material is so low grade, I can't even cut it up for scraps.  It is going into the trash can."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I was told about these from my podiatrist and they are good for a wear everyday shoe. I wear these in my shoes everyday and for the most part they are good. They are not like my custom made orthotics but they are decent for everyday wear if you are on your feet all day. I am not sure how they would work in running or work out shoes since your foot is suppose to mold to them. The best method would probably be to put them in the oven like the directions state. I didn't and I just wore them until they stopped hurting and that let me know they molded to my foot, but I don't recommend this method. Use the heated method since it is faster."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am a physician during the day and an avid basketball player at night. I never use the stock insoles that come with my nike basketball shoes. They just won't cut it. The Sole inserts are the best non-prescription orthotic grade insoles your can buy over the counter (internet). These will mold to your feet after heating them in the oven for a few minutes. The arch supports and padding are fantastic. They add to your balance and help to align your back and prevent foot injuries. I have at least 10 pair of these and I love 'em. They are the best."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is a handy sun visor. It does not mess up my hair since it just slips on. It does not give me headaches. I frequently wear it in the car to help cut down on early morning or late afternoon sun glare. On a breezy day it does not flip away from my face like the brim of my favorite sun hat. When I am going inside and outside I can slip it around my neck so it doesn't get misplaced. This makes it very convenient when traveling and sightseeing. I currently have 2 in go-with-everything black and tan colors."}

Shipped quickly and arrives in good shape, looks great, can easily be kept behind my car seat for when I need it, it doesn't hurt my head AND most of all, the skinny sides don't ruin my short hairstyle when I take it off or put it on!  I'm on my 3rd one...they are really comfy and useful in the hot California sun and wind!  (o:"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I own at least 5 or 6 golf visors.  I bought this one because I am constantly in search of a more comfortable one.  This one had such great reviews I felt that this must be super comfortable - NOT!!  No Headache Visor?  YES, BIG headache!!  By about the 4th hole it felt like my head was in a vise.  I guess I always thought I had an average sized head, and no one has ever told me otherwise, but maybe not?  All I know is that I've never had another visor, or any other hat for that matter, fit as tightly as this visor - this thing was just plain awful!  I won't be wearing it again!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This jacket is not meant to keep you warm in freezing temperature. It is good for running a few miles or wearing it over a sweater on a rainy day. I got an Extra Small Maroon and it's 35 inches around the chest area and 32 on the waist area.It can be rolled up to a ball and doesn't take a lot of space if you take it on a trip. It is durable and VERY light weight. It is water resistant and the hood covers your head, if you zip it all the way up it covers your mouth and just leaves your eyes and your nose exposed. Recommended for those who are always out hiking in the morning or joggers in cold weather. If you wear this on a 40 degree weather you will feel the temperature for sure. The color is nice and design is simple. The fabric is thin, almost like an umbrella and durable."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This is my second casio watch and I like my purchase.  The face of the watch is bit larger than a quarter.  It is pretty much unisex, I had no qualms using it.  My wrist are thin, and this watch looks great.  The best part about the watch is that it is pretty much waterproof so I don't fear it breaking when I forget to take it off when I for instance wash the dishes.  It is durable, the face can scratch easily but so far I have taken good care of it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Finally, finally, finally a strapless bra that is still where I put it on  when I take it off as long as 9 - 10 hours later.  I have never owned a strapless bra that did not, quickly or within 2 hours end up at my waistline unless I was continually tugging, pulling and wiggling it up to where it was meant to be.  It does not slide sideways either, I have had some that actually turned sideways unless I cinched them up to the point that breathing was a difficulty.  This bra is also comfy and has a good amount of cushion for softness.The fit is very true.  Wash in cold water and hang up to dry.  I am considering ordering another on just because it has taken me 40 years to find one that really works, I am worried it will disappear and I will not be able to get another one."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The product did fit a hair bit bigger than exspected but thats my fault for ordering a pair of shoes a half a size bigger than I normally wear.  Even so I love these shoes they are very comfortable. I bought them for use in the gym. Best pair of shoes for lifting in my opinion. Opposed to all these toe shoe people that have to or should wash them after every use. Stylin with my fuctional green kicks while I watch the bar bow from the massive weight I just ripped off the floor. (well massive weight for me). On a side note if you require walking any distance over irregular shaped gravel, covered in moon dust I suggest walking to the gym in your normal shoes. Feel every pebble from being spoiled from wearing shoes all the time."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The fit is good, the color is perfect, the quality is great,  but, the All-Star emblem is on the INSIDE ankle of each shoe. NO, they are NOT on the wrong feet. Dad, Mom, and grandparents checked for right shoe on the right foot. Yep! Both shoes were on the correct feet. This pair of Chuck Taylor All-Star Hi- Top Kelly Green Canvas Shoes are DIFFERENT, but we will definitely keep them and our granddaughter cannot wait to wear them to school to show her Hi Fashion Friends. Will we buy others? Absolutely!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Well I love Dickie's stuff, so I'm biased. Hey, their work clothes hold their shape without ironing, they are water resistant, stain resistant, don't tear easily, and are not expensive. I needed this for my job which requires black or white shirt and I needed long sleeves to cover my tattoos. I am not tall, and my arms aren't that long, but these sleeves were actually perfect for me. I can't say that about most XL button downs I have with long sleeves. I can actually wear a large but I like my work shirts a bit loose so I can move around better without untucking the thing. It is long so stays tucked in pretty good. For wearing untucked it's a bit long but okay enough. I will order more of these just to wear to go to dog park, or even go out swing dancing watching my friend's rockabilly bands."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have liked Dickies products for a long time now.  The work shirts are just slightly larger than a T-shirt would fit.  I understand most mechanics or workers like it a little looser, but it will not fit exactly like a T-shirt might.  It also won't shrink much, if it all, because of the materials it is made from.It keeps you relatively cool, it's very comfortable and durable.  Pretty good price for the quality as well.  Looks good as a work shirt or a casual shirt."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "i absolutely love these shirts for work and for play. i am 5'10\" 185lbs and on the muscular/beefy side and i wear a medium. everything else in the world, i wear a large. even the t shirt under my Dickies shirt (that i am wearing as we speak) is a large. i never need to iron these shirts and they look great and hold up well for the ship work, construction work, and office work that i do. if Dickies could get their sizing more consistent i would buy more of their products."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are very good shirts, great quality for the price and colors match what you see, but with a caveat, They are NOT outdoor-type shirts, and I wouldn't recommend them for barbecues (as the cook, I mean), mowing the lawn, golf, etc. They just don't breathe that well. But, if you're looking for a nice sturdy well-knit short sleeve to wear to work, or to other events, this is the way to go. In other words: classy, sturdy, and overall a good deal. It's not a light, &#34;stay cool&#34; athletic shirt, but works for everything else, it's better than I expected."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit. The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in, but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much. We're required to wear these where I work, and tucked in, so the strange (boxy almost) cut makes it keep coming untucked. The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit, I would but a million!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love Dickies products. They fit nicely, look good and, most importantly, last a long time due to the rugged construction. I only wear short-sleeved shirts because I'm always hot. The shirt and the color are perfect for me to wear in my business casual work environment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, when you take it out of the plastic bag that it comes in, it has a pesticide smell to it. You really have to wash it before wearing to get rid of the smell. But, I do understand why they treat the shirts with the pesticide, it sure beats the alternative."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The price is a bit high, as you can get this at Walmart for much less, but I have found that Walmart sells \"seconds\" or defective material most of the time.  For work, seconds or defective material is usually not a problem with me; I just want to let people know, that cheaper in price usually means cheaper in quality.If you are not familiar with this type of fabric, wear an undershirt as you will have \"wear spots\" in places that you usually don't have with all cotton material.  It's best to break your skin in slowly over time if you are like me and don't wear undershirts.  The sore spots I'm talking about is your nipples.  I hope Amazon allows me to use that word."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I bought the Royal Blue version of this shirt, and I love the bright and vibrant color. However, I don't like the style of the shirt, and I am unlikely to wear it except when everything else is dirty.It has short sleeves like a casual shirt, but then the torso is very long like you are supposed to tuck it in. Are we doing casual or formal? What is the plan, guys? I wear it untucked, but I feel like a slob when I do so.I do not like the breast pocket or the collar.The quality of materials and workmanship seems high."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "My husband really likes these shirts, so they must be comfy.  However he said the second one I ordered for him was a little bit smaller than the first even though I ordered the same size.  He says it still fits him, but I know how picky he is and I'm hoping it doesn't end up at the back of his closet like most do.  I should ad that with these shirts - I do not have to iron them!Update:  So far he is wearing all of the shirts, these are his favorite.  Also the sizing is on the larger side, for this brand we ordered one size down from his usual and I should point out he only likes a 'relaxed' style shirt."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "While it takes a good 4 or 5 washes to soften up, I am very pleased with these pants. They have a nice wide leg opening so they have room to breath, room to bend, while I don't work anymore, if I did these would be great work pants because you can move around easily in them and the knees are reinforced both great qualities for trades people. My only complaints would be that the front pockets are cut at a slant that if you lay down in them or even sitting in the car your change/keys fall out of your pockets. The other complaint is that they come with a crease in them and while the crease came out after several washes and a few passes with an iron, I don't see the need for the crease in work pants. Otherwise I would highly recommend these to anyone looking to put forth a little effort to get a great pair of work pants that I think will last quite a whle."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "The fit was excellent, the pants work well for my husband's job with one slight problem:  they show every speck of dirt  when he's on a job site and it clings to the fabric used in the manufacturing of the pants.  Not sure there is much they can do about this since the durability of the fabric is fantastic and the overall look professional, just wish the dust/dirt wouldn't cling so well despite attempts at brushing it off.  The pants must be washed every night."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "these pants were great for 2 times wearing them. then the next time i was wearing them i was in my car waiting for work and looked down and they were ripped right down the seam.  i work in an emergency room and my stuff takes a beating, these pants could not hold up i guess.  I Recommend the wink pants for men,  i have had them for 2 months and there is no problem.  Another thing wrong with these pants is that the draw string dose not stay tight. i constantly had to keep tieing them and my pants still would fall down.  It came to the point that i had to have nothing in my pockets."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Ah, actually... Some of us retired gray-beards in my neighborhood decided to form an &#34;Old Codgers&#34; club, and denim overalls are the approved uniform. We wear them while sitting in the shade, feeding the birds, and talking about our ailments. These Dickies overalls are great for that purpose! There are pockets enough for phone, watch & chain, pocket knife, handkerchief, wallet, sunflower seeds,whatever the aspiring Codger needs during his day. The material is quite durable, without being too heavy.They do come a bit long, but that is because they are meant to be worn with turned-up cuffs. All things considered, I highly recommend them!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I am very pleased with these overalls.  They feel durable and tough but the material is not too irritating on the skin.  There are ample areas to store sundry items that need to be variously accessible.  The only caveat is that they do run a little small.  I took the advice of other reviews here and ordered a larger size than what I normally would buy for pants.  Even then, there is some struggle fitting in my ample belly, but at least there are buttons on the sides that will allow for adjustment to a looser fit.  Overall, fine overalls."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Compared to other dickies products in the same size, these overall's run a little more snug around the waist. I know they're intended more for work use, but i bought them as a sort of funky/quirky piece to wear around casually. I've got pretty normal proportions, but the legs felt like circus tents and the waist was slimmer than expected. I wanted to love these as they seemed like a fun idea, but unless you're looking to do some fitting modifications I'd say look elsewhere."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This thing keeps me very warm.  The only real tiff with it is that it keeps me a bit too warm.  Right now it is 20 degrees or so in the morning here in Washington state king county and this does a very good job of keeping me warm.  Another thing is that the inside of the jacket is very, well I am not sure how to say it, lose.  When I get sweaty (from this thing keeping me warm) it sticks to me.  BUT, this is exactly why I bought it, to keep me warm.  And I would rather be TOO warm in 20 degree weather than too cold because the jacket doesn't work....just that it sticks to me when I sweat....I want to give it a 4.5 stars but it is in whole stars and not half..."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "This jacket is a good quality heavy water resistant shell, which I find is better for me when used as a basis for layering than as a stand alone jacket.I live in the wet Pacific Northwest, and this jacket works great for fall/winter wear if mixed and matched with different weights of additional shirts/sweaters/hoodies etc.The body of the jacket is lined with fleece, the arms with a lightly padded nylon. I usually pair it with theDickies Men's Brawny Flannel Overshirtand a sweat shirt, which is a perfect combination for our changeable weather.The ability to tighten the bottom and hood of the jacket is quite helpful in a driving rain or strong wind. If you spend a lot of time outdoors, like I do, and engage in active sports or chores/work this jacket can be a useful and practical addition to your wardrobe."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Jeans that fit well and actually sit AT the natural waist, these are them. So many of the recognizable brands of jeans makers out there are producing product that sit below the natural waist. And I think we all know what that translates to when one sits, bends or crouches. Frankly, I don't want to see that, and I don't think others do either. Thank you Carhartt for recognizing this.The B18 Trad-fit jean fits comfortably. They have the right amount of room in all the places one needs the right amount of room without the baggy-ness. These are REAL jeans, not those single stitch, thin denim things sold by the people with sail boats on their catalog covers.  Made of nice, sturdy denim with solid construction, these will hold up well on the work-site. And, if you're a casual social event type, their quality construction and good looks pair well with a shirt and sports coat.Nice jeans that can both work and play."}

I will buy more before the holiday sale ends.Update: 4-20-12. I have 6 pairs now. They have held up very well for 6 months washing and drying. Quality is as good or better than Levi's or Lee jeans.

{"label": 8, "raw": "These pants are very well made and durable.  The stitching is strong, and well-aligned.  The extra side pockets are sized just right for my phone, as I don&#8217;t like putting my phone in the other pockets.  The size is spot on, while the darker color is very nice.  These jeans also have seven belt loops; other brands only have six.  The pockets are extra deep.  The waist is slightly taller than other jeans I have; that is the button is higher up my waist than others, but it is not uncomfortable.  Overall, very impressive jeans."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've had a very hard time finding good, well made, long lasting pants and jeans and in my size.  Due to disability I'm not able to exercise like I used to and I've gotten fat (why lie?) and finding sizes that fit are not that easy.  But even when I was slimmer I noticed that jeans and pants were not lasting as long as they used to. Belt hoops break off, zippers break and on one occasion the inseam from the crotch to the knee simply tore away as if weak threading.Not with CArhartt!  Tough, well sewn and made jeans that you can tell the firs time you hold them they were made to take a beating and keep going!  The size was perfect, fit was perfect, they hold their looks and the price was amazing, a sales price that was unbelievable.  Their regular prices are ok with me as you really do get what you pay for! Thanks Carhartt and Amazon!!!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I ordered two of these Carhartt long sleeve shirts, one in \"Ash\" color, the other \"Navy\" blue. I've had some trouble finding real cotton long sleeve T-shirts (I mean NOT cotton/algodon which is thin and rough feeling) the reason I bought them at Amazon was I've returned so many bought at JCP and Macy and thought I read the description to trust Amazon. ok, the shirts arrived and right away I notice the Ash shirt has that rough feel. Each is made in another country, the Ash is marked 99% cotton and made in Dominican Republic; the blue one is 100% cotton made in Honduras. The Ash shirt shrunk in the first wash so much the sleeves are too short to wear it unless I push up the sleeve. The Blue shirt is fine quality shirt all around. So I'm saying be careful...we just don't know nowdays what we will get for our money."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "A Great light layer. Perfect for rainy weather. LOVE the color and the side vents. You can stuff the whole jacket into the hand pocket. But the jacket is so lightweight, I think for packing it takes up less room laying flat. Love it.Update: I have had this for awhile now and have one issue. The zippers under each arm for the side vents are ripping out.I didn't notice it at first, but then I felt it. They are coming through the sleeve fabric and making holes. On both arms.I love this coat, so this a bummer. So I dropped from 5 stars to 3."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Sadly I left my Marmot lime-ish green raincoat at some beachy eatery this past spring.  I had loved it for two years and even bought one in another color as well.  I could not help but want to replace it. I tried three different Marmot green precip jackets ( and two other brands' green rain jackets as well) before my Marmot Green Envy arrived.  The shade is  a bit too intense, but it comes closest to the color of my lost two-year-old one, as neither Grass nor Bright Grass did.  My main complaint is that the colors shown online were different than the reality--and even different on my laptop and iPad.  So good luck-- but this is a great raincoat which my beach living allows me to use most of the year."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Being well endowed,I have a hard time finding boxers that fit just right.These boxers go on smooth,you can hang loose without falling out,yet it gives you room to grow if need be,also I like the back,just hugs the butt just enough yet stays loose. It feels like your wearing \"bear\"ly nothing.You can sleep in these,if you wish,(won't ride up),lounge and exercise in them.Being hairy,I noticed the white and lite colours boxers,there is some see thru.Also,they do not stick to the skin and living here in the South,we sweat so odor is wicked away.Can wear under shorts and dress/causal pants,jeans with ease. Highly recommend these boxers."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Sometimes clothes can start to feel unfresh after a lot of global air travel, when you've changed time zones, days and haven't had a chance to shower. These perform great for that purpose. The material reminds me very much of &#34;swoosh&#34; basketball shorts. It's not cold but it is a bit more artificial feeling than I'd realize it was. Once it's being worn, that feeling goes away and it's quite comfortable.I haven't washed them in a sink yet, but if I were to go into a situation where I may need to I would have no hesitation to take this and plan for that cleaning option to work. Fully recommended."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So I started CrossFit and quickly found my standard hanes boxers were a no-go. They'd rip in a deep squat, they would bunch up very fast (choking my thighs, bunching up on my butt only getting tighter in the front and baggier in the back as I progressed) and I started looking on some online CrossFit communities for a better option. Enter these boxer briefs... while I never thought I'd pay 20$ for a single pair of underwear... they are well worth every cent. They give, they breathe, they are snug but not uncomfortable. I also purchased a similar product made by Adidas and love them both equally. Both are now part of my regular fitness gear."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I can't add much to the overwhelmingly positive reviews. These are the most comfortable underwear, quickest drying, stay dry, easy to clean, least smelling pairs I've had.They would actually make a great gift because a lot of guys probably will not spend this much for a pair, although I am just mad I didn't sooner. But because of that, think about it. The packaging is nice also and gives a lot of info on why they are so great. So treat yourself or someone who deserves a great item."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are expensive but the quality is great and the fit is athletic without being restrictive.  I needed underwear for what they are designed for: washing in a hotel sink and throwing over a shower rod.  They dry super fast (few hours usually if hung in ample air circulation.  They are very comfortable, don't get damp.  The fit is a bit loose but in the right way: not dumpy and keep things where they are supposed to stay. Unlike cotton shirts, they don't wrinkle or look hammered after frequent use."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've been trying tons of underwear over the years not really happy with any for whatever reason. These are hands down the best. Spend the extra $$ theyre super comfortable, will last forever, you can hand wash and they dry in no time (you can wring them out and put them on within 2 mins of washing and your body will totally dry them the rest of the way fast. Could maybe use a button or more front overlap of the flaps but no big deal. I bought one pair then bought 3 more, will never wear anything else."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are definitely some of the most comfortable boxers I've ever worn. That being said, I am not comfortable wearing these in a day-to-day capacity. For hiking and the like, these are great. But I've found they can move around and cause a little chaffing if I wear them during my desk job which is odd, but the truth. These also run quite a bit larger than other boxer briefs, my medium size is almost baggy. Compared to my adidas climalite boxer briefs, which are quite tight, I can feel like I'm swimming in these. If I purchase another pair, I'll definitely be sizing down."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Worth every penny, especially if you wait for them to go on sale.  Try one pair to start, because they may not be your thing, but I find they give slight support and chaffing protection both while wearing slacks and blue jeans.  The waist band of many other brands has been a problem for me in the past, but these have given me only minor comfort issues, usually revolving around the rise of my slacks or jeans coupled with my belt while sitting down.  The only way to avoid this completely is to have them painted on I think.  Have not tested their extreme adventure utility yet, but they have served me well on a trip back home to see the parents, and the packability made them easy to get into a crowded carry on."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Im very happy with my order and I wear these more than any other kind of mens boxer briefs. I bought two pair and will buy more. They are very comfortable, light weight but also snug. They hold up in all the right parts. They also have triple stitching around the waist band which other brands don't have and tend to rip after a few wears. These hold up great around the waist due to the way their sewn in the waist. I do not dry these in a dryer with heat after wash, I have found that they keep their color and newness longer that way. I recommend these boxer briefs above all othersThe company is great too, the seller replaced a missing pair that was never delivered to me or lost in the mail without any problems. So I highly recommend them."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "So, purchase a pair of these because I was sick of the 'Hanes' and 'Fruit of the Loom' pairs riding up, sweating through them, and loosing elastic so quickly.  And these are an improvement over the 'typical underwear'.  However, I did also purchase \"Champion Elite Active Fit Boxer Brief 3 Pack No Ride up\", and these fit and wear so much better.  For the money, the Champion Elite is much better!  The ExOfficio still 'rides up', and picking wedges is umcomfortable and embarrassing!  Maybe a small would fit me better?  Not sure, I am a 34 waist and the sizing guideline said to go with a medium.  Not willing to drop another $20 to try the small.......  The material feels nice - smooth and soft.Overall the Champion Elite are a better choice in my opinion, no ride up, and cheaper per pair."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I have been on a long hunt for comfortable underwear. I hate cotton shorts that stretch all out during every wear. I like the compression shorts that keep their fit but I am always having to pull the legs back down as they ride up from repeated sitting and standing. These shorts are not a tight fitting compression short, but they are slightly snug fitting and not baggy, but the fabric is so slick and comfortable. They keep their shape all day long, and the legs do not ride up and get stuck. I really like them and will be ordering more soon."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I feel silly reviewing underwear, but there you go... this product deserves the praise.  I used to wear cotton knit boxers all the time, but I got tired of them riding up (and having to pull them out of my crotch all the time, causing embarrassing scenes) and getting hot and muggy down there due to the cotton material.  Enter the Give-N-Go Boxer Briefs!They ride in place, no riding up.  They stretch and conform to shape comfortably.  They do NOT hold moisture or odor.  Yes, the price is a bit steep for underwear, and I initially only bought two pairs.  After wearing them for a few days, I immediately ordered five more.  Now I've got one for each day of the week!  :-)"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Works as advertised, comfortable, quick drying with minimal care.  The material is very stretchy so it moves with your body during activities.  They pack small and light so you can take a few with you during travel; although you won't need many as they are easy to handwash and quick to dry.One of my favorite items offered by Exofficio.Normally, I use the boxer briefs only for travel but am slowly working them into everyday rotation.  I just need to buy more.The only downsides are that colors limited and the boxer briefs can get expensive.  However, prices are known to drop from time to time so wait and get them when they are 45-50% off the $30 MSRP."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Underwear seems to be one of the more individualistic and difficult products for a man to buy.  I had been using a Fruit Of The Loom model of Boxer Briefs for years but when it came time to replace then they were no longer available.  I have tried at least 5 different brands and these seem to be the best fit for me.  Even though (I think) I have a 31 inch waist I ordered a size small and the fit is perfect for my body.  The legs are snug and the waist is just right.  The fabric is very soft and a little sheer but it seems to hold up well.  The legs never stretch out - I tried wearing them on a recent trip to Asia (24 hours door to door) and they never lost their shape plus they were extremely comfortable.  The bottom line is I have found my new brand and model of Boxer Briefs = so far I've bought 22 pair :-) but then again I'm a little OCD."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These underwear are absolutely the best!  I have tried a number of athletic boxer briefs, but these are my favorite.  They stay cool and dry in our hot AZ summers.  They breath well and don't turn into a swamp.  They are comfortable and fit great.  I have a 32\" waist and the small fits great.  The elastic does not roll like some of my Champion boxer briefs and there is minimal bunching or riding up.  I just wish they were a little cheaper, but they are worth it.  I buy a couple at a time until I can phase out my old boxer briefs.  Try a pair and you will never want to wear anything else."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are, by far, the best underwear on the planet. They stretch and breathe better than anything Under Armour or Nike make. You can wash them in a sink, and they dry in a few hours. They are also very, very resistant to any odor accumulation.They are almost indestructible. I've had a couple of pairs for a few years, which I workout in every day. I stretch and squat with them, which normal cotton underwear just ripped after a couple of months. They are also more comfortable because they do stretch so easily.They're expensive, but they're worth it."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "definitely the best underwear I have ever owned. I have tried soooooo many different styles and pairs. I have been hunting for the perfect fit, comfortable waist, something that doesn't ride up the back or the crotch, gives adequate cup support and is ventilated.  This might be the miracle undergarment.  Plus, they actually do dry quickly. I travel light and have actually washed them in the sink. By morning . . . . clean and dry! These have replaced my everyday wear. I don't wear these to the gym, as I prefer something with even more cup support, but for a light workout, these would be great."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "While I can't comment on the washing/drying of this item because I strictly wash with regular laundry, I found myself disappointed on the support of the 'main compartment' with these.  They did get the leg support right, and I did not find that wearing these caused any ride ups throughout the day, but beyond that am not impressed.  I tried out the UA Boxerjock and it seems to be the opposite, where the central chamber provides great support but the legs ride up regularly.With that said, I can't recommend these because of the lack of support for the cost of the boxer briefs."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "these fit great.  I am 5'6&#34; 180.  problem is i wore them 3 or 4 times and two random spots started to &#34;pill up&#34;  one spot on my right &#34;cheek&#34; and the other on my left thigh.  i wore them to a normal job for about 6 hours. normal dress pants.  Amazon sent me a new pair.  will update after a couple weeks of wear and see what happens with new ones.  I really want these to work out, they fit feel great."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I've got to say, I never thought as a jeans and work-shirt kind of a guy I'd get all excited about some new underwear, but here I am writing a glowing review!These are the best undershorts ever!I've been a Fruit-of-the-loom kind of a guy for 50 years.  Saw these as a lightning Deal and bought four pair.  Now these are my go-to shorts!  Spendy?  Yup, but worth every penny.  Fast washing and drying.  Can sink-wash them and hang them over the shower-rod and they will be completely dry by morning.  Super comfortable, great waistband.I like these so much, I've added them to my wishlist too!"}
{"label": 8, "raw": "These are the most comfortable pair of boxer briefs I've ever worn.  I have a 30\" waist so I went with the medium, though I could have easily gone small.  Very roomy and appear to be durable.  I'm sure hand washing will extend the life twofold at the very least.  I'd also like to mention that ExOfficio's athletic clothing, shirts, these boxers, etc all dry in amazing time.  They will dry in less than a half hour indoors and around 5 minutes or less outside in warm weather- most likely less time in direct sunlight on a hot day."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Recently purchased this product, and I am satisfied withe the quality of this product. Here's a break down of the pros and cons. One of the best pairs of brief I own and I would say it's arguably better than most Calvin Klein briefs and other competitors.Pros:-Highly comfortable-Durable material-Material maintains it's consistency, shape, and tightness. Doesn't loosen after washing or change in any way.-Quick-drying-Length is perfect-Waist band is comfortable doesn't squeeze or irritate at all.-Smooth durable materialCons:- If there is any, you could argue the price for one pair is a bit high, that's for you to decide.Conclusion: I certainly recommend this product, it's just a very well made product. This product does stand out, it's not like the other products."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Seriously, a review on underwear? But these really are worth it. I took three pair of these with me on an 800-mile walk of California's El Camino Real this Spring. While I did not attempt wearing them for multiple days without washing, they were extremely comfortable and the snug-but-not-tight legs seemed to prevent any chafing. Being nylon, they could be hand washed at night, rolled tightly in a towel and then left flat to dry overnight. These are now my standard choice instead of cotton boxers, which get damp and clammy in hot weather. These feel much better."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Shoe tree is well shaped, wood quality is excellent, spring tension is just right for the size (my large size trees fit everything from 10-11.5), and fit and finish is great for the price. Bottom line? Spending an extra 20 bucks to keep your shoes looking and smelling good (and making them last longer) is a no brainer. Go for it, you'll be glad you did.I think this is a well-known tip but I'll throw it out there anyway; sand your trees once in a while to expose new cedar to make sure it continues to work like new."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Definitely high quality. These shoe trees sell as a pair. Two in the box.Spring loaded with a split instep. Force them into the toe of your boot/shoe and push the heel home. The instep widens to mold to the shape of the instep and toe of your footwear and the spring mechanism pushes back against the heel.These trees will break your toughest footwear in within a week.Perfect form and fit, very functional and priced right.I feel safe claiming the mechanics and the form will last a lifetime.I'm very happy with my purchase."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "Take care of it. I've never had a shoe tree before. It's awesome. As time passes my feet have gotten wider. This means my long time shoes need a little help ( I  have a bunion on one foot) for me to keep enjoying them. These Woodlore  Adjustable Shoe Trees seem to be made well, especially compared to a plastic counterpart. It makes cleaning and appreciating my shoes easier, plus the cedar helps shoes smell good.  I've already bought another shoe tree for a pair of lovely boots. Take care of your shoes so they take care of you."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "I love this shoe tree. It is made of cedar wood, it has a nice fragrance to it. I also have found an additional use to using this shoe tree. I have a couple of pairs of shoes that are a tad bit smaller for my foot size. When I put this shoe tree in it, it expands the shoes a bit and these smaller shoes become a lot more comfortable to wear. My suggestion is if you wear a shoe size of 9 or 9.5 buy the 10-11 size. You can squeeze it in and it fills the front of the shoe well.I would recommend this all who wear leather shoes, you need to give them a day's rest with these shoe trees."}
{"label": 8, "raw": "First impression out of the package - a really awful smell.  Maybe that's the cedar part, I don't know.  At any rate, it does what it's supposed to - maintain the shape of the shoe, though the springs seem fairly weak.  I'll try and say more about it after some time goes by.I've had it a while yet; now I can say that the straps are too small and too scrawny, and hard to use to remove or insert the shoe trees.  I'd greatly prefer a real handle."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A clasically-styled and introverted album, Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.  Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely, quiet voice.  But within every introvert is an inferno, and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.If you've never heard Enya before, you might want to start with one of her more popularized works, like Watermark, just to play it safe.  But if you're already a fan, then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the third review of an irish album I write today (the others were Cranberries) and now I'm sure about that Ireland is one of the countries producing the best music in the world. And not just commercial pop-music in the Spice Girls way. Okay, I just wanted to say something about Irish  music. Now let's say something about this album. It's great. it's  beautiful. Very good, easy listened music. If you like Enya or you just  want some easy-listened relaxing music. This is the album for you to buy!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is not another lousy Celtic New Age album - it is a genuine piece of music, well written and performed with emotion. It never fails to send shivers up and down my spine for some reason... Ever since I heard Orinoco Flow Enya has cast her spell on me. She is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic. On this album every song is as perfect as it can get on a pop record, with melodies that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain. I have every Enya album to date, but this one seems to be particularly special. A must for any music lover!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "[One CD, with a running time of 44 minutes.] Ah...this wonderful CD shows off Enya's silky smooth voice. The eleven tunes are hauntingly beautiful. I won't try to categorize her music, it is simply too rich and complex.The paperwork includes the words to ten of the songs (The Memory of Trees is a musical number), and two nice color pictures of Enya. (I love extras!) So, if you like Enya's past hits, then I think that you will like this one as well. Buy it!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "(...)She is one of a kind, and this album only enhances her contribution to musical enjoyment. As always, the instrumental opening sets a mood, followed by the lively \"Anywhere Is\", a song which grew on me each time I listened. Each song is exquisite, but for me, \"China Roses\" is the most delicately crafted song. However, \"Once You Had Gold\" which isn't mentioned as much is another of the highpoints. \"On My Way Home\" is a fitting conclusion to the album. I have heard rumors that not everybody likes Enya, and if there is a person who doesn't like her, then he or she shouldn't get this CD, but for everybody else, this is one of the essential CD's for your collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This,is the type(and caliber)of album that is(sadly)missing,from todays(pathetic)music scene!!\"Foolin'Around\"became an INSTANT classic,\"Good Thing\"is a painfully TRUE,song,and \"All is not gone\"is a beautiful,HOPE-instilling track!!

{"label": 9, "raw": "This album was released during an era where slow jams were in and giving up-tempo R&B flavor a try was also in. Like many of their counterparts during that time, the pretty ladies of Changing Faces needed to realize their strength in ballads and avoided trying any up-tempo material. However, there are a couple of good tunes on this album, particularly the slow jam, \"All Is Not Gone\", where sorrow and regret serves as a theme for a song that was definitely written with the intent of winning over ones with heartbreaks in their history. R. Kelly-produced hit \"Stroke You Up\" was a radio smash, but the lyrics weren't exactly poetic or articulate. But, it's still a popular track that may bring back some old school nostalgia for some of you."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Many bands have a long time to perfect the songs for their first album resulting in a solid debut. This may be the case for The Cars (although Candy-O is great too). This album contains classic songs like Just What I Needed, You're All I've Got Tonight, Bye Bye Love, and Moving In Stereo. It's a crime that this band never got the credit they deserved. They created catchy, sometimes quirky, rock songs with a good balance between rockin guitar and cool keyboards. Elliot Easton's guitar playing is superb as he always plays for the song and not just to show-off. The vocal phrasing of Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr (rest in peace) is excellent (even if I didn't always understand the lyrics). A classic album that must never be forgotten!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "What can I say about the Cars first album. The Cars debut album has to be one of the most impressive albums that I have ever heard. Why can't bands make albums this great anymore? Three big hit singles \"Good Times Roll\",\"Just What I Needed\", and \"My Bestfriend's Girl\". As well as \"Bye, Bye Love\", \"Moving in Stereo\", and \"YOu're All I've Got Tonight\" that each get a lot of radio play as well. This is one of those rare albums that is great from start to finish, no filler here."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The Cars was one of the most original bands to come out of the late 70s/early 80s, a band that helped set the yardstick for New Wave. This was their first album, coming out in 1978, and is in my humble opinion to be the best album that the band cut. Just about all of its tracks are great, and not just the hits \"Just What I Needed,\" \"My Best Friend's Girl\" and \"Good Times Roll.\"If you are a fan of New Wave music, then you will love this album. Heck, even if is just that you fondly remember the music of the late 70s/early 80s, then you will love this album, too. Do yourself a favor, and buy this album!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's ridiculous how many bands nowadays blatantly rip off the Cars without anyone calling them on their crap.  \"Stacy's Mom,\" anyone?  Weezer or Hot Hot Heat, perhaps?The reason for all of this idolatry is, of course, because the Cars' debut album is still one of the freshest and most vital pop albums ever.  The record was released in 1978, and it never ceases to amaze me with just how timelessly perfect it still sounds.With simple, catchy, and infinitely memorable songs, the Cars' debut is the official soundtrack to a good time.  Easily one of the 70s' best.  \"Just What I Needed\" is among my top five favorite pop songs ever."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "the cars released this great record back in 1978.shortly after it,s release it was all over the airwaves.this album is in my opinion another one of the finest debut albums in rock ever!!there are so many great songs on this album it may well be the cars quintessential album. ric ocasek ;rythm guitarist and chief song writer for the cars was in top form on this album.for me the best cuts are[and there are many!]you,re all i,ve got tonight,good times roll,bye,bye,love,moving in stereo,just what i needed,my best friend,s girl,all mixed up and don,t cha stop.i realize i have just named most of the tunes on this album but i think this album is a must for any cars fan new or old!i also love the cover that chick with the sexy red lips!!this album and their second album candy o from 1979 are two of the best albums the cars ever did!"}

The 'best of' they did  covers the hits, but this CD, from start to finish, is a work of new-wave  art - rarely matched by their contemporaries (except maybe the 1st  Pretenders album...).They (The Cars) brought cynicism to a new level,  without being obsessed with anger/etc.  This CD has an underlying power to  it that is unmatched by others - one that will remain as a CD that listened  today (20 years on) for a reason beyond their sheer popularity."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The Cars' self-titled debut album, which introduced the band's unique blend of the Velvet Underground, the Steve Miller Band, and Roxy Music, is their most balanced album as far as vocals are concerned, with lead vocals about equally split between Ben Orr (R.I.P.) and Ric Ocasek. Orr's vocals are more melodic than Ocasek's, as the latter seems to have some vocal tics that can be annoying at times. This wasn't a problem on the first two albums or HEARTBEAT CITY, as these records have enough hooks to compensate for any vocal shortcomings that the bandmembers might have had, but it was a severe issue on PANORAMA. If you're hoping for a Cars reunion, sadly, it will never happen; bassist/vocalist Ben Orr died of pancreatic cancer in 2000."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "This album was originally released on and is still distributed by Capitol Records. Capitol's original catalog number is DT 2458 for the stereo LP and T 2458 for the mono LP. The stereo copies were \"duophonic\",meaning they could only be played on stereo phonographs for maximum sound quality. But then again,you'd get good quality sound if you played a duophonic copy on a monaural phonograph. Stereo LP copies of THE BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS were \"duophonic\" also. Hits from this album include SLOOP JOHN B.,GOD ONLY KNOWS and WOULDN'T IT BE NICE?. This album was a best-seller when it was released in 1966. The Beach Boys were still in their teen idol phase then as was their Capitol labelmates,The Beatles and Peter & Gordon. Also then,Brian Wilson began to have problems with drugs. He'd remain with the band in the studio but turned his duties on the stage to Bruce Johnston. All the other songs are good."}

From the youthful abandonment of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" to the dramatism present on \"Sloop John B.\" to the heartugging \"God Only Knows\" (voted the greatest love song of all time) to the poignancy of \"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\" to the chilling \"Caroline No\", there is not one clunker on the whole cd.This newly remastered edition features the entire album in both stereo and mono. In both forms, the album sounds absolutely fantastic. There ies also an excellent booklet filled with some great essays and rare pcitures. Definitey a must have album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am very disapointed! After looking for this album for 10 years, at least I bought it and ... masterpiece?C'mon people! I have around 2000 Rock albums in my collection and I would never placed this not even between the top 100.How could anyone say that Rubber Soul or Revolver are under Pet Sounds? Any 60's Rolling Stone album is one hundred times better. And something else, if this is the sound that shape the American pop music, I might be wrong, but ... where is Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters, Miles Davis, etc? Those are really masters of American music, not The Beach Boys.I can't give to this album more than half star."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Pet Sounds  being The Beach Boys 11th studio album and their 1966 release and singles released on the album were \"Caroline No\", \"Wouldn't it be nice\", \"Sloop John B\" and \"God Only Knows\". Yes it is a good album, however to compare it with \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" does not work for me as I consider Beatles to be far superior. Even Rolling Stones has made better albums then this. However, do not get me wrong this is a good album, but not as good as many would have you believe. The booklet is very nice with many photographs, liner notes written by Brian Wilson and David Leaf. No lyrics are included but we get a list of whom plays what on each track. 4/5."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "What is the big deal? Wouldn't it be nice and Caroline no are great songs. There's 3 more good songs and a nice instrumental and the rest is filler. Sure, its great for a Beach Boys album but in the great universe of music this is just a really good pop album.I suppose if I'd never heard jazz or classical music I too would think that Brian's use of vibraphone and glockenspiel was some sign of genius. And if I'd never heard the Platters, the Lettermen or Manhattan Transfer I too would think that the Beach Boys were a great vocal band. Brian brought a good sense of vocal and instrumental arrangement together with some good material to create a pop record that had more depth than most at the time of its release. Just keeping it real."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am not a Beach Boys fan.I consider this one of the 4 or 5 greatest albums of all time.The trouble with this album is that it constantly points out the musical genius--and I do mean genius--Brian Wilson was, and leaves you wondering how he could have plummeted to the depths that would hit him within just a few months of PET SOUNDS.As much as I love &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B,&quot; they seem second tier when heard in the context of this album.  &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day,&quot; &quot;Here Today,&quot; &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; and &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; are all first rate Pop.PET SOUNDS also has what I consider to be the greatest Beach Boys track, &quot;Caroline No.&quot;  It is a perfect recording of a heartbreaking lyric."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Undeniably the Beach Boys masterpiece. This is an album that has transcended the years and will still be played and enjoyed hundreds of years from now. Brian Wilson, inspired by The Beatles &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album, set to work, along with some help from Tony Asher to create one of the most amazing pop records ever made. The digital remastering is excellent,...these songs sound wonderful. And the 24 page book is great. Includes notes by Brian Wilson, loads of photos, track-by-track notes, and a 6 page essay by David Leaf on The Beach Boys and the making of this album. My version has 3 bonus tracks &quot;Unreleased Backgrounds&quot;, &quot;Hang on to Your Ego&quot; and &quot;Trombone Dixie&quot;. This album belongs in all good music collections."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No question, one of wonders of the digital is the chance for a work like this to be remixed in stereo, with an amazing soundstage.  Mark Linett deserves an award for the work he did with the multi-tracks to this album.  I've heard things I've never heard in the hundred times I've listened to  the mono Pet Sounds.  Putting the mono and stereo versions back to back  really shows the aural difference.For all that refuse to accept the  stero version and consider it some sort of sacrelige, hey, you have the  mono version.  But you are really depriving yourself.This classic got a  whole lot better.  For those of you that are Beatles fans as well, we can  only dream of the Beatles work getting the same treatment."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Pet Sounds is one of those albums that you just sit and listen to and say &quot;My God, these guys were truly amazing&quot;.  Brian Wilson was so far ahead of his time in regards to songwriting.  I don't however recommend this album to everyone.  This album is not &quot;packed&quot; with hits, but it is far better than most anything you would buy today.  If you are looking for a more radio friendly BBalbum, go with the greatest hits Vol. 1. But if you have a little extra cash, but this and see why so many contemporary artists believe that this is one of the best albums ever made."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "One of the truly hyped albums of all time that lives up to the lavish praise heaped upon it. Brian Wilson was a 23-year-old who was struggling to express himself in new aural forms, and made this masterwork. Somewhat surprisingly, it flopped. The liner notes detail the reasons: kitsch cover (no doubt), automatic dislike of anything &quot;Beach Boys&quot; by those that would have liked it the most - hippies. It also paints Brian in a glowing light as working alone, without a songwriting partner like the Lennon/McCartney team, or without a guiding producer like George Martin. That he was such a young man working alone, against the advice of his manager, and created such a beautiful album is truly a testament to his musical genius. The songs speak for themselves, and everyone should know them by heart."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I love the Beach Boys as much as anyone.  Let me say that again.  I love the BEACH Boys as much as anyone.  By that I mean I love the Beach Boys who actually live up to their name, singing about the beach, girls, surfing, cars, and Rhonda.This is not the Beach Boys.  It can't be.  Why?  No beach songs!  I thought it was some kind of joke.  All &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes, backed by elevator music.  There's barely any Mike Love on the album at all.Way overrated."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I get something different out of this CD every time I hear it -- for me, the mark of an outstanding record.When something new STILL pops out of the speakers after three years of listening.....well, I know I'm hearing one of the all-time greats.I get the most out of PET SOUNDS on headphones.  Take a walk on the beach at dusk with this CD at medium volume, so you can hear the music interspersed with the crash of the surf and the cries of seagulls.  The music fits right in.  Brian Wilson absolutely captures the outdoor beauty of Southern California in 13 heavenly songs.I won't get into the SGT. PEPPER - PET SOUNDS debate.  They're both masterpieces.  Let's just say both bands pushed each other to new levels of aural beauty -- a &quot;race&quot; that ultimately drove Wilson into seclusion.  One of pop music's finest."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "There is nothing that I can say about this album that hasn't already been said.. But I would like to express my profound moment of discovery when I first listened to it.. I had the preconception that the Beach boys were just a bunch of dumb surfers.. My musical tastes leaned towards jazz, classical, and more progressive rock.. But I kept on seeing this album on lists of the greatest albums of all time so.. I gave it a try. I wasn't prepared for the beauty of this perfect musical mixture of sounds and moods.. It was clearly a very personal record that expressed many feelings I had at the time.. the production is brilliant.. being a big fan of the beatles I immediately heard simmilarities between George Martinand Sgnt Pepper and how they must have been influenced by this record.. This is not surfer music - it is much more.."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The merits of this album need not be discussed here. Pet Sounds has been widely regarded as a pop classic for over forty years and its popularity shows no sign of letting up. What does need addressing, however, is the sound Capitol has achieved in rendering this recording in Mono on CD.The remastering game that has been going on for the past decade has yielded mixed results. Record companies promising superior sound have come up short more than half the time when it comes to reissuing classics. Lucky for us, that's hardly the case with this reissue of the Beach Boys' finest hour.Pet Sounds in Mono is what every fan hopes for when plunking down hard earned cash for an album he already owns. The sound is incredibly warm with every instrument coming through distinctly. The harmonies coalesce in a way you simply don't hear on a stereo mix. And the immediacy is impressive."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is possibly one of my favourite albums - period. The melodies beautiful, the harmony, arrangements.etc were well beyond their time. For a record released in 1966, it sounds amazing on CD. A far superior album to either Sgt. Pepper's and a bit better than Rubber Soul, there are only a couple of songs I don't really like. A tiny gripe I have with the album the melodies on songs such as Do you still believe me are a bit repetitive. Although nonetheless very good. Btw the song 'God Only Knows' is often cited as the album's best but personally I would rank it about 3rd or 4th on the album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Not as good as the Getz/Gilberto album (how many albums are?) recorded two years later, but it is a very enjoyable effort by saxman Getz and guitarist Charlie Byrd. Unlike the Getz/Gilberto record, this one has no vocals. It's a short and sweet instrumental effort without a note wasted or misplaced. Desafinado (\"Out of Tune\") and Samba de Uma Nota So (\"One Note Samba\") are the standouts. The album is expensive considering the 35 minute playing time, but you will listen to it many times, trust me."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the album that kicked off the bossa nova craze in the US over 40 years ago.  In the hands of lesser musicians this style could degenerate into lightweight cocktail music, but not here.  Stan Getz's feathery, soft saxophone playing weaves beautiful melodies over the swaying, dancing Brazilian rhythms.  Charlie Byrd's is terrific on the acoustic guitar and the tunes will get stuck in your head after 3 spins or less.  The only possible complaint is the short playing time -- a mere 35 minutes.This recording isn't as well-known as Getz/Gilberto but is just as essential.  If you like Getz's playing, be sure to get some of his other, non-bossa-nova recordings as well.  (One more caveat: those looking for more vocals by Astrud or Joao Gilberto will be disappointed -- this CD is entirely instrumental.)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's my first CD bought from Amazon and it's one of the best albums of Patti. Different styles but a unique big voice! Hear her Aretha's voice in the track 5, for example! Track 1 is a new version of the first song in her album \"Havana Candy\".  Track 2 shows us her \"Ability To Swing\". Tracks 3-4-10 are beautiful ballads. Track 6 is the reggae one. Tracks 7-8 have a sweet sound. Track 9 is my favourite of the album, in a gospel style."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A blessed union of amazing vocals and outstanding studio musicians make Patti Austin's THAT SECRET PLACE a dazzling achievement.Whether it's jazz or pop, R&B; or gospel, reggae or funk, Austin impeccably delivers a true command of whatever style she tackles.  In this 1994 release, each track allows Patti to effortlessly glide through each song with her penetrating performances.She cooks on tunes like ABILITY TO SWING, a scat-infused invitation to dance , her cover of Aretha's classic ROCK STEADY and the euphoric drive of REACH.  Have fun with her reggae-flavored CAPTIVATED.  Then let your heart melt with SOMEBODY MAKE ME LAUGH, BROKEN DREAMS or the gorgeous STARS IN YOUR EYES.  The album is flawlessly produced by jazz icons Lee Ritenour and Dave Grusin.Patti has certainly deserved wider success in her career, but for those who have wisely followed her know what a treasure she is!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Listening to this album, it's very difficult to realise that she is only 18. She plays the fiddle with a skill way beyond her years, and her delicate soprano voice sings of lost love and heartbreak with such emotion and beauty that touches the heart of anyone who has experienced love gone wrong. This album was just a hint of what was to come, and I had the pleasure of seeing her in concert a few years back, in Toronto. This is Bluegrass at its best. Buy it, you'll love it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I must admit this CD was in my shopping cart for quite a while given its genre.  I finally make the plunge when I needed it for free shipping and the first time I played it, I couldn't believe the beautiful purity and fullness of her voice.The music is very interesting also since it is obviuosly country, but these are real talented musicians and the arrangements are incredibly performed and make a country band  really kick-[...] in a cross over jazzy sense in a couple of tunes where you'd never guess this is a band that plays bluegrass.It's worth every one of those stars and one more if they had it.By the way, I found out that the ladies like this CD very much."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I'm not sure how this woman would be classified... I guess it's generally country music, with a hint of bluegrass.  But in certain songs, I also detected some gospel influence.  Note that I have NEVER been a country music lover.  My taste in music is very wide - West African, Brazilian, Greek, electronica, soul/funk, classic rock.  I saw Alison performing on public TV a few weeks ago, and was just blown away - so much so that I went out to buy the CD.Almost every track is wonderful in its own right.  Alison's voice is so beautiful, but I think it's the combination of all the talents on this CD that makes it so wonderful.  The song-writing is excellent, and the banjo pickin' is also.I'm so glad to have discovered her, and to now have this CD in my collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I've long been a fan of Alison Krauss and her band, Union Station.  Their brand of contemporary bluegrass is unique and captivating.  This album is their best work to date. Superb quality throughout, including the  instrumentals. The title track is irresistable, and &quot;There is a  Reason&quot; is rapturous. Impeccable musicianship and superb recording,  along with Krauss's unique vocal style and virtuoso fiddle playing combine  to make this CD a must-have for fans of bluegrass. In a word, masterful."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Generally speaking, you could say that there two sides to Alison Krauss and Union Station. The softer melodic side is usually with Alison vocally in front, and the faster bluegrass/country side which often has one of the band members on lead vocals.Though I usually prefer the Alison songs, this two-sides concept gives a fine variation and the fast bluegrass tracks demonstrate what great musicians the Union Station are.Among Alison's songs, which are all great, for me the beautiful pop ballad \"Happiness\" stand out, which also has great harmony vocals by banjoplayer Ron  Block.With at least a handful other great pop/country ballads written by various songwriters like Michael McDonald and Mark Simos this is one of my favourite albums by the group."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Call the lyrics dumb all you want, they are more interesting than 1,000 bands trying to search their lost soul.  News Flash:  There is no such thing as a soul.  Keep looking for love and UFO's and let us know your fascination with modern life.  I love the guitar sound and the hooks make your albums the best.  This and #2 are the classics.  What happened to make you so dull after that.  \"Remember David\" was one of your best songs and \"Suicide Day\" was good, but the rest of the third album, even the tile track was boring.  Two classics ain't bad.  Get this one right away."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a classic cd, period.  KRS-1 is a living legend, and this is him at his prime.  Songs like \"My Philosophy,\" \"Illegal Business,\" \"Stop the Violence,\" and \"Still #1\" are some of the most quoted/sampled in the last 20 years of hip hop.  If you think you don't know anything by KRS-1, one listen of this cd would prove you wrong  The list of rappers who have sampled or quoted songs on this cd is inexhaustible.  This was big when it came out in 88, and it sounds just as fresh today.  This is a gem among diamonds, a true hip hop classic. Even in Scott La Rock's absence, the production is stellar.  The lyrics are top-notch.  As close to a perfect hip-hop record as possible."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is why I still listen to KRS-1 today!  If I saw this CD in the stores, I would get it.  Lots of intelligent and conscious lyrics and he doesn't hold back. I like &quot;Stop the Violence&quot; and its rumbling sound.  I still like &quot;My Philosophy&quot;, &quot;I'm Still #1&quot;, &quot;Jimmy&quot; and many others.  But I like on &quot;Illegal Business&quot; where they sample some music that I remembered hearing on Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, Bill Cosby's show.  He mentions his friend Scott La Rock many times over the album.  This is his best effort to me. While I like his later ones, this is the best!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "FRESH!  FOR 1988, you SUCKERS!!!How many people can forget that line?  If you don't know it, you don't have the album!  So what are you waiting for?  Buy it!Best Tracks:  &quot;My Philosophy&quot;, &quot;I'm Still  #1&quot;, &quot;Illegal Business&quot;; and the most HARD ROCKING track  is:&quot;YA SLIPPIN&quot;, which hijacks Deep Purple's &quot;Smoke on  the Water&quot; guitar riff and turns it into a hardcore hip-hop battle  rampage.Krs does a nod to spoken word poetry at the end, a first for rap  albums...&quot;See how it sounds, a little un-rational, a lot of MC's  like to use the word 'dramatical'&quot;. CLASSIC MATERIAL, AN YA KNOW  IT!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Krs-One is another one of those MCs, on a SHORT list of them, whose second album COMPLETELY took the first. By All Means Necessary was EXCELLENT, as he, just like Public Enemy did in 88, brought a conscious and more political state of awareness to hip hop. This album represents Krs in his true form, and it shows on EVERY song. Here's the review:Album Highlights: EVERY song is worth a listen.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Mattere: Thumbs up. Other than Public Enemy, who else was coming this political in 88?Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: This was a great moment for hip hop music. Krs-One came back in 88 for this second album and he didn't disappoint. If hip hop was still like this today, it would be so much better. One can only hope. Overall, I strongly recommend this album to any fan of hip hop, if you're into politically charged hip hop."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Truth be known, I'd probably keep this over his \"Hits\" disc. I say that because three of his absolute best songs are here in their original form, and some of his other hits border on cheese. Plus there's other good stuff here too. \"Caribbean Queen (no more love on the run)\" was a huge hit, as was the ballad \"Suddenly\", and I think my favorite is easily \"Loverboy\". Plus this has the minor hit \"Mystery Lady\", and a decent cover of \"The Long And Winding Road\". That's over half the album, and the remaining four songs I'd call good filler. Any fan of 80's pop/soul should consider this a must own."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "After recording several critically acclaimed albums for the GTO and Epic labels that did not exactly set the world on fire, Billy Ocean signed with Jive Records and hooked up with producer Keith Diamond who masterminded this classic 1984 release that made Billy Ocean a true superstar. The uptempo dance numbers &#34;Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)&#34;, &#34;Lover Boy&#34; and &#34;Mystery Lady&#34; all became huge hits but the title track was and is one of the most gorgeous ballads of its time and one which you can still regularly hear on adult contemporary stations throughout the country."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Like 1984's SUDDENLY and 1986's LOVE ZONE,this album,released in February 1988,spawned four hits. They are the title track,the love ballads THE COLOR OF LOVE and HERE'S TO YOU,and the powerful-sounding GET OUTTA MY DREAMS GET INTO MY CAR. The other songs are good. I like STAND AND DELIVER also. I never saw the 1988 film starring Lou Diamond Phillips so I don't know if that song appeared in the film. The other songs are great. Billy Ocean put out a dozen hits in the five-year period in which this album and the two predecessors were released. After this album,Ocean would start slowing down recording. Two more hits followed this album,LICENSE TO CHILL and I SLEEP BETTER(IN SOMEONE ELSE'S BED) which appeared new on the GREATEST HITS album,released in 1989."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This Billy Ocean album is still one of my favorites!  For him to follow the very successful Love Zone album with this platinum album is an understatement.  The big hits were Get Out of My Dreams, The Colour of Love, and Tear Down These Walls, but they're no contest to my favorites here. They are the grooving Gun For Hire and the rumbling Pleasure.  Some other songs I like are Soon as You're Ready, Calypso Girl, and Because of You. But Gun is still strong today with that superb horn section, the danceable rhythms and other aspects. I played that song over and over on the tape in 1988!  One of 1988's best albums to be released in at a time when 1987 songs and albums were number one hits in May, June and the summer of '88."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Billy Ocean. Good old Billy Ocean! Yepp, this is how real pop music is supposed to sound like.It seems all his golden oldies have been included on this greatest hits album: \"When the going gets tough\", \"Loverboy\", \"Get out of my dreams\" and \"Carribean Queen\". And yes, \"License to chill\" is there, too. Plus some ballads, but I find them boring.It's a pity that this is a CD rather than a DVD, since the videoclips of this singer are extremely entertaining. I mean, one of them features Danny De Vito. Another shows Jabba the Hutt (!). Or was that Danny in disguise? Billy Ocean has always been a visual experience, not just your average pop singer. But sure, the music without the clips works just as well.Well, what more can I say?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The best thing about getting old classics, is that they are inexpensive and still worth the listen. I may be 23 but I'm very old-school and when growing up all I'd listen to is Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, etc. But who I loved most of all was listening to Billy Ocean. Takes me back to my happier years and having fun. There are a few tracks that I don't remember but they are still good, takes me back to the Miami Vice theme wearing white pants era."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "So one day im over at Enrique's, a haunt me billy used to be regulars at way back when, and billy comes up to me and says &quot; I've got this killer new song in my head, but i'm not sure if its gonna sell.&quot; so I ask him why not. &quot; well you see its more of a nonlinear dramatic lydia lunch type of tune rather than my usual schtick.&quot; Well right then I asked him to lay it on me, and knowing big Billy I moved back a little because that cat spits like a mofo when he sings. so afterwards I told him &quot; look man its a great tune but change the words &quot;get out of my subconscience and into my libido to get out of my dreams and int my car.&quot; well I think everyone knows what happened from there. I just have to say kiler song BO,and i'll keep the stool warm for you, oh and I'll also save you a seat."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This came out in the midst of a lot of negativity in hip hop which has since overtaken the genre. KRS-One did a good job here in denouncing racism both inside and outside of the black community, dealing with issues of identity (the homeless and ya strugglin-note the subtle swipe at Michael Jackson in the latter) and an all-star jam with the BDP crew (D-nice, Miss Melody, Sister Harmony, etc). Some excerpts from Stokely Carmichael (yes, THAT Stoke-shortly before his death) are quite enlightening.Sadly, Kris Parker's hold on the youth did not last much longer as gangster (c)rap went on to destroy the music, but that's another story. Get this and see how rap COULD have been."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Buddy Guy is one of the top blues guitar man.The others are Jimi Hendrix,Gary Moore,SRV... In my opinion,this cd is his best work.You must put this at cdplayer,and hear as loud as you can,so you'll be in tune with  one of the most energetic,consistent,emotional blues sets ever recorded.  Buddy's vocal tunes are sensually incendiary,with the combination of right  music choices,resulting this great album,with explosive interpretation of  Mustang Sally,and passionate in all other tracks. I really recomend this  'Dam'n right...',one of my best favorites in my collection"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is, by far, Too Short's best album.  The whole thing is full of his unique, laid back flow and Yay Area beats.  IN THE TRUNK and I AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A DOG are the best songs, epitomizing Short's lifestyle.  IN  THE TRUNK has the funkiest beat, and the bass...you get submerged in it.  The production on the whole album is tight and Short Dog lays it all out  for the world to see:  the Oaktown lifestyle.  He's an Oakland Vet and  wants everybody to know it.  This is a no compromise album and one of the  best in my collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have been listening to rap for a long time and no one can compete with Too $hort.  His Oaktown style is like no other.  When I listen to this record I am brought back to a certain time period inn a place the only Too $hort can emulate.  Too $hort brings classic raps of pimpin, slangin dope, and riding old school rides down the street.  It is the representation of an era that canont be reprodiced, the early 90's.  \"No Love From Oakland\" stands out showing the real Oaktown funky Ant Banks beats.  \"Something to Ride To\" features the Dangerous Crew and is one of my favorite tracks, with 11+ minutes of staight Oakland Ant Banks funkn beat, it just lets me smoke and ride on the city steets all day. COP IT IF U A PLAYER."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "so far, my fave tracks:1)Duck Down(sick,wicked drum beat.)2)Like a throttle(club banger. how could you not dance to this one ?)3)We In There- good loop.4)Build And Destroy- This song gives a black eye to The Poor Righteous Teachers AND X-Clan.(\"Too many teachers in the class spoil the school.After awhile you got blabberin' F***in fools.\")(\"What are you doing for yourself, Black Man,tryin' hard to be the original man? who?the first man with the first tan on the first land with the first clan?WHO GIVES A D*** ?!\")Sucker,Wack Or Booty M.C.'s Need NOT apply. Krs-One made that abundantly clear on this album.(\"I don't battle to win or lose i battle to ruin your whole career.\")old-school hip-hop with a message as well...what more can my ears ask for ? :D"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is the straight-up hardcore from beginning to end.  People  slept on this album when it came out, but they need to wake up and pick  this up, on the serious tip.The most fiery cuts:  Duck Down, Drug  Dealer, Sex &amp; Violence, Build &amp; Destroy.Most subversive track:  &quot;13 &amp; Good&quot;, a tale of statuatory rape with a twist  ending....Superb production values by KRS-1, Prince Paul, Pal Joey, and  others...This is the LAST album by KRS-1 recorded under the group  moniker BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTIONS.  Check for his subsequent solo releases:  RETURN OF THE BOOM BAP, KRS-ONE (self-titled), and I GOT NEXT...FRESH  FOR 1992, AND YA KNOW IT!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "These boys been doing they thing for what, 15 years now. I didnt know about this album until recently. I was very familiar with Ridin Dirty tho. I thought that that was there first album. Hearing this album that came out 3 years earlier impressed me even more. They laid down the groundwork for Southern hip hop that was based on Blues, Soul, and G Funk. This was back in the early 90's when Southern hip hop and West Coast were basically talking to each other both being heavily influenced off each other. These guys along with 8 ball & MJG, Triple Six, Outkast, Goodie Mobb, and the Geto Boys are the only groups that can be called Dirty South Legends."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "UGK&#65533;s first album is an undisputed Dirty South classic.  This duo, hailing from Texas, was one of the first dirty south groups that were not bass music to put it down (along with Geto Boys & Eightball & MJG).  UGK&#65533;s debut album is beyond great.  The samples used in the songs are not disgraceful and UGK are notorious for sampling on their earlier albums.  The rapping, compared to their skills now, is a little lacking but they were in their developmental stages during this album.  Still, they drop memorable lines and classic verses all throughout this album.  The best songs include but are not limited to &#65533;Something Good&#65533;, &#65533;Use Me Up&#65533;, and  &#65533;Cramping My Style&#65533;.  This album is a must have for all fans of UGK and of Dirty South music.  5 Star classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album was haaard. The production is classic. Every song from the start to finish has tight rhymes. Spices flow was much more advanced from his first album which is a classic too. I can't sat how much I like this CD. I like what ant banks did with the 'george duke' sample on 'clip & tha trigga' too, since I used to like the original. This is essential if you want good westcoast rap.

{"label": 9, "raw": "This is probably the best solo album KRS-One has ever put out. Sorry to say there are probably other good ones, but this is the best put together one. The beats, the rhymes, and the material go together very nicely. My favorites are Outta Here, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound of Da Police, Uh Oh, Return of the Boom Bap, and Stop Frontin'. But the other songs are good too. I recommend this to fans of Boogie Down Productions or Hip Hop in general."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Boogie Down Productions leader KRS-One's reputation began to slip in the early '90s, as he spent more time educating than performing. He hit back at his critics with the slamming Return of the Boom Bap, his first official solo release. Leaving behind the detailed production of the last BDP album Sex and Violence, Boom Bap returns the MC to the spare, gritty territory of Criminal Minded. KRS-One sounds reinvigorated, as well, spitting out his rhymes with fury and intelligence. Although the record isn't as didatic as Edutainment or Sex and Violence, KRS-One hasn't made his lyrics simplistic, nor has he abandoned his cutting, intelligent social commentary. The combination of hard, basic beats and exciting rhymes makes Rerturn of the Boom Bap a genuine comeback for KRS-One, one of the founding figures of modern hip-hop."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "return of the boom bap is a great classic. it's way up there with 93 til infinity by souls of mischief, a future without a past by leaders of the new school, one for all , ed o.g and da bulldogs first album and gang starr step in the arena. it's crafted beats on krs-one album is by the talented dj premier. it's lyrics is so great too. check out sound of the police and mad crew. this is a gifted classic. with it's old school, loud bass original lyrics. definately a must have for any true hip hop head."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have been a krs-one fan for a LONG time, and would have to say this is his best album.  Sound Of Da Police is completely off the hook, the lyrics are some of the best you'll come across.  Krs is one of the greatest rappers ever, and this album is a timeless underground classic.  This is REAL hip-hop, dont support what we hear on the radio these days, its all crap, listen to legends like krs-one and rakim.  Other good tracks are KRS-One Attacks and Return Of Da Boombap.Beats - 10/10Lyrics - 10/10Production - 10/10Originality - 10/10Final Note - 5 Mic Classic, one that all true rap/hip-hop fans have.

Do yourself a favor and PICK THIS UP!

Check out all his other albums, including the latest, I  GOT NEXT..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Criminal minded, by any means, return of the boom bap, krs one (self titled) are the best albums he ever did and made him the legend he is. On this particular album he displays his true lyricism such as metaphors,battle rap etc. This is definately far entertaining then previous releases such as sex and violence, edutainment, and ghetto music, those albums came off to preachy in my opinion and don't standout amongst his better efforts as I mentioned before. You can play the whole thing through, although in my opinion the only track I would skip is \"uh oh\" because it's a beatbox beat which get's annoying after awhile other then that this is a classic album in hip hop and a landmark in it's history."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Krs-One returned with a vengeance in 93, and dropped a CLASSIC in the form of Return Of The Boom Bap. This album, like every other Krs-One album, represents him in his truest form, always talking about something positive, claiming to be &quot;the teacher&quot; of hip hop, and saying things to leave you thinking. Here's the review:Album Highlights: Krs-One Attacks, Outta Here, Black Cop, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound Of Da Police, Mad Crew, and Return Of The Boom Bap.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: While NOT as strong as Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary, this is still Krs at his best. Today, he still remains one of the most influential MCs out there keeping his legacy alive. Overall, I recommend you pick up this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sh**!!! This album is off the hook! \"Outta Here\" has one of the best beats ive ever heard!! Thats on a real HIPHOP tip right there! KRS-One's voice is better than ever and his lyrics are ON POINT EVERY TRACK! KRS-One has kept it real out of most emcees out of all these years. You got to give him his repsect. This guy is a TRUE emcee and if you dont like him, then go listen to your wack azz 50 Cent album. The production on this album is pretty much what gives it its name. Grimey old school soundin hiphop beats. If you want TRUE hiphop, better get this now! Real stuff. All the songs are on point.My Top 5 Songs1.Outta Here (NICE!)2.Mortal Thought3.I Cant Wake Up4.Return Of The Boom Bap5.Stop Frontin"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "UGK, on their second album, finds the unstoppable riding groove that they are most known for today.  Bun B's rugged flow and menacing lyrics nicely offset Pimp C's playalistic style.  The beats are strictly playa beats that you can ride to or just chill and bob ya head to.  Never corny and always on point.  Pimp C is definitely an underated producer.  Every song bumps but the classics are `Return', It's Supposed To Bubble, I Left It Wet For You,  Feds In Town, and Front Back Side to Side.  This album, being nearly ten years old, does not have a dated sound and wouldn't sound out of wack on a mix cd of recent songs.  It would fit right in.  And that my friends is a sign of timeless classic music.  UGK - Supertight - 5 stars."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Pimp C and Bun B came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire.  This album slams from start to finish with that old school down south feel.  The beats are melodic G-Funk, with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs.  Lyrically and vocally, UGK kills in all departments.  They really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows. The track \"Feds in Town\" is a gangster classic with a phat, funky beat and tight scratches. \"Super Tight...\" is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue. The mid 90's was one of the best periods in rap history, and this album is testament to it.  Don't sleep on this classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Don't be too mad at me, but I really just discovered 12 Play about a few weeks ago.  I've really been 'into' music the past few years.  I feel its important to go back and listen to the 'real' music.  This cd has always been in my house, but never listened to it.  I mean who doesn't kno Bump and Grind, Your Body's Callin, It Seems Like you ready.  But to me those aren't the only good ones on the cd.  I love the uptempo jams like HOMIE LOVER FRIEND, FREAK DAT BODY, my fave uptempo being SUMMER BUNNIES! It just screams old summer jam!  But besides the obvious the good songs all the releases SEX ME AND 12 PLAY are just so damn good.  There has never been an r&b cd since this and it's a tough act to follow."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember being twelve years old when the 12 Play album came out. At the time there really was no other male R&B singer doing it like Mr. Kelly expect for my boy Ralph Tresvant. As I've said in other reviews, R.Kelly's ballads are what make the CD work. Of course everyone knows the singles Your Body's Callin ,It Seems Like You're Ready, Bump & Grind, Sex Me Parts 1 & 2 but there was also the self titled track, the heart-felt cover of Sadie and the sentimental For You. The up-tempo stuff is really weak but the ballads are on-point."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Well, I did not order this one from Amazon. Actually, I picked this up way before I was even shopping on Amazon. But Amazon is still the bomb! Anyway, I picked this cd up when it first came out in the 90's and it is STILL on rotation in my cd changer. The ladies love it and so do I. Now, I realize that R. Kelly is in a little trouble but hey, no one is perfect and we've all done things we are not proud of so, I'll continue to support his music. I'm not sure what he does in his personal life but I'll say this; what he does inside the studio allows me to do what I gotta do inside the crib. YMMV! Neosoul06...."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "R. Kelly has always been a great producer and songwriter and at least a plausible if not extraordinary singer. Though numerous legal woes have hampered his success over the past several years, he nonetheless got off to a really great start with his first album, which has a plethora of sexual undertones but still manages to sound more stylish than trashy. Contains the #1 hit \"Bump 'N Grind\" and the urban radio favorites \"Your Body's Callin'\" and \"It Seems Like You're Ready\". There is also a brilliant remix of \"Bump 'N Grind\" on the single for that song, entitled the \"Definition Of A Hotti Remix\". This was played a lot on my local radio station, and for those of you who haven't heard it, I strongly recommend. It is more blissful and sensual than the original in my opinion."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "12 Play is the debut album from R. Kelly. This album is great if you love R&B; and sexual themes.\"Your Body's Callin\", \"Bump N' Grind\", \"Homie Lover Friend\", \"Summer Bunnies\", \"12 Play\" and \"Sadie\" are my favorite songs. The rest of the album is good too.R. Kelly has a very strong voice and he produces, writes and arranges all of his music which makes him a very versatile artist.If your just getting into R. Kelly, I recommend these:Chocolate FactoryTP-2.comR.The R In R&B; Collection, Vol. 1R. KellyHappy People/U Saved Meand Robert's new album, TP-3 Reloaded is real good. Songs on that album that I recommend listening to are: \"Playa's Only\", all of the \"Trapped In The Closet\" chapters, \"Remote Control\", \"Sex Weed\" and \"Sex In The Kitchen\"."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you are a fan of R&B; music there is no way you can give this album less than 5 stars. It's a classic. The crazy thing is it's not even R. Kelly's best album. That honour belongs to his self titled 1995 release.12 Play boasts the smash hits Your Body's Callin and Bump N Grind. But it also includes other quality tracks like Summer Bunnies, Sex Me and It Seems Like Your Ready. There is also a great tribute song called Sadie which is a nice change up from the sexually charged theme of the album.This album really launched the career of R. Kelly and put him on the map as one of the powerhouse r&b; acts of the 1990's and early 2000's. High recommend."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Aaliyah came out when she was 15 and had some great hip hop laced R&B; cuts with help from R. Kelly, her mentor and rumored husband.Aaliyah had a certain charisma and smooth delivery that made up for her sometimes immature lyrics (which was not her fault). Still this Cd was very important in the mid 90's. Age Ain't Nothing But a Number, Back and Forth, and At your best (You are love) were her singles but I was also impressed by her other cuts.This Cd is straight 90's music but it is Aaliyah and it is still a classic!Favs: Street Thing, Im so into you, No one Knows.., Old School, along with her singles!"}

Aaliyah has the unique ability to sing to the listener.  Her music touches my very essence.  This thirteen track album is loaded with hits.  Every track is a perfect ten.  Aaliyah is kind enough to share her fantastic artistic abilities with the world.  I thank Aaliyah for that.  I guarantee that you will love this album.  Don't think twice, buy this album.

{"label": 9, "raw": "A lot of you think this is there first national record to rise to stardom but in actualality N2DEEP Back to the hotel put E-40 and B-legit to the gold record artist status that they were bound to achieve.this record  didn't achieve that status but more than should've.if your someone who is a  pure click fan the song V-town on back to the hotel is one to get.When this  record was first released independently samples weren't cleared and when  jive picked it up they chose not to clear them and took them of the record.  bad decision.they have sold around 400,000 copies of this yet this a bay  classic. It still will most likely go gold but it would make it there  faster if they would bring back the original album.These 4 artists have  tried to hold down the westcoast while the rest of the west has been and  stayed on vacation.If you don't have this record get it but if possible hit  a store that has the original copy not the edited version."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The original release of Down & Dirty with 18 tracks is definitely one of the best albums ever made. It's a versatile gangsta rap album, that touches a lot of different topics.The beats are ahead of their time, the big names Studio Ton, Mike Mosley and Sam Bostic take care of that. E-40 is at his best on this album, his unique style and delivery with great lyrics combined. B-Legit is also on fire here, and even D-Shot comes very hard. Suga-T is only featured on one track, on Sohabs.Even though the whole album is classic, the best songs are Let's Get Drunk, On A Mission, Mr. Flamboyant, Daily Routine, You F***ed Up When You Slammed My Motha and of course Let's Side.The re-release on Jive with changed beats and narrowed tracklist ain't anything after you've heard the original.And guess what...

{"label": 9, "raw": "I had to write this. I am a huge e-40 fan since 1993. After listening to all his cds. This is the best. Its his best beats and most creavtive lyrics and styles on this cd. I love the songs sprinkle me,dusted and Disgusted with 2pac, and one love. He made videos for all of those. This came out in 96 and he was just starting to make a national name for himself. He never matched this masterpeice.He still never really gets airplay he deserves. But get this cd."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is easily E-40's best work. &quot;In a Major Way&quot; is top-notch material from beginning to end. The beats provide classic West Coast g-funk, while 40's flows and linguistics are solid as usual.Nearly every track is equal in calibur, but the 3 stand-outs would probably be the classic &quot;Dusted &amp; Disgusted,&quot; &quot;1-Luv,&quot; and &quot;Spittin.&quot;There's not one weak track on here. If you're into the West Coast sound, and even if you're not, this is an album you should definitely have in your collection.The West could use another album of this calibur these days."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Critics trashed this album when it came out.  Too polished, overproduced, not like down and dirty.........blah blah blah.This is a great album that showcases their growth and success.  Everybody really does a good job on this album.  This second album has more great songs than their third Album &quot;money and muscle, and better performances, and more mature than Down and Dirty.  Definite satisfaction.Take the down and dirty album and add about million dollars worth of production value and you get this album.  The group probably won't make a fourth album so this is the one everyone will remember."}

B-LEGIT also rocked his solo joint &quot;We dont f*ck wit' dat&quot;. Sister SUGA T. gets down and dirty with her call out &quot;If i took your boyfriend&quot; (The much used PRINCE sample)Other standouts are the gangsta story &quot;Be about your paper&quot; and &quot;Hot ones echo thru the ghetto&quot;"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "For his second solo album, KRS-One worked with a variety of younger hip-hop talents, perhaps in an attempt to resuscitate his street credibility and his commercial standing. Featuring appearances by Das EFX, Mad Lion, Fat Joe, and Channel Live, KRS-One is loaded with fresh talent of the first-rank and they help spark the Teacher into giving an inspired performance. The album also showcases a bit fuller production than Return of the Boom Bap, but that doesn't mean he has sold it out -- it just means he's continuing to experiment, which is one of the reasons KRS-One remained a vital artist nearly a decade after his first record."}

There is way too many 4 Stars for this album but besides that Mr. KRS-One has delivered possibly the best hip hop CD of 1995 the singles were bangin \"Rappaz R N Danja\" starts the album off perfect with premier on the track you can't go wrong \"Ah Yeah\" has a killer drum beat and is one of my favorites from the album, MC's Act Like They Don't Know\" is the hardest track KRS ever did and definitely is Premiers top produced track \"Free mumia\" is dope as hell KRS produced this himself \"Hold\" is KRS describing a gun and what it means to hold one classic track \"The Truth\" a song about religion and who where the first human beings on earth which is we all know Adam and Eve \"Build ya skills\" a dope track featuring Busta Rhymes classic feature right here but enough talk go out and buy this album it truly is KRS-One best solo album post BDP era."}

Some of the other tracks that just brings this CD to the forefront is &quot;Killa Kali&quot; & &quot;Skanless A** B******&quot;, & &quot;Funk Season&quot;.

{"label": 9, "raw": "Very few albums out at the moment are so good that you can listen to it from start to finish. Although this is far more mellow and laid-back than just about all of Kelly's other albums, the consistant quality of the songs make this a treat to the ears.Kelly has said that it was around this time that he discovered God. God really must have inspired him, as it is far greater than his previous work (although 12 Play is a classic).Just about the best ballad Kelly ever wrote (&quot;I Can't Sleep Baby (If I) is probably the best song on the album, followed closely by the mid tempo &quot;Thank God It's Friday&quot;. The multi-octave style of Marvin Gaye can be seen used here. It is a pity Kelly doesn't use it anymore.If you are just getting into his work and are not going for the more hardcore elements of &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;, get this album as it will really open the door to what tis guy is trying to say."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the album that really made me take notice of \"Tha Rrah\"! I gave it a 5 star rating because as a music lover, any album that grabs my attention & allows me to listen all the way through without skipping is classic in my book.  This album just flows from song to song, no production flaws, no songs that jarred my sensabilities.There's not a bad song on this disc but the standouts to me are:You Remind Me of Something - classic slow jam for the 90's(You To Be Happy) w/ Notorious B.I.G. - great collaboDown Low - who can forget that epic videoI Can't Sleep Baby - love this song!Trade in My Life - as powerful as \"I Believe I Can Fly\""}

I love love love Down Low, Can't Sleep (Baby) and Thank God It's Friday - they are the best cuts on here.  He's such a great talent, and so underrated.  He's soulful and a joy to listen to.  Despite whatever goes on in his personal life, he remains one of my top favourite singers ever.  Down Low is among my top 10 favourite songs of all times and I could listen to this cd over and over again, never get sick of it."}

This is when we had to realize, \"this brother is talented!!!!\"  This album was good because he had some of his love songs on it, then the songs to make you groove, and threw in some spirtual songs to round it off.  There is something for everyone on this CD.My favorite cuts on this CD:2. Hump Bounce - nice litte groove6. Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby7. You to be Happy8. Down Low - the relationship between he and Isley was born9. I can't sleep baby14.Temp Slow16.

When you listen to Y'all Aint Ready Yet and Here I Go you can tell that Mystikal put effort into his raps and wasnt going through the motions like he does now. Out That Boot Camp Clicc remains as one of my favorite tracks from Mystikal. As for flaws, there are none. This album was Mystikal at his best. I really think he messed up when he decided to go commercial and put out lackluster material(four albums later). Bottom Line: Mind Of Mystikal is one of the best releases in 1995 and is Mystikal's best album. The production was cool and Mystikal was hungry as hell back then. Standout Tracks: YALL AINT READY YET(original and remix), MURDERER, BEWARE, I'M, HERE I GO, OUT THAT BOOT CAMP CLICC, MIND OF MYSTIKAL, NOT THAT N****, NEVER GONE BOUNCE(The Dream)."}

The best songs are \"One Day,\" \"Murder,\" \"Pinky Ring,\" \"Diamonds & Wood,\" and my personal favorite along with track 5 is \"Hi-Life\" because that song is so real.  These are no sugarcoated, powder puff rappers that  you hear on the radio.  UGK is too real.  Get UGK's entire collection because they never put out a wack album.

In 1997 when this album was released,it sold by the dozens just like Hanson's MIDDLE OF NOWHERE album. Hit songs include EVERYBODY(Backstreet's Back)*,QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEART,I'LL NEVER BREAK YOUR HEART,ALL I HAVE TO GIVE and AS LONG AS YOU LOVE ME,all later recycled for 2001's THE HITS-CHAPTER ONE. SET ADRIFT ON MEMORY BLISS contains music excerpts for Spandau Ballet's TRUE. Personally,this album,like every other BSB album,I believe is one of the greatest ever recorded. It continued to sell well throughout 1998. *How could that be? They just started."}

Although BSB is adored by millions of pre-teen girls, you shouldn't totally dismiss this album.  However, this is their first album and they have gotten much better over the years.  I never understood how this music is considered &quot;pop&quot; when all it is R&amp;B.  But that's all a part of a critic's job- to neatly place everyone in a particular musical category."}

The BSB's were kinda the start of the commercially put together boy band craze. At least, since this album came out, it seems that every guy and his brother want to be in a boy band. Even though nearly every guy will profess that they hate the BSB's and all boy bands. However, I must admit that the songs are catchy and danceable, and on the whole, harmless fun. But certainly nothing that will last for generations. A hundred years from now, heck..50 years from now, they will be forgotten along with Britney, but for now, they are here, so enjoy while you can."}

I'll admit this ain't 40's best, but it's far from his worst and it does deserves five stars even though it's more like 4.5.Definitely check this out if you're interested in some west coast talent.Also check out music by Too Short, South Central Cartel, Havoc &amp; Prodeje, B-Legit, Richie Rich, The Click, Celly Cel.. oh my God so many talents that never get the props they deserve.

The CD from top to bottom is just superb from &quot;City 2 City&quot; with LeVitti, &quot;For So Long&quot;(Mike Mosley doing what he does best), &quot;Check It Out&quot;(Kurupt & E-40 adds some great lyrics on this track and Studio Ton provides a great mob beat to it), &quot;Gotta Buy Dope From Us&quot;(C-Bo & Little Bruce serves up some game on this track). I can go on & on but this is just a sample of how good this CD is. There is not one weak track on here. The Hemp Museum is in a class of it's own. Check It Out!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was the best hip hop album i've ever heard and what makes me mad is that the legendary Krs didn't get noticed because of his looks, but his lyrical talent is what should be noticed bacause by far he remains the greatest lyrical rapper ever, and some other great lyrical rappers who don't get noticed that much like Keith Murray, Mos Def, Skee Lo and Dead Prez should because they are the revolutions of hip hop, and if the game is interested in looks more than talent, then hip hop is dead. But nontheless, this is the man that inspired many known rappers today, including LL Cool J, Jay Z, Nas, Twista, Public Enemy etc and in my point of view is the greatest rapper alive. So if you like hip hop, Krs One, fresh tracks and collaberations, this album has it all, the legendary Krs One will forever remain the greatest lyrical rapper in the world, no one can reach his level."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In my opinion, this is KRS best solo effort so far. I can't skip no tracks. From beginning to end, this whole CD is pure form of the term real peoples can recognize as: HIP-HOP. Tracks like \"The MC\", \"Step into a world\" or \"A friend\" are real classics, such as the entire album. This is a fresh air of hip-hop which is mocked by fake, gangsta-like, commercial freaks like Puffy, Nelly, St. Lunatics or them C(TR)a$h Money what-do-you-call-them's... This is TRUE hip-hop! If you a fake cat, don't buy this! This is not meant for Y'ALL! But if you like TRUE hip-hop skills, then buy it! NOW!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Think Mystikal cant come out with a classic album but he did.  in 97.  He has an original style with the occassional outlashes of quick spit fire deliveries ( Unpredictable) an aggressive style and a laid back style. Mystikal flows with ease. His sound is natural and doesnt seemed forced. The production on this album is ok but it is Mystikals skill and charisma that saves some songs like &quot;13 years&quot;.  Here we go adds some west coast flavor with E-40 and B Legit and is the best song on the album.  Still Smokin is a nice chillin track.  The title track is his best display of his fast flow and it comes off tight.  The man Right Chea is o;h yes tight.  Must Give Instrumental to me.......  D... on the Track is a nice song also.  Other tight songs include Did I do it, Aint no limit, Murder 2.  Exceptional cd. Pick It Up."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is Mystikal's 1st LP 4 No Limit. He has another on Big Boy Records. This CD IS HOTT. THE RHYMES THE BEATS. ITS LIKE NO LIMIT AND MYSTIKAL WERE MENT TO BE TOGETHER. Mystikal is the man right chea. This screaming man on  the tank expresses his feelings 4 the man who killed his sister and just  out right rapping. Also the man can free stlye. He shows his talent on here  we go with here we go. Also on this cd you can find rhymes by master p,  silkk the shocher, B-Legit, E-40, SNOPP DOGG and the flow of O'Dell. But  the song that is off the hook is STIL SMOKIN'. A Song which is he has  continued off his 1st cd. All i can say is that No Limit is in the spot  light with this man he is the most popular man on No Limit. Pick up the CD  and you will feel the flow of the Man they call Mystikal."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "2pac is the most lyrical and heartful rapper i have ever listen to. They have Amaru Records still going strong with 8 released 2pac cds since his death. This one is another classic with my favorite songs like \"Open fire\",R U Still Down (Remember Me), \"Hellrazor\", \"I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto\", and \"Definition of A Thug N***\". Well, im gonna stop boring the crap out of you all. This just shows you how good and kick ass this cd is. In my opinion if ya want a 2pac cd that has come out after his death this and the 7 day theory is the ones you want, peace out. RIP 2pac Amaru Shakur."}

Buy this one if u r a BIG fan of 2pac. also reminds of good times with Biggie (B.I.G)I tried to get it from different stores when it came out but this album was always OUT OF STOCK finally i got it (along time ago) and It is still in my CD player. Never got out from there.For me this is the best rap album EVER! and also 2pac's greatest work."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I personally like their newer stuff better because they christened their sound over time and Justin's voice got better but he has always been a political genius and it shows here as much as in any other album. The lyrics are incredible in almost every song but the best songs are You'd Do The Same, Die For The Government, Red White and Brainwashed, F*** Police Brutality and my personal favorite Punk By The Book. Also Drink Drank Punk is a funny one and She's My Little Go-go Dancer is a good song but the lyrics are kind of dumb. Most of the other songs are also good for a listen except for a few like Your Daddy Was A Rich Man Your Daddy's F***ing Dead which to me just get annoying. Overall this is a great PUNK album but I personally prefer albums such as Underground Network and The Terror State"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A very pleasant album, immaculately produced, perhaps a masterpiece of British folk. The songs are nice and pleasing, very pleasant to listen to: relaxing. Drake's delicate acoustic guitar work is fine and suits the songs perfectly, augmented by fine string and wind arrangements (though they can be slightly overbearing at times), and bright splashes of piano. Drake's own lyrics are beautiful examples of understated emotional poetry. His vocals are distinctive, very English, and a good medium for communicating this poetry, especially with this musical backing. It's a nice package. Certainly a hallmark recording for anyone interested in British folk."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "nick drakes debut album sounds like the starting point for a lost cult legend. even though it's nicks first album, he sounds as though he has been recording his entire life. it's a very sad album (although not as sad as pink moon, mind you), but includes many more instruments than later works. there isn't a bad number on this entire album. every song is a work of art. nicks lyrics(even though they're much more like poetry) sound as though they were written in the 17th century. they really are works of genius and beauty, and nick was without a doubt, one of the greatest poets of the 20th century."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "My favourite tracks on this debut album are those with a fuller instrumentation, i.e. Time Has Told Me with its beautiful electric guitar, piano and bass; Way To Blue with its melancholy mood elegantly expressed in a complex melody and sensitive string arrangement, and; Cello Song, a hypnotic love song with a magical interplay of cello, bass and congas. I also like The Thoughts Of Mary Jane and Three Hours, a brooding little number. As with all Drake's work, the overall mood is one of sadness wrapped in dreamy melodies, where the poetic lyrics take the listener to far-away places."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "this is a truly incredible debut. almost every track is exceptional. cello song is really beautiful,time has told me is another classic featuring great steel guitar work from richard thompson. way to blue has some great orchestration that is not overdone. three hours includes some intricate guitar. fruit tree shows the  profound mystery, beauty and tragedy of drake's tunes.  saturday sun is one of the greatest things he ever did, it seems to me that few people regard this jazzy piece as one of his all time best but it is. the vibes, piano, drums, and bass on that song are terrific, not to mention drake's excellent voice. the man was  definitely one of the greatest of songwriters it is too bad this didn't sell well enough to bring him the acclaim he so richly deserved. try bryter later and pink moon as well,  for there are lots of classics in drake's short catalogue."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "To actually access the music of Nick Drake, you have to get past a lot of baggage: the biographical legend; the twee aesthetic, aptly signified by the blandly psychedelic cover, fey title and spelling; the voice, an adolescent-whisper-falsetto type thing when it's not trying to be Bob Dylan.  Once you do get past all that, the album is a vaguely pleasant, if indistinguishable, wash of folk pop, with unexpected instruments - cello, piano, harpsichord, sax etc. - keeping things interesting (some of the songs sound like an earnest Divine Comedy).  There is one stand-out track, however, 'Poor Boy', part-Jobim samba, part-Legrand French cafe pop, part-Stones gospel.  Its pop melancholy suggests where Drake's true talents lay."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The closest thing to a mainstream album that Nick ever recorded. There's even a near-rocker (\"Hazy Janey II\"), albeit one in Nick's usual somber style. I actually don't think this is nearly as good as the previous record or the next one: a bunch of weak instrumentals (title track; \"Sunday\"; \"Fly\"), and \"Poor Boy\" is the closest to overproduced Drake gets. Regardless, there are several fantastic songs: \"Hazy Janey II\" and its psychedelic-folk counterpart, \"Hazy Janey I\"; \"At the Chime of a City Clock\", which is some good jazzy stuff; \"One of Those Things First\" is charming but slightly rambling; and \"Northern Sky\" is one of the most resonant pieces in Drake's catalogue, which is saying something. So it's slightly uneven, but the best songs make it very worthwhile."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Definitely Nick Drake's most mainstream release in his all too brief discography, Bryter Layter is filled with more somber guitar lines, Nick's expressive vocals, and even drums/flutes/other instruments! Wow!Those elements are a turn off for those who like more of his raw and unpolished music, but a lot of the songs on this album are just as emotional as those on Pink Moon or 5 Leaves Left, though some of the songs can do without the overproduction.Still worthy of a listen, and of a purchase."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is the key Nick Drake album to get, with its excellent production values, and fully realized arrangements.  He's in great voice, and each song gets a sensitive treatment, whether its sonorous strings, or a bopping horn section, or a quiet bluesy piano.  The sax on At the Chime of a City Clock it is worth the price of admission.  Sad he couldn't hold it together enough to make more music--sad he died so young, but many in his era's British folk scene suffered, too.  This album is haunting AND optimistic--just listen to Hazy Jane II.  A classic which creates a mood from the first to the last track."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Nick Drake's &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; is an awesome CD, my favorite song on this CD is &quot;Fly&quot;.  I love this song it is soft, simple, light, and exceptionally mellow. It reminds me of water, because it is cool and crisp of extreme necessity. It drenches and washes the soul freeing and setting it free -- kind of like a fly.I find this CD to be the best that I have ever heard. I love groups like Bread, Ambrosia, and Fleetwood Mac. Mr. Drake definitely had his on sound and nobody . . . I do not think that anyone could ever produce such lovely music as he did. I wish that he could have produced more. Either way what he left behind was indeed a legacy.I am truly blessed by listening to such music that inspires the senses and the heart.  Mr. Drake's music is truly touching and soothing to the soul . . ."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Nick Drake's second album, Bryter Layter, is the &quot;lightest&quot; sounding of the three he released during his lifetime.  While not happy by any means, there is a breezy sound that flows throughout the album that adds a lighter touch to such brooding tracks as &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Poor Boy&quot; and the two &quot;Hazy Jane&quot; songs.  The standout track on the album is the incredible &quot;At The Chime Of A City Clock&quot; which digs at the depths of the man and he confessionally lays his thoughts on the table.  Another striking album from the troubled yet talented singer."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is Nick Drake's most upbeat album, which isn't saying much, I realize.  He does combine elements of smooth jazz, horn lines and sax into his folk sentiments; it works well together.  While I wouldn't call it a happy album, it is nice, smooth and mellow.As always Drake's lyrics are built upon a series of images, mostly derived from nature.  Personally I find them the strongest element of his composition; but in this album the music is superb as well."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "There are three eseential Nick Drake albums:Five Leaves Leftwith its chamber folk,Bryter Layterwith its huge arrangements. and Pink Moon.Pink Moon is bassically Drake on solo accustic guitar. But Drake was no strummer. His complex composing and full guitar playing--he could strum, pick, and almost orchestrate with a simple accustic--make these full songs, rich in sound like jazz classical minitures.The sad Drake alone is a whisful, poiniant experiance, and listening to the beatiful music on Pink Moon is a trip like few others--queiting and disquieting, sad and comforting.Essential"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's impossible listen to Pink Moon without tears in the eyes. Drake's would be dead months later and music would be in the listeners minds forever. But the sound made by that 25 years-old englishman with his words  and single guitar remains stronger than poetry, than VW commercials (that I  didn't and I won't see here in Brazil), than all the simple things. This  disc is a statement of life and how big it can be, Drake is saying death is  possible. And only someone who knew the life can say it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I thought with all the new found attention the song is getting (due to the very nice VW commercial) I'd add this to my reviews.This is a classic collection of short, soft-folk driven music with amazing guitars and lyrics  to die for. It's certainly is nice to see everyone finding out about his  music...finally. Artists like Belle and Sebastian certainly have Nick to  thank for their own style here in the new century. Like Ian Curtis after  him, Nick was a genius for the ages. He was a more dark artistic type a  songwriter, one who was simply a special unique voice way before his time  or ours.please feel free to check out my other reviews."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "One of the greatest folk records out there. Not much else needs to be said. We lost a genius to an overdose. Not really appreciated in his time but this record will stand forever as long as it is available to listen to. The stark and fluid guitar work is contrasted with a voice so soothing, so troubled, and so damning of the culture around it. I can't really say much more. This record is an outstanding piece from one of our greatest musicians. The remastered tracks sound every bit as good as they should. Perfection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Never has music this beautiful been made. This is a precise peice of art, and you only wish he had made 20 or so albums. IT is very bare and to the point, but it is also inspiring. On a warm Fall day, or a cool night, put this on and sit back and relax, and let the music flow over you. It's pretty amazing, and i don't know why anyone would deny that. Hope no one does. Beck's \"Sea Change,\" and THe Sundays must have been made with this album in mind. So if you like them you'll love this, or vice versa. Besides the first song it is just Nick Drake and his guitar in a very stripped down personal setting, that sounds so fresh it feels like he's in the room. If it is possible to cry over an album of music then this is the one you'll be crying over. IT is that beautiful."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Being a big fan of Iron & Wine, Sufjan, Joshua Radin, Elliott Smith, and Damien Rice, I thought I would try out this CD (also bought \"Five Leaves Left\"), as he seems to be an original...and I was impressed.  Nick's guitar work is very solid, his lyrics poignant, his voice mellow, and his songs strong.  The CD whips through quickly with its short songs (too short!), and I could definitely hear his influence in the modern day singers I mentioned above.  Although I prefer the modern singers, this CD definitely will work its way into my rotation.  I definitely recommend this album for those that enjoy this type of music...if you prefer Iron & Wine over Blackeyed Peas, or Sufjan over Timberlake, or Radin, Elliott, and Rice over Maroon 5, then you must buy this CD.  But do like I did...wait until Amazon puts it for sale under $10.00."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "\"Pink Moon\"(1972)...is the 3rd and final recording we were blessed with by Nick Drake...This album consists of Nick alone-vocals,acoustic guitar and piano-where on his previous releases \"Five Leaves Left\"(1969) and \"Bryter Layter\"(1970)...he was accompanied by studio musicians, also featuring John Cale, and with bass and string arrangements provided by the Excellent Robert Kirby...Pink Moon is an essential piece of music history...and will be forever recognized as some of Nick's finest work...Although ANY of the [3] albums are sure to please...I own all [3] and would be lost without them...How strange that Nick died in 1974...5 years(leaves)after the album \"Five Leaves Left\" was released...He is sadly missed-a poet, a wisened old soul who died at an all too early age...yet the perfect age to preserve who and what he was."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I, too was shocked and amazed (and a little saddened)to hear Nick's Pink Moon used to shill for automobiles, and I can't help but wonder what people will make of this if they buy it because of the TV ad...this could most  accurately be described as &quot;uneasy listening&quot;, on a par with Neil  Young's &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; and I would instead recommend  Bryter Layter for the uninitiated. However, this is my personal favorite  Drake LP, so yes, buy this one too, so you can discover what a very select  few have known for years...that Nick Drake was a major talent and the world  is a poorer place for his passing."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I was a latecomer into Nick Drake's music. As many other people, I re-discovered him \"thanks\" to the media hype of recent times. And boy am I happy I did! Nick Drake's music combines the best elements of folk and brit psychodelia.When I listen to Drake, besides entering a peaceful state where I feel in perfect communion with the rest of the universe, I remember music from Jeff Buckley, Elliott Smith (both, no longer among us as well), Rufus Wainwright and even Cat Stevens...Sad thing, how after thirty years of his passing, a commercial may bring his music back to life, some say. Me, I feel it's all just fine: Nick's posthumous album brings 1972 all back, with one mellow tune after another in 2004 or any other year you choose to play it, making it the perfect soundtrack to ride to and back from work, write to or quite simply... sit back and let go."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is just guitar and voice with a smattering of piano here and there. It contains classics like \"Radio\", \"Which Will\" and the well-known title track. \"Know\" is almost bluesy with its simple guitar and haunting voice, while the jangling guitar of \"Parasite\" has an almost hypnotic quality. \"Ride\" has a lovely pop melody and has been covered by other artists, I think. \"From The Morning\" is another pastoral gem. Although delectable in its minimalist elegance, Pink Moon is not my favourite Nick Drake album. I just enjoy his voice more with a fuller instrumental backing. Still, this remains a minimalist classic."}

This is a great album &amp; I've got to admit that it was that VW add that made me give Nick Drake another shot... really a mellow classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "i had this review completely written when my power went out a few hours ago. and you know how frustrating it is to try to write something over by memory, so i won't. basically, i was disappointed by this album because i love self and was expecting their debut to sound really fresh and exciting and creative, but it's frankly not as good as their &quot;breakthrough&quot; album--if it can be called such--breakfast with girls. and of course, nothing tops their recorded-using-only-toy-instruments off-the-wall masterpiece gizmodgery, which everyone in the world should own (i recently sold my copy for 27 bucks at half.com...it's out of print, and i'm counting on it being rereleased relatively soon). anyway, subliminal plastic motives sounds like a fifth album, tired, uninspired, and while self had definitely already established the roots of their unique electropop sound, it wouldn't achieve ultimate fruition until the 2nd or 3rd album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Self is one of the most innovative pop-rock bands of the 90's and it's a damn shame to see Mike never broke out into the mainstream.  Subliminal Plastic Motives, while not his best album (that goes to Gizmodgery which was made only using toy instruments), it's probably the best for a new fan to get.Musically the album contains everything from Power pop and jazz to hip hop influenced beats and Nirvana guitar progressions.  The way Mike uses each instrument is amazing, I especially love how he uses keyboards and pianos.  Plus vocally he's killer, very warm and inviting.  Some of my favorite tracks off the album are the single So Low, Borateen, Big Important Nothing (which features amazing jazzy keyboards), and Cannon."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Though it was his second studio album, it contains so many classics that it could be called a greatest hits album.  &quot;Radio Radio,&quot; &quot;This Year's Girl,&quot; &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea&quot; were some of the top songs of the new wave.  They sound just as full of spit and vitriol today as they did almost a quarter century ago.  It was amazing to hear Elvis finally do &quot;Radio Radio&quot; on SNL, backed up by the Beastie Boys!  If you're wondering when Elvis was actually &quot;cruel,&quot; listen to this masterpiece!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Costello's first album, MY AIM IS TRUE, was perfect. His second album, THIS YEAR'S MODEL, is even better. On this album, all of the sexual tension that had been built up on his debut gets released. Just take a look at the  song titles. This album is very much about sex. Fortunately, Costello is  literate enough that he doesn't have to stoop to using graphic language.  Instead, he uses all sorts of similies and metaphors. This album just  explodes with energy. Also, this album serves as a wonderful transition  from his first album, MY AIM IS TRUE, to his third album, ARMED FORCES."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Costello's second album continues in the same vein as his debut, angry tales of love, lust, and sheer pent up frustration. Dominated by Steve Nieve's organ, this CD is more polished than Costello's debut, but it feels a little over produced compared to the stripped down sound of his first release. Despite this the songs still create a sense of tension rarely found in anyone's music. &quot;Radio, Radio&quot; may be one of the greatest songs ever about the idea of &quot;popular music&quot; and its effect on us all and the double play of &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;Pump It Up&quot; sums up teen years pretty well. Costello is a truly original talent and this CD shows him during the early years, still coming to grips with many of the same ideas and fears that faced his liteners. This review is of the original American recording)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "elvis costello is never easy to pin down. he's a punk, a crooner, a folkie and a jazzman all at once. one thing is certain, he is a brlliant artist and a great songwriter, with a healthy pop sense. before costello branched out into other styles, his main focus on the punky side of pop. and this is his most defining moment in that era. each song on here crackles with the tight energy associated with punk, but there is too much tongue and cheek for this be hardcore. moreover, the songwriting is just too clever to ignore, further removing \"this year's model\" from the general english punk movement. elvis was always too civilized to be chaotic and angry, more of a crossed up lover than anything else. this year's model is just a brilliant album overall and should be in anyone's collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This second album by Elvis Costello is far better than My Aim is True, in my opinion. The tunes are more immediate with much more of a pop flavour whilst the music is also more rhythmically varied and compelling. It marks the transition to his wonderfully accessible Armed Forces masterpiece.There is even a reggae beat in (I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea and a ballad with lovely piano - Little Triggers. My favourites on the original disc are the up-tempo Pump It Up, You Belong To Me and the poignant This Year's Girl, plus of course the pulsating Radio Radio with its subversive lyrics. Night Rally is somewhat dark and disturbing.The second disc includes a wealth of previously unreleased tracks, demo tracks, live and alternative versions. Not all of these alternate takes are as gripping as the familiar versions but they are certainly interesting and worthwhile, demonstrating various facets of his extraordinary musicianship."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Rhino Records and Elvis Costello deserve high praise for this re-release. This two cd set contains the original album on the first disc and a second disc of outtakes, live versions and an odd couple of songs- all of fairly high quality. Accompanying the two cds is an essay by Elvis Costello commenting on the songs and the history behind their inclusion or exclusion in the case of the second cd.This Years model features a young Elvis Costello fresh from his Saturday Night Live \"Radio Radio\" era. The cd is full of quirk energy, clever lyrics and youthful anger. From first song to last there isn't a bad tune.  The additional cd contains the lost \"Big Tears\" which Costello explains should have been included in the original album. Also in the second cd are live versions and a cover of the Damned \"Neat Neat Neat\". This album and the half dozen or more to follow were among the most influential music being made by the Punk/New Wave . Great stuff."}

But the lyrics and the music itself points to a hope beyond the darkness, although certainly one of Cockburn's intentions is, Brecht-like, to create enough angst in us to not forget that there is a world rife with....well, what shall we call it? Terror?  Sin?  Bad Guys?  beyond our speakers. Bruce is a superb musician and his voice is haunting.  A jewel among the Cockburn collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Elvis Costello is one of the music world's smartest artists. He also has a gift for finding the greatest musicians. The bassist, Bruce Thomas, is the most innovative rock player I've ever heard. Elvis' thoughtful lyrics are perfectly suited to his driving band.Unlike most artists, Elvis Costello has an excess of ideas in most songs. He also writes far too many songs. The extra tracks written at the same time are very good and are thankfully included here. Hats off to Rykodisc for treating this artist with the respect he deserves by reissuing these recordings properly. Other record labels should learn alot from them.[DW]"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought this album the week it came out, and as a high school tenth grader and aspiring guitarist/ pop songwriter it was the wisest purchase I could have made. This is a recording that shaped me musically in just so  many ways. Elvis in his early days (first 5 or 6 albums) was the man as far  as lyrics go. No one else could ever be this clever with words. The  Attractions, especially Bruce Thomas on bass(one of the best in pop)were  the perfect band for Costello. I see the live EP (At Hollywood High) which  accompanied the original LP release has been added as part of the bonus  cuts; long overdue, and that 7 inch was such a bad pressing. This release  is indescribably essential for any young aspiring modern tunesmith."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This disk represented a radical change for Elvis Costello, as he and the Attractions moved from the bare raw sound of \"This Year's Model\" toward more layers and orchestration.  Elvis states that they were listening to ABBA on the bus, but do not hold that against them.  The cascading piano and layered keys on \"Accident's Will Happen\" and \"Oliver's Army\" still spit with bile of the angry young man.  Sparse arrangements, like \"Moods for Moderns\", \"Senior Servitude\", and \"Green Shirt\" are mixed in, giving the disk a complex series of shifting moods.  Nick Lowe's influence, as demonstrated by \"Two Little Hitlers\" (Nick had recorded a tune called \"Little Hitler\" about the same time) as well as Elvis' definitive cover of Nick Lowe's \"What So Funny (About Peace, Love and Understanding)\" shine throughout the release.  Listen to the complicated word play and lyrical mastery throughout the disk.  A must have!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Let's think about this: the first three Elvis Costello albums were released in succession, with a year for all of them being recorded. They are all the same quality of songs, with minor upgrades in technique across the year. I am not implying that any one is better than another one. They are a good set of albums for the music poetry lover. In fact, the best course of action, would be to just buy all three. I find them complementary as well as, music for the times! This review has nothing to do with the lovely female friend I mentioned in my last EC album review. That's really my opinion."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "For all you Costello completists out there, DO NOT toss your Rykodisc copy once you get this new Rhino version.  There are two \"Live in Aberdeen\" tracks on the Ryko pressing that did not get carried over onto the new one.As for the record itself, when I first bought the vinyl 20+ years ago, I knew very few of the songs and had none of the original versions.  Now I have almost all of them, as well as a deep appreciation for country music.  I have Elvis and my wife to thank for that!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I love country music -- the real stuff -- the kind Elvis attempts here. I also love Elvis Costello; for the past week, I have listened incessantly to his collaboration with Burt Bacharach, \"Painted From Memory.\"*So with that as a perspective, I have to say that this may be the weakest effort in the entire Elvis catalog. Getting Billy Sherrill in Nashville surely was the right thing to do, but these songs don't click, and about none of these covers can stand along side the original. I can't specifically carp about the playing or the vocals, but where they fail is in capturing the heart, the spirit, the feel of country music. They sound too much like an experiment. Years later, Van Morrison, another giant, would fail in a similar effort.*For sure, this is not a \"bad\" album, but there are 20 better collections that Elvis has recorded and thousands of better country albums."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Listen to the opening lines of \"The Loved Ones\" and you hear Costello at his best. Snappy lines, sung with force and definitely dripping with caustic wit. Then we hit the piano \"noodling\" and the song starts to drift away from me. The CD is filled with moments like this; great lyrics and a solid melody often lost amidst overproduced musical adornments. Stripped down, this is some of Costello's best stuff; songs that walk the fine line between emotion and intellect. But every time I feel like I get close to the heart of the song, I feel lost in the middle of music that serves no purpose. This is definitely worth a listen and I still enjoy popping it in the machine, but I feel some of his other works is more deserving of the high praise given IMPERIAL BEDROOM."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember reading an interview in 1982 where Elvis Costello expressed his desire to have someone like Frank Sinatra cover his tunes (as opposed to Linda Ronstadt). Out of that urge came IMPERIAL BEDROOM, and it shows wonderfully. Whether Elvis Costello was simply maturing or just displaying a side of his songwriting talent that he had to suppress for so long, I couldn't say. But IMPERIAL BEDROOM was certainly an ambitious and far-reaching album. &quot;Man Out of Time&quot;, &quot;Shabby Doll&quot; and &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; are incredibly brilliant compositions that, frankly, stunned me back in 1982. I couldn't get over the mix of sophistication and drama in these melodies. While I knew Costello was incredibly talented, I honestly didn't know he had such range.I don't think that Ol' Blue Eyes even bothered to listen to anything on this album--seriously doubt it. But for my money, just for the first few songs alone, this cd is worth every penny."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I've always thought \"Imperial Bedroom\" to be Elvis' masterpiece and only recently listened to it again through headphones a la REM's \"Up\". I'd never listened to it before this way and the sound and subtle nuances are even better enjoyed this way. Elvis' songwriting on \"Imperial Bedroom\" was at it's most crisp, witty and insightful. Every track on here is a true jem...a shining jewel. Well worth the money if you spring for the gold masterdisc. Some of these songs made me cry then and still resonate now. I'm glad I saw him on the \"Imperial Bedroom\" tour and glad I have this CD!I still get a kick out of how one track bleeds into the next with assorted yelps and screams.  And the lyrics...my God...at his peak Elvis really was brilliant!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The mix sounds a little different for this edition -- which is something I haven't quite made up my mind about just yet -- but the real find here are the rare tracks found on the bonus disc, which range from brilliant (an early, more vemonous take of \"You Little Fool\"; a completely altered \"Little Savage\"), to weird-but-enlightening (\"The Land of Give and Take\"; rough, early run-throughs of \"Man Out of Time\").  All things considered, this is essential listening for the Costellophile and a great way to kill a few hours.  Or years."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's commonly agreed that 'Goodbye' is not one of Costello's better efforts.  I concur, but must confess enjoyment of two songs that are generally cursed by EC purists:  'I Wanna Be Loved' and 'Only Flame in Town'.While not lyrically compelling, I find the songs musically enjoyable.  Love the strange synth feel to 'Wanna' and even the sax solo.  The demo version of 'Only Flame' on EC's 'All This Useless Beauty' bonus disc is superior to the standard recording here.  Costello originally seems to have conceived the song as a 50s style slow dance number.  It's kitschy but fun!'The Comedians', also recorded by the late Roy Orbison, is about the only other cut of significant interest.  Like 'Only Flame', the demo version of this song on Rhino's 'All This Useless Beauty' bonus disc is better than the one here."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I love E.C., I love the Attractions, I love Nick Lowe, so I was SO excited when this came out, as it was so hot on the heels of King of America. I was actually disappointed with King of America (it has improved with age, like  a fine wine), so I saw this as an obvious attempt to return to the  fantastic form of his pre-Punch the Clock days. As I listened, I was so let  down. I thought this album was a noisy mess with weak songs. As time  passed, I thought perhaps I'd been subverted by my own high expectations,  so I bought the Ryko reissue and gave it another chance. Well, my opinion  hasn't changed. It's still a struggle to listen to this album, possibly  even more so as my ears have aged and the mid-range heavy production grates  more than ever. I hate to say it, but I'd rather listen to Goodbye Cruel  World than this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "After a couple of years of more subtle work, Elvis Costello reteamed with the Attractions for a fierce, angry release, Blood &amp; Chocolate.  With producer extrodinaire Nick Lowe again manning the board, Mr. Costello spewed forth venomous songs based around his recent divorce.  &quot;I Hope You're Happy Now&quot; sums up the overall tone of the album.  &quot;Tokyo Storm Warning&quot; is a blistering extended jam, while &quot;Honey Are You Straight Or Are You Blind?&quot; is a frenetically paced rocker that harkened back to the band's late 70's sound.  &quot;I Want You&quot; is a song that conveys Mr. Costello's longing for his lost relationship. Despite the overall angry tone, the album closes with &quot;Next Time Round&quot; which shows a more wizened man that will learn from his mistakes."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Man this is one great blues guitar album! It may be listed under Albert Collins, but this is a true collaboration. Robert Cray really shines here and is much bluesier then you will find him on his own albums. All three share in the vocal duties and the guitar solos.  No one plays over each other - it's a great collaboration that results in a great album.  Just listen to the first cut and you will get a good taste of what is in store.  Buy it and enjoy."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's nothing short of awesome to hear these three guitar greats come together. Albert Collins was one of the BEST blues guitarists in the world. Any recording which features him is going to be worthwhile. Robert Cray is  very good too and has a wonderful voice. Johnny Copeland contributes some  nice vocals and guitar licks, but I'm not as familiar with him as I am  Albert and Robert. There are only two downsides to this wonderful CD.  First, the sound quality isn't as good as it could be. It definitely sounds  its age. I know that Alligator is not a huge record label, but it would be  nice if they could remaster and rerelease some of their titles such as this  one. Second drawback is that the album is too short! It's so good that you  don't want it to end. It's not much longer than half an hour. But it is  good stuff. If you like guitar-based blues, BUY this CD!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Albert Collins and Johnny Copeland were two of the pioneers of Texas blues, and major influences to the late Stevie Ray Vaughan. These two guys work their magic on this CD, and bring on a young bluesman named Robert Cray. These guys just seem to have fun with this CD, never trying to outdo each other. Great riffs in the leadoff track &quot;T-Bone Shuffle&quot;, harmonica on &quot;Bring Your Fine Self Home&quot;, lyrics in &quot;Black Cat Bone&quot; (hear Johnny Copeland yelling &quot;Hey Albert!&quot;) and the last track &quot;Blackjack&quot; where each does a tremendous guitar solo. Cray, of course, is now a major talent in his own right, and Johnny Copeland lives on in a way in his daughter Shemekia Copeland's music, but here is a playful, low-key yet powerful, piece of work from some of the masters of electric blues. Highly recommended for serious blues fans."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is my 2nd time out for Baez's second album.  I'm a big fan of the first album and of her contemporary Carolyn Hester but I'd forgotten that I traded this one in years ago.  The arrangements are dull and pedestrian and it's amazing how irritating Joan's voice can be when the material (or it just the arrangements) are so weak.I'm a folk fan, Dylan, Carolyn Hester, Peter, Paul and Mary, the Weavers, Journeymen, Roger McGuinn, Fairport, Kingston Trio, and Ian and Sylvia are special favorites.  So, it's not so easy for me to dislike a straight-ahead folk album like this one.  However, I found Joan Baez's 2nd album a very difficult listen the 2nd time out.It's back in the trade-in pile (for the 2nd time!)."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "At the start of her career Joan Baez's pure, soulful voice was the signature of the early 60's folk movement; it is perhaps best displayed on this album and on Vol. 1 of the same. There is a special magic in her voice, her guitar and the response of the appreciative audience. The Portuguese song on this album, Nu Bello Cardillo, is touching but not as memorable as Ate Amanha on the first volume, while there's a lovely tremulous quality to her voice in the Dylan song With God On Our Side. My favorites on this second volume include the sorrowful tale of The Long Black Veil and the traditionals Hush Little Baby and Battle Hymn Of The Republic - the audience participation on the Hymn is very poignant and moving, and turns into a rousing spiritual experience. I personally prefer the first volume since more of those songs have personal meaning to me, but this folk classic is also an enduring treasure."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This bluegrass homage to Bob Dylan is surprisingly lively and fresh and (oddly enough) one of O'Brien's best, most straightforwardly bluegrass-y solo albums. Scott Nygaard, Jerry Douglas and others pitch in on this good-natured album, spearheaded by the longtime Hot Rize mandolinist, who has since gone on into more high-concept blue/newgrass terrain.  Here, O'Brien connects with Dylan's original old-timey influences, straightening out some of the kooky kinks Dylan had put into folk music, back in his 'Sixties heyday, and transforming classic tunes such as &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot; and &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot; into straightforward, galloping bluegrass breakdowns.  Nice to hear this music coming full circle back to its roots!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Paris is one of the many hip-hip artist from the early 1990's that didnt get alot of airplay, and mainly sold records on word of mouth. Let me tell you that even though Paris's other releases aren't as strong as this, \"The Devil Made me Do It\" has flavor that most hip-hop has lost today, and that is dealing with racial tensions, political issues, and Black History (ex..Black Panthers) The beats are also mind blowing, and this album is very Hard for the time that it was released. Even though the album is somewhat dated, it still is a treasure, and I hope people that are infactuated with todays hip-hop could take a few steps back and pick up an album of such importance. This CD belongs in EVERYONES collection. Its that good! (i only gave if 4 stars because even though it is a classic, there are some poor filler tunes here) ENJOY"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's the Hip hop's hair doo master Coolio on a debut album, my locc Coolio went from B.G. to Locc'sta from Compton, CA aka the CPT.  Like I said on my review from Gangsta's Paradice, Coolio be blowin' on some Indo or some other type of funky gangee, because Coolio was the locc who released the ultimate house party groove Fantastic Voyage by far Coolio's dopest hit, County Line is a far out Dope song by my locc, Ghetto Cartoon is a funny cartoonished song with funny lyrics, and my locc has another good one called Ugly Bitches, what!?  It's a true song by my locc Coolio.Hair doo master's best yet is *1, *2, 3, 4, *5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, *15 & 16, did I miss any songs?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Now, I'm not a big Coolio fan.  But I've just always liked the song &quot;Gangsta's Paradise&quot;.  Even though that's the initial reason I bought the album, there are many more good songs on it.  I like the song &quot;Ghetto Highlights&quot; almost as much as the title track.  &quot;Sumpin New(1,2,3,4)&quot; is a pretty catchy tune I used to hear at roller skate places a lot.  Those are my 3 favorite songs, but I also like the songs &quot;Kinda High, Kinda Drunk&quot; and &quot;Exercise Yo' Game&quot;.  The only reason I took off a star is because since this is an edited album, there are a couple of songs that could be good that are edited so much, it takes away from the songs."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "But sadly it's not enough to save the album.  Except for that one song the album fails on many levels (Even for rap music) with it's anoying lyrics, bad beats, and even bad rapping!  Personally I think this guy has got some talent and is just afraid to use it.  He proved he's got the skill to be one of the greatest rappers out there with &quot;Gangsta's Paradise,&quot; and in the &quot;Space Jam&quot; soundtrack he (With the help of other rappers) helped make the best rap song I've herd!  He just needs to use some of his talent and he could go far and shove cheap rappers like Eminem out of the way!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "As a child, Coolio was a B.G. LocC from Compton, CA.  Although Coolio ran with the Compton Loccs, Coolio had troubles fitting in with his school mates, and at the age of 17 Coolio got into the Crack-Cocaine game.  Although Coolio may not of been as sucessful as Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre or Snoop Doggy Dogg, Coolio's 1996 album Gangsta's Paradice is a West Coast Highlight.  Best hit defiently is the hit song Gangsta's Paradice, though another song that should of been a hit is Cruisin'.  Sumpin' New is another good hit by Coolio, and a good House Party song is Kinda High Kinda Drunk.Coolio's best are 2, *3, 4, *5, 6, *7, *10, 12, 13, 16 & 17."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;Gangsta's Paradise&quot; is getting to be a quite old rap song...but it's still probably one of the best ever. It definitely goes on the top of my all-time favorite rap songs list. I gave this CD 3 stars because &quot;Gangsta's Paradise&quot; is the only song I've heard off this album. I'm sure the rest of the album is pretty decent, too. But &quot;Gangsta's Paradise&quot; will probably always be one of the best rap songs! If you love Coolio's music, than this is a really great CD and you must have it. Otherwise, if you only like &quot;Gangsta's Paradise&quot;, then I suggest buying the CD-single for it or the soundtrack for DANGEROUS MINDS. Totally awesome song. Probably Coolio's best. I just love it!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Earth A.D. is probably the heaviest, most aggressive recording The Misfits have ever released. This CD features their famous song \"Die Die My Darling\", as well as many other great songs. \"Wolf's Blood\" is a twisted portrait of a man who is transforming into a werewolf. Danzig's howls of pain and aggression are amazing, and the frantic guitars and drums in the song make it a favorite. \"Queen Wasp\" and \"Earth A.D.\" are very heavy songs, although those two tracks in particle don't have great sound quality. Right after this album was released, thrash metal was unleashed in the world of Rock. Coincidence? Perhaps, but this CD obviously had to have some influence on the artists of the category. Pick this one up today."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I went and bought this cd and I was not dissapointed with it at all. I heard very good things about it and I rushed out to get it as soon as I could. In my opinion, it is one of the greatest MISFITS cd's ever made! Every song on it is no less than perfect, such as,&quot;Earth A.D.&quot;, &quot;Die die my darling&quot;, &quot;We bite&quot;, &quot;Wolfs blood&quot;, &quot;Blood feast&quot; and many more! If your a real die hard MISFITS fan like me than go out and get this cd. It is a classic in my book!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In the mid seventies jazz-fusion was at it's peak and there was no shortage of quality records being released. For me, one of the fusion bands that stood out was Brand X. Their music was captivating, all band members were tremendous talents, but most importantly, they had an original sound. Thirty years after it's release, this debut disc still is amazing and would be a great introduction to this band. John Goodsall shreds with the best of them but his soothing guitar work is just as striking. The chirping tones that Percy Jones creates on his fretless bass are unmistakable. Robin Lumley enhances it all by playing the perfect keyboard riff at the right time, and Phil Collins, on a break from Genesis, laid down some exciting drumming, maybe some of the best he has ever done. Enjoy."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First song, 20 minutes &quot;Crises&quot; is as good as &quot;Tubular bells&quot;.  The first 2 minutes are maybe a bit too new age but the rest is really uncredible especially the Watcher and the tower part.  The great Admam Ant is playing guitar on this song.Song &quot;In high places&quot; is sang by Jon Anderson (I just can't resist him).  I did not know it was Oldfield who did &quot;Shadow on the wall&quot;, a song that I liked a lot back in early 80's.  Well, it is on this album.  &quot;Taurus&quot; is a excellent  accoustic guitar piece.The 2 others songs are okay but I am not attracted to women's voice."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Not Mike's best album, but certainly a very good one. The second part of Taurus here is one of his better epic-length compositions, here reprising at the start the original chord progression from Taurus I, but played on different instruments. It goes above and beyond the scope of the first however, across the path of it's 25 minutes. Family Man follows, a track he co-wrote with a bunch of other people, and definately a different one for Mike. It's almost like a standard rock/pop song, fused with his own guitar and instrumentation. (It later became a hit for Hall &amp; Oates.) The remaining songs are decent enough, but don't really hold up to the standard of the opening epic. Still, an Oldfield fan will want this album for it alone, in addition to the adequate tracks that fill out the album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I never fail to take this album with me when visiting family on the shores of Lake Superior. I usually put it on just as I hit Hwy 17, the music mirroring the Canadian landscape as we approach those legendary shores. There are some wonderful themes here, and while they may outstay their welcome a little (the condensed live version on Exposed may be more immediately appealing), they are never less than engrossing, with Maddy Prior's contribution an inspired choice. Is it his best? Probably not (I listen to Five Miles Out and Crises more), but there is no better album of Mike's at evoking what it was meant to.ExposedMike Oldfield / Crises"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First of all, to the reviewer who said that this album has nothing on artists like Blink 182 or Good Charlotte, you should check to see if your brain is functioning.  \"Static Age\", one of the Misfits' most well known works, is pure punk pleasure from start to finish.  Glen Danzig's howling Elvis Presley/Jim Morrison-esque voice is just great to listen to as the Misfits take rock back to it's roots with simple chords and melodies combined with Danzig's toungue in cheek B-movie inspired lyrics.  Standout tracks, like the title track, \"Last Caress\", \"Return of the Fly\", \"We Are 138\", \"Teenagers From Mars\", \"Hollywood Babylon\", \"Attitude\", and \"She\" are revered classics, and proof why this band has had an overaching legacy from 1977 to the present."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No, it's just a young Glenn Danzig. The Misfits were the epitome of punk; insofar as they had no chops to speak of. To compensate for this; they simply turned their guitar's up as loud as they possibly could. As a  corollary to this; they come across here as sounding vaguely industrial,  or; somewhat akin to another east-coast punk outfit, Suicide. Interesting  and tenative sounding record, but; I'd rather be listening to a superior  punk recording by the likes of Fear or X."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Glen Danzig and his friends have simply made the best punk cd ever.  And it would be this cd.  I guess I'm not too much into the politics of punk, but this is a truely great cd.  With its cheesy B-Horror movie lyrics, traditional punk riffs, and 50's esque vocals, this band is, in general, just a fun band.  They are by far the #1 Halloween band ever.  They don't care what anyone really thinks, so they basically do whatever they please.  Some people may be offended by some of their lyrics or something, but oh well.  Glen Danzig should have never left this band, or they would be by far one of the most respected bands ever.  Wait, they already are!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album still sounds so good.  The songs are simple but driving with great rythm lines and great drumming.  Mr. Danzig has recently in my opinion entered his fat Elvis mode(if you get a chance, you should watch the online video of him getting punched out for being an insufferable jerk), but there is no question as to the brilliance of his vocals on this album.  His voice(to continue the analogy) sounds like a possessed Elvis.  It's amazing.  Angry but in tune.  Static Age is much more in the punk vein of the Ramones, and less like bands the Germs or Black Flag, which Earth A.D. sounds more like.  The songs are all great sing alongs.  Anthems even.  I suppose his lyrics aren't for everyone, but I personally view them as ironic in that sort of dark humor kind of way.  Even if punk isn't your normal cup of tea, you should still give this album a try."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you aren't familiar with the band they consist of a piano/lead singer (who's name is Ben Folds), a bass, and drums.  They have a very unique sound, and they all came out of heavy metal bands (weird, huh).  This album gives me the feeling that this is the real, raw Ben Folds.  Before the crazy success of &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot; due to the song &quot;Brick&quot;.  My favorites on this CD are &quot;Jackson Cannery&quot;, &quot;Alice Childress&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, and &quot;Boxing&quot;.  If you bought Whatever and Ever Amen I highly recomend you experience this side of Ben Folds Five, and if you are just looking for a great album with a fresh sound, this is it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "An energetic raw introduction to this eccentric trio. An unusual combo of piano &amp; vocals (Ben Folds), bass and drums works surprisingly well, with Folds hammering-chords more than compensating for the lack of  guitar.Many pianists will be trying to play his cunning riffs... Put  this in the car and you'll soon be bashing the dashboard rather than  playing air-guitar at the traffic-lights. Whilst their later offerings have  been more polished (and with the exception of &quot;Whatever and Ever,  Amen&quot; less satisfying), none have been as frantically engaging and  down-right fun as this little stormer.A perfect summer record - crank it  up, open the windows and find new friends. Everyone seems to like this  stuff, but they don't know who it's by. Educate them!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Five stars isn't sufficient for an album that contains &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin,&quot; one of the great vocal tracks sung by anyone. Many consider this song Sinatra's greatest and Nelson Riddle's arrangement is  nothing short of electric. This is an album where you can put it on, hit  play and never fast forward, all the songs are eminently Sinatraesque and  every single arrangement has a touch of genius.Frank's phrasing is (as  always at this stage of his career) letter perfect. Listen to &quot;It  Happened in Monterey...&quot; never a particular hit, Frank rarely sang it  live, but who cares? It's immortalized here, forever.If you love  Sinatra, you will already have had this on vinyl and cassette (maybe even  eight track). If you're new to Frank, don't hesitate one moment: grab it  and listen to it for the rest of your life."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Probably my favourite Sinatra's album. Released in 1956. Arrangements are done by Nelson Riddle and songs are fabulous. Here you can hear such great songs like on of his biggest hit, Cole Porter's I've Got You Under My Skin, Gershwin brothers' Love Is Here To Stay,...Pennies From Heaven was a big hit for Louis Prima, Anything Goes (another Porter's composition) for Ella Fitzgerald,...This is one of his best albums (and not only for Capitol Records).So, lay down and enjoy this fabulous set."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was my introduction to Sinatra, thanks to the rave reviews it received from Downbeat critics and readers upon its release in the fifties.  It still holds up as Sinatra's best-balanced, most polished swing album,  the standard by which his later versions of the same songs can be compared.  This is not to say that the interpretations he gives here are the  definitive ones: some listeners may prefer later, looser versions of  &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; or &quot;Pennies from Heaven.&quot;  But  without this album it's pointless to judge the later versions--by  Sinatra or anyone else.  With this album Sinatra, more than any other male  vocalist, showed what distinguishes a jazz singer from a pop crooner."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "These recordings are now nearly fifty years old, but they contain an excitement that doesn't diminish with time.  Following quickly on the heels of his success with IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS, a 40-year-old Frank Sinatra teamed up once again with arranger/conducter Nelson Riddle and created what is arguably his best album of a stellar career. Sinatra is one of those artists that each generation rediscovers for itself. As an aging Baby Boomer, I hope that audiences will continue to listen to the Beatles a hundred years from now; but I KNOW they will be listening to Sinatra--class simply never goes out of style! If you own only one Sinatra album, this is it.  ESSENTIAL"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you like Kind Of Blue, you are in for a real treat here. Adderley, Miles and Blakey were and still are such big stars in the jazz world that their work is in a class of its own. The fact that they are collaborating here is an added bonus. Adderley's joyful sound and Miles's Emotional Charges Harmon Mute is absolutely exquisite on this album. Best cut would definately be Autumn Leaves, since Miles's work on this track almost brings a tear to my eyes because it is so beautiful."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "As I've said before, I'm not a particularly erudite jazzophile, I just appreciate a well-paced, melodic, and soulful jazz set when I hear it.  And this record is superlative.  Cannonball's LP, seemingly centered around the masterful phrasings of Miles, brings some great musicians together.  Each of them leave an indelible mark on this record, but never at the expense of the whole.  In my mind, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and &quot;One for Daddy-O&quot; are the standout tracks.Along with &quot;Kind of Blue,&quot; &quot;Giant Steps,&quot; &quot;Moanin'&quot; and &quot;Time Out,&quot; (among many others), this is an essential jazz record, not because Ken Burns or anyone else says so, but because it's evident from the first listen.  Go ahead and get it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am spending time filling in the gaps that I missed out on during the 60s and 70s. I grew up with the better known 'John Barleycorn..' and 'Low Spark..', but recently (thanks to the classic 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide)acquired 'Mr Fantasy' and their 2nd album 'Traffic'. Both knock the spots off the later Traffic, and while the critics gave 'Mr Fantasy' only 4 stars I rate it one of the best albums ever. Two songs on this album, namely 'No name, no face, not number' and 'Mr Fantasy' must be amongst the best rock songs ever, ever written (to say nothing of Steve Winwood's ethereal singing!). Regarding the issue about the US versus UK versions, I was fortunate to but a recently re-mastered CD that has both on it! Get that one, then sit back like a happy cat and lick the cream..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Mr. Fantasy is a fine cd and I would have given it 5 stars any other time. Until I bought and listened to the 2000 Island remaster of \"Heaven Is In Your Mind\" This is the original stereo american version of the album, and the one, that I have been waiting for for at least 30 years to be released. It has the original american track listing including two tracks that were dropped when they re-released it as \"Mr. Fantasy\" which is the english version (stereo much less defined). I highly recommend \"Heaven Is In Your Mind\" to anybody that grew up in the sixty's as I did, and remember the superb stereo on the original UA release."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This disk is famous for the great playing and drug influenced music.  \"Dear Mr Fantasy\", the title cut, features trippy guitar and Steve Winwood's soaring vocals.  \"Berkshire Poppies\" is an obviously a reference to one of the drugs of choice, featuring Winwood's ragtime piano. \"Dealer\" and \"Colored Rain\" are classic traffic rockers, that showcase the band's ability to mix winds and woodwinds through their music effectively. Dave Mason's \"Hole In My Shoe\" is a happier, chemically influenced tune, that shows a lighter side of his writing. In all, it is a period piece, that is different in that the melodies are catchy, and the musicanship great enough to stand the test of time."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I can't believe this is 20 years old! When Asia first came out with this package it really shook up the music world. Every song on this CD can be listened to over and over. It's rare when 4 &quot;superstars&quot; can get  together and produce a sound this good. It's rarer still when they can keep  doing it. Asia didn't. After this album they tried to  &quot;cookie-cut&quot; their songs and they became trite and boring. But  for one sweet summer this was the music that the world was loving. Do  yourself a favor. BUY THIS CD!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Asia was the first band I called \"my favourite one\". Via Asia, I got to know my later and present favourite Yes.The influence of Yes shines through in this first album of the band. It is especially obvious in the  afterplay to Cutting It Fine.But this is mainly a rock album. Some  call it prog rock - who knows why - indeed, it is true that there is more  to it than just plain 1980's rock. It has a touch, it has more soul. It is  bombastic rock without even being close to hardrock. Well worth listening  to!My favourites on this debut album are Wildest Dreams, One Step  Closer, and of course the first single Heat Of The Moment."}

Now listen to this cd again and realize how this was a poor cd.  I did and I can say that this album is really poor and I won't listen to it for the rest of my life, this is the kind of pop prog for the mass and has nothing to do with real prog music.  Instead, look for what these guys has made in the 70's with their respective bands and you'll see the difference...."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In 1982, Steve Howe of Yes, Carl Palmer of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, Geoff Downes of The Buggles, and John Wetton of King Crimson formed one of Rock's first &quot;supergroups&quot;.  The result of this union was this unvbelievable debut album.  Penned by Wetton and Downes, this album produced the classics &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; and &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot;.  This album was released at the same time MTV hit the airwaves, so these songs received many hours of play.  This album still ranks as one of my personal favorites even after 20 years.  I can't get enough of Geoff Downes' keyboard work and especially Carl Palmer's unparalleled drumming.  Each track is first-rate and the insturmentals are perfectly blended.  This album is a must for serious rock music fans."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a case in point about what was wrong with the 80's, my least favorite decade musically. In the 70's, you could trust a union of musicians of this magnitude to produce scorching, jaw dropping prog rock.  But in the 80's it only amounted to overproduced, manufactured for mass  consumption, calculated FM corporate rock. There is nothing prog about  Asia. Anyone who thinks this is prog needs to listen to these musicians in  their better days of glory with UK, Yes, ELP,King Crimson. My opinion on  this one will never change with time. File with GTR under 80's bad idea  supergroups."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In 1982, it seemed as if the new supergroup Asia would be the great white hope of AOR fans. Most of the 70's supergroups had either disbanded or faded into obscurity, and Asia looked to be the heirs of the format and the band that would continue the glories of FM rock into the 80's. Alas, after this first LP, Asia descended into mediocrity, turning out many more albums, none of which equalled this outstanding debut. This record is a document of What Might Have Been, simply put. Well worth owning, and a fitting coda to the great rock albums of the 70's."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Asia was Steve Howe, John Wetton, Geoffrey Downes, and Carl Palmer. These four guys would become instant stars with their debut album, simply titled, Asia. Howe was already an accomplished guitarist with the progressive supergroup, Yes, while Carl Palmer brought his talents from the equally-successful progressive trio, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Downes was a keyboard player for Yes' Drama album from 1980, and Whetton was an accomplished vocalist elsewhere. They would fuse their talents and come up with some of the most memorable songs of the 80's, and of all time. Songs like HEAT OF THE MOMENT, SOLE SURVIVOR, and ONLY TIME WILL TELL are classics to this day. These guys would stick around for several more years and albums, and wouldn't match the success of their first album. Still, they were a great band that put out some great music. 9/10"}

If this is their best cd, I wonder how terrible the others are.  mind alteringly dumb lyrics that are mindless pervade this cd, by the official \"prog rock supergroup.\"  supergroups tend to suck hard, and I would say that this band blows more than most.  Avoid at all costs, there is much better prog music out there.  I was previously a fan of the work these guys did in other bands before, and I am extremely dissappointed that something so aseptic could be brought forth by them.  Maybe they didn't have that much talent in the first place."}

It open with the beautifully nostalgic \"Chinese Cafe\" than launches right into the riff heavy sprawl of the title track. Touching on smooth & lovely jazz on numbers like \"Moon At The Window\" & \"Ladie's Man\" then switching back into rock & roll soul romps such as \"You Dream Flat Tires\" & \"You're So Square\". Other amazing moments include the melodic flipped-collar Vienna dreamscape of \"Underneath The Streetlight\" & the appropriately suave \"Be Cool\", & ending with the wonderful \"Love\" whichs rings true for everyone. She proclaims:\"Love suffers longLove is kind!Enduring all thingsLove has no evil in mindIf I had the gift of prophecyAnd all the knowledgeAnd the faith to move the mountainsEven if I understood all of the mysteriesIf I didn't have loveI'd be nothing.\"This is a wonderful expreimental album with fun & also introverted moments. It's well worth it! Highly recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The Eagles' drummer Don Henley released his second solo album,this one,in late 1984 after signing with Geffen Records. His solo debut,I CAN'T STAND STILL was released in 1982 on Asylum,the same label that the Eagles recorded on. Henley's fellow Eagle Glenn Frey was enjoying success as a solo artist as well. Eagles fans enjoyed Henley taking the lead on some of their hits like HOTEL CALIFORNIA,LIFE IN THE FAST LANE,THE LONG RUN,BEST OF MY LOVE and ONE OF THESE NIGHTS. On this hit album are the hits THE BOYS OF SUMMER,ALL SHE WANTS TO DO IS DANCE and SUNSET GRILL(Cher covered the latter). I also heard a cover of TBOS,but I don't remember the artist who covered it. Henley's next album,THE END OF THE INNOCENCE,released in 1989,was a much bigger hit."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Ah, the sound of those synthesized drums that were EVERYWHERE in 1984. If Orwell had his book to write over again, he'd warn us about the shelf life of those babies.  Musically, songs like the title track and \"Sunset Grill\" scream to you loud and clear exactly when they were made, but the album still hits home today.  With Walmart and various other corporations running the world, the lyrics of \"Sunset Grill\" are even more relevant today (and ironic, since the real location is now owned by a corporation!).  \"A Month of Sundays\" has got to be one of the most poignant songs I have EVER heard, and it could certainly apply to many industries besides farming.  \"The Boys of Summer\" still holds up as just about the best song from the 1980's, and \"Not Enough Love\" and \"You're Not Drinking Enough\" show us why Don just might be the best vocalist in all of popular music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Although several songs here haven't aged well, the majority of this album allows us to remember  the days of conspicuos consumption and moral bankruptcy that defined the 1980's. \"All She Wants To Do Is Dance\" is my favorite here: anyone who has ever traveled abroad and been embarresed in public by the rude, ignorant behavior of our countrymen will relate to this one! \"A Months Of Sundays\"  takes up the forgotten plight of America's farmers, whose suicide rate for a while, at least among males, rivaled that of Western Samoa! \"Drivin' With Your Eyes Closed\" sums up our politicians today as well as it did in 1984.  Henley writes for Americans who still read books, and stil believe that individual freedom is the last doorstop we have left before the door of government-imposed conformity slams our heads in its marble-encrustedframe.This is easily one of the top 10 American rock albums of the 1980's!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Soon I will have to replace this on cd-I have it on vinyl &amp; cassette &amp; played both til they nearly fell apart.  Every song is a gem, from the title track Building The Perfect Beast-great percussion throughout to  the rockin' All She Wants To Do Is Dance.  Once you pop this into your cd  or cassette player you'll want to hear it several times.  If you're not too  enamored of Don's latest cd(Inside Job)then this is the only cd you'll need  to get an idea of how brilliant his singing/songwriting really is."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Building The Perfect Beast was at the peak of music technology for 1984 and still sounds excellent today. Sunset Grill and Boys of Summer will live on as 80's all time rock classics. Don's lite rock is just as good as his  hard rock songs. Don always has great studio musicians backing him and has  an  all star lineup here. Danny Korchmar's guitar playing rocks throughout  the CD. David Paich and Michael Boddiker do excellent work on the  synthesizers; especially on Sunset Grill. Every song is good, if not great  on this album, plus Henley's lyrics always make his recordings worth a  listen."}

Whatever happened to him, anyway?Whitesnake jammed cuz they created good love ballads AND they made throbbing, groove-heavy metal hits, like the awesome &quot;Still of da Night&quot;.  Trust me, metal fans, you'll love each of these 9 songs.  If you get the chance, be sure to see an 80's Whitesnake video.  It's like Led Zeppelin re-formed and came back to do some heavy entertaining - with a great lookin' chick!!CHECK 'EM OUT!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This may not be their best album, but it's easily their most popular. The casual fan will find their biggest hits on here. This was released in 1987, and includes &quot;Still Of The Night&quot;, &quot;Is This Love&quot;, and the huge hit &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;. However most of the other tracks are nearly as good. &quot;Crying In The Rain&quot; and &quot;Children Of The Night&quot; are two other favorites. Overall they were one of the better hard rock/metal bands of the era, and had great taste in hood-ornaments too. Also better than &quot;Great White&quot;, and &quot;White Lion&quot;."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First there was Deep Purple's \"The House of Blue Light\" from January 1987, and then, \"Whitesnake\" [the album] from March 1987. Whitesnake's turned out to be the more popular album, maybe the most popular album of the year because of it's commercial appeal, and the music videos that helped to sell it, but make no mistake it's a really good album. But Deep Purple's was even better in my opinion, a far less commercial rock album who's videos were unfortunately banned by MTV, which helped keep it out of the Billboard top 20.Finally, I'm so tired of reading about the Whitesnake songs from this album being Led Zeppelin rip offs. Coverdale has already confirmed that a lot of the riffs come from Deep Purple rehearsal tapes back in the mid seventies when Coverdale was their lead singer. These riffs are \"borrowed\" from Ritchie Blackmore, not Jimmy Page. Case closed!I advise getting both of these great rock albums of 1987:*Whitesnake - Whitesnake*Deep Purple - The House of Blue Light"}

While Modern Day Cowboy, Gettin' Better and Little Suzi got the most  airplay in the late 80's, the rockers EZ Come EZ Go, Cumin' Atcha Live, 2  Late 4 Love and Rock Me to the Top can melt your eardrums and your  speakers. The two lighter but very good tunes are Changes and Love Me. The  other songs on the album are also respectable.Jeff Keith has a good,  raspy vocal delivery that he practiced while driving cement mixers. It's  easy to identify Tesla's work by his singing. Great guitar work by Frank  Hannon is another of Tesla's signature trademarks. While the Great Radio  Controversy and The Best of Tesla are both albums worth acquiring, this is  by far their best effort."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The diversity on \"Chalk Mark In a Rain Strom\" is simply wonderful. There's a good balance of politically charged beauties (The Reoccurring Dream, The Beat Of Black Wings, Cool Water, Etc.) & also endearing odes of love (My Secret Place, Snakes & Ladders, Etc.) She continues her use of synthesisers (Also heard on 1985's \"Dog Eat Dog\") which constructs gorgeous pieces such as the bittersweet synth bouquet of \"Lakota\" or the achingly beautiful \"The Tea Leaf Prophecy\" in which she brilliantly says in wonderful Joni fashion:\"Newsreels rattle the Nazi dreadThe able-bodied have shipped awayMolly McGee gets her tea-leaves readYou'll be married in a month they say\"These leaves are crazy!Look at this town there's no men left!Just frail old boys and babiesTalking to teachers in the treble clef\"Absolutly wonderful record. Brilliant lyrics & harmonies as usual. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Many (ignorant) people dismiss Joni's '80s work and don't even give it a chance. In my opinion, she has never made a weak album. Every single one is well crafted and well executed. Critics get caught up in comparing each album to the last one. Joni is a painter, and approches her music/albums the same way. Each one is a completely different piece that stands on it's own. She's never made the same album twice, and has never been afraid to experiment and take chances. This is a beautiful record. There are many duets with a wide range of people (Billy Idol, Willie Nelson, Peter Gabriel, etc.) I would recommend this or anything in the Joni catalog. She really amazes me with her consistant elegance and brilliance."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Here Joni's creative embers are glowing brightly again. Her languid voice is accorded poetic justice by the sparse backing on themes eternal - religious symbolism surfaces in Passion Play and Slouching Towards Bethlehem (an adaptation of a Yeats poem). The topic of growing old, gracefully treated in Nothing Can Be Done and Come In From The Cold, is brilliantly balanced by the teenage romance of Ray's Dad's Cadillac, in which Joni puts one over Rickie Lee Jones, one of her imitators. Savour these lines: \"Ray's dad teaches maths/I'm a dunce, a decimal in his class/When it comes to mathematics/I get static in the attic.\" Well, this is music - not maths - and Joni gets four out of five for composition and performance."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Edie Brickell and Company recorded one hit song \"What I Am\" which burst forth from the late 1980s college rock scene onto the pop charts and became inescapable on the radio.  It's also the tune that kicks off their debut album, the appropriately titled \"Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars,\" interesting now as an occasionally catchy period piece.  Brickell could be annoying as both a singer and a songwriter, but she followed up the hit with a few other decent tunes, including \"Little Miss S\" and \"Love Like We Do.\"  Elsewhere she comes off as an underage hippie relic who would have been more at home recording twenty years earlier.Overall, \"Rubberbands\" is interesting as a one hit rock period piece from the long gone college rock era."}

I think anyone would enjoy this, even those who normally wouldn't listen to happy hippie pop music, like myself. You can just see her spinning around in the grass singing when you listen to this. For those interested, she also has a 2003 solo release called &quot;Volcano&quot;, and she's still as cute as she sounds."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Of the two Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians (EBATNB) cds, 1988's  Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars (SRATS) is better than 1990's Ghost of a  Dog or Edie's 1994 solo effort. On SRATS, there are 12 consistent and  original songs with Edie's breathy vocals complimenting each one. The  music, lyrics and vocals are what make this a stand out cd. Sometimes the  first cd is the best from an artist and that would be accurate to say here.  It has the hits &quot;What I Am&quot; and &quot;Circle&quot; plus 8 other  tracks that are just as good. A must have for any rock collector."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Why do I say that?  It's because it encapsulates the decade better than any other did both musically and lyrically.  The 80s were, indeed, the end of the innocence for many, many of us.  In my case I got married, had kids, got divorced and changed careers at least 4 or 5 times.  The music fits every niche and cranny, from the metal edge of &quot;I will not go quietly&quot; to the satire of religion in &quot;Little Tin God&quot; and the failed materialism of &quot;Gimme what you got.&quot;  All summed up in the overture of the brilliant title cut and ending with the heartbreaking &quot;Heart of the matter.&quot;  To me there simply is no argument to make.  This is the best album of the 80s."}

This album may have been overshadowed by the release of better known (at the time) Def Leppard and their album &quot;Hysteria&quot;.

I also found &quot;paradise&quot; to be just as powerful. &quot;did it for the money&quot; is another fav of mine. I love the high energy of the album.

You hear her rock soul on this set, and yet you get diversity from a sort of country parody (&quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot;), a kind of gospel rock number (&quot;Heart of Stone&quot;), something tender (The duet with Peter Cetera: &quot;After All&quot;), to the adult contemporary &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;.Along the way, you'll incidentally hear song writer Diane Warren at her very best.  She writes quite well for Cher in this album, with songs that lend themselves to Cher's dramatic and rather sardonic delivery.All in all, if you're a new Cher fan, I think you'll be pleased with this, and if you're an old Cher fan, you should already have it."}

Although I really enjoyed Turbulent Indigo,Night Ride Home is special, moody, sad at times but itshows the real Joni Mitchell that overproduction sometimeshit with its colder touches(during the 80's). I still listened to everything Joni putout but this underappreciated collection of songs hit me just at a timein my life where I was reflecting about life and this musicfrom Joni really touched me.

Simply one of the most gorgeous CDs in her collection. It is wonderful to hear Joni's voice now, it is so different than back in the '70s... but it is definitely the same compelling, masterful instrument. As she has become older and her voice has deepened and grown a bit raspy, it has become downright haunting in places on this CD, like in \"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\" and my favorite \"Two Grey Rooms\". Supporting this unique voice which, though wisely not chasing the shattering highs of years gone by, is still precise and versatile, is Joni's surreal guitar and piano work. Supported by a smaller but familiar cast of expert musicians, \"NRH\" is one of the most beautiful, most mature, most objective CDs I've heard in a long time. It is so hard to believe it came out over 15 years ago!"}

There are more acoustic tracks who focus on Joni and her guitar. The lyrics are again from a very high level, like her albums from the 70's. Joni's voice has matured incredible and now you can hear that because of the sparse instrumentation. But that's not a complaint, because her voice sounds very cool and experienced by now. Absolute highlight of this album is Come In From The Cold, a song were Joni is looking back from the first time that she falls in love, to all the romance and relationships that have happened in her life. This is a great work from Joni Mitchell and if you love her more famous albums, you're gonna love this one also."}

She has a good voice that is never overdone behind somewhat-but-not-totally-gloomy guitars.  &quot;Kiss  them for me&quot; is really for me the oldest song I know by them, &amp;  I'm just now getting to know their older stuff.  &quot;Cities in Dust&quot;  &amp; &quot;This Wheel's on Fire&quot; have become my favorite tracks on  the cd.  Just be prepared to probably listen to the first half of the cd  over &amp; over before ever getting to the end of the cd, as that's what I  did."}

My eye's lid up to see a \"Siouxsie & The Banshees\" greatest hits sitting on the shelf.  My hand races out to pick it up in full anticipation of finding my favourite punk tune on there; \"spell bound\", and ugh!, I couldn't believe it.  This group finally releases a greatest hits here in Australia, and the best song is not even on it.  As good as a hot chocolate in winter, without the chocolate??."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Lisa Loeb's first major album with her band Nine Stories, titled TAILS, is an excellent album on so many levels. It's one of those CD's you can listen to anytime, and it just speaks mountains to you, or it makes you want to sing along with it. Lisa's first single &quot;Stay&quot;, which was on the Reality Bites soundtrack, was the first song to go to #1 by an independant artist who had no record label. It's also on TAILS. &quot;Do You Sleep&quot; is another winner. The instruments are used well in this album. Composing and performing songs that combine effervescent pop with the lyricism of a skilled storyteller, Lisa Loeb is one of contemporary music's most sumptuous delights. The CD has not even one filler track. Other highlights include &quot;It's Over&quot;, &quot;Snow Day&quot;, &quot;Rose Colored Times&quot;, &quot;Waiting For Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Alone&quot; and the ever poignant &quot;Hurricane&quot;. Check this out for something new!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In an effort to expand my collection of women's music I purchased this CD based solely on recommendations here. I have had no regrets! This CD is very good. It took several listens for me to get hooked but once that happened I have found myself reaching for this CD to play almost everyday. I was acquainted with two of the songs from the radio years ago: 'Stay' and 'Do You Sleep?' but others are just as good if not better. 'Snow Day' is high energy and I often play air guitar when nobody is watching. I will definately look into buying her other CD."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "Wu-Tang Clan is definitely one of the weirdest and most hilarious rap groups that ever existed, but that's also what makes them one of the greatest. They have a great sense of humor (as seen in their awesome Kung-Fu movie interludes), and GZA/Genius is a funny-yet-great rapper. He's not my favorite, but he's very very good (he seems friendly even though what he's talking about sometimes isn't). The beats here are fantastic, though I'm not sure who the producer actually was (I'm 50% sure it was GZA/Genius himself). The lyrics are always interesting and occasionally pretty funny - you'll definitely love listening to it all. Basically, if you're a rap fan or if you already like the Wu-Tang Clan then you're going to LOVE this album! Highly recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd is so damn grimey like crazy. Every track has the most dark/grimiest beat you can think of. Wow and is GZA a genius?? He writes better lyrics than anyone else in the damn Wu-Tang and he could rip up any other fake rapper out there any day! This cd is tight as sh*t!!!!It also has a tight ass CD cover. He has more of a laid back style of rapping, and he raps perfectly with these beats. The track LABELS is a classic, so check that one out. This album is known as one of the best solo wu releases, and let me tell you it is!!! So cop this wu fans!!!!Peace!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This could arguably be the best Wu-Tang solo album.  Once again, the RZA lays down his amazing beats for his fellow Clan-mate to glide over.  The GZA, who is probably the Clan's most gifted MC, drops jewels throughout this album (peep &quot;Labels&quot;).  This is my second favorite Wu-Tang album behind &quot;Only built 4 Cuban Linx&quot;.  Also, his second Wu album was O.K., but the &quot;Legend of The Liquid Sword&quot; is hot too.  As far as this CD goes, certified classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a CLASSIC. Right up there with Cuban Linx. What GZA lacks in persona he more than makes up for with his wicked intelligent deliveries. He exudes a veteran aura, someone who has been there an done that. GZA cuts right to the chase and gets down in the thick of it in this album. It has a dark and gloomy aesthetic feel to it, which I love. Yo, do yourself a favor and stop reading my review and just buy this sh**t. It is just as good now as it was back in '95...You won't regret it ;)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS STRAIGHT GRIMMEY FROM PRODUCTION,BEATS AND, LYRICS. BUT, LYRICALLY IT'S JUST SIMPLY PUT GENIUS. THE THOUGHTS PROCESS TO CREATE THIS ALBUM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IS PURE DARK BEAUTIFUL HIP HOP POETRY. THERES EXCELLENT GUEST VERSES FROM FELLOW CLANS MEN WHO BROUGHT THERE A* GAME TO THIS PROJECT. STANDOUT GUEST VERSES ON THIS RECORD ARE GHOSTFACE KILLAH ON 4TH CHAMBER. METHOD MAN ON SHADOWBOXIN' RAEKWON AND GHOSTFACE ON INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS. THE PRODUCTION FROM THE RZA AND BEATS ARE INCREDIBLE. YOU CAN PLAY THE WHOLE ALBUM WITHOUT SKIPPING 1 TRACK. PUT LIQUID SWORDS ON FOR ANYONE THAT HASN'T HEARD IT AND INSTANTLY BLOWS THEM AWAY."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Now in my rap dictionary, this is probably the best Cd from any other Wu-Tang solo artist. Like hus name, GZA is a pure Genius when it comes to making a solid CD like \"Liquid Swords\". I can go through evry song on here, and not skip one track. Thats how much I liked it. No matter what genre of music you enjoy, you can appreciate it. You will never find a group and artits liek Wu-Tang Clan and GZA. This CD just shows how much better music was back in the early 90's and mid 90's. The next time you are looking for a classic Cd's by oen of the Wu-Tang members, and you dont have this Cd, tehn by it. You will be amazed of how well done this Cd was. There will never be one like it, ever again.peace"}

On the other hand, The GZA's name really defines him - GENIUS.  This album is one of the greatest ever.  It's simply amazing, some of the illest beats you will ever here, with some of the tightest rapping and sick flow, plus tight LYRICS.  This album is really classic, i am addicted to it.  Best tracks are Investigative Reports, Shadowboxing (my favorite), Duel Of The Iron Mic, and Swordsmen, but every other song is a classic.  Get this if for some reason you haven't already.  This is hip-hop at its best."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The GZA is a lyrical swordsman. This guy says things that make you go back and think. This album, Liquid Swords, truly defines the classic Wu-Tang sound, just like the first Wu-Tang Clan album and the first Raekwon album before it. The GZA was at his absolute best on this album, and it shows in his lyrics. Here's the review:Album Highlights: The entire album.Production: Thumbs up. Once again, The Rza cooks up another production masterpiece.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: Other GZA albums after this have not lived up to this release. GZA released this at a good time in hip hop. Hip Hop music right now needs releases like this. Overall, this album is BRILLIANT. It's the classic Wu-Tang sound in all of its glory, and for that I strongly recommend that you purchase this album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "While every Wu-Tang solo release is noteworthy for one reason or another, this flawless solo LP from GZA is of special note because, to my ears, it captures The RZA at a creative peak, soundwise. These tracks are truly atmospheric and deep, and there are, thankfully, no outside contributions, every track here is pure RZA. While Inspectah Deck has a great guest shot on my favorite track, \"Cold World\" (can't you just listen to this song 1,000 times?) this is entirely GZA's showcase and his intricate, brilliant wordplay, while somewhat measured in places, is stunning from start to finish. There is no filler here and the album doesn't overstay it's welcome, it's simply perfect. A hip-hop classic."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "one of the reasons I love rap is for the visuals that some rhymes put in my mind.. more rappers can't than can give me good visuals.. GZA is one of the best at doing that for me and he is just a great rapper.  It's dark and scary sounding while at the same time pure hip hop. And everybody who guested on the album gives great visuals as well.  This album has such an incredible vibe to it.. Plus, RZA did some of his best work on this album. the beats go with the rapping perfectly. if you like Wu-Tang clan, you need to get this/"}

{"label": 9, "raw": "A missed track or two, but otherwise your basic &quot;best of&quot;. A good helping of songs from &quot;End of the Innocence&quot;, including the title track. Also important is &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, and &quot;Sunset Grill&quot;. My personal favorite would be &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; though. I just love the way that song starts out. His cover of Leonard Cohens &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; isn't bad, but it's hard to beat the original. The new songs are good, just not &quot;greatest hits&quot; good. The only thing that could make this any better, is if it was released in 2002 so it could include &quot;Everything is Different Now&quot; from &quot;Inside Job&quot;. That's his last greatest hit."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I always liked the Eagles, but I love Don Henley.  He has the smoothest of voices and his songs are fantastic.  This cd comprises some great hits that we all know and love.  The one song I'd like to see here (which obviously couldn't be on it because it was written and released after this was made) is Taking You Home.  That's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  Other than that, there is Dirty Laundry, End Of The Innocence and New York Minute for us to enjoy.  I love this cd and I love Don Henly.  This is a must for any fan of his."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "When The Eagles broke up in the 1980's, two members landed outstanding solo projects. One of them was Don Henley. Actual Miles blends all three of his studio albums, into one great package. The songs feature his hits Sunset Grill, and The Heart Of The Matter. It also features three new tracks.The Garden Of Allah, is the so-called sequel to Hotel California. I thought it was even more frightening and enjoyable, than its prequel. You Don't Know Me At All brings classic rock and excitement in its depths of hard core Henley fanatics. Everybody Knows is a remake of a Lenord Cohen tune. This song was off the 1995 album Tower Of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen.While fans still look foward to his songs with The Eagles, Don Henley proved to break down the walls, and tell haunting and understanding stories of pop music in each of our lives. It is not the end of the innocence. It still is continuing on."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First off, let me say just how much I LOVE the lay-out art work on this CD release (hubba-hubba!). They used several full color adult pin-ups from (would have to be)the late '60's era. I must also admit that I may like this disc better than I do their 'Astro-Creep: 2000' mostly because it has a diverse sound on just about every tune. Totally dug the after dark mix of \"Electric Head Pt. 2\", the raw mix of \"Grease Paint And Monkey Brains\" and the ass-kicking wine, women and song mix of \"Blood, Milk And Sky\" the most. Great compilation CD."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Usually re-mixes bore the hell outta me and for the most part I don't see the point? If you have a good cd/song, why mess with it? Why take good songs and destroy them completely? Examples, Yes and Queen re-mixes come to mind just off the top of my head as really bad attempts at this. Anyway this is not the case here. Sure their are a few short comings, but for the just cranking it up at parties factor this cd rocks and the girl's a nice touch as well.Overall a decent attempt that deserves some notice."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Alright here's the deal, I bought this cd with an open mind.  I understand black sabbath switched lead singers and so did ac/dc and alot of other bands and they still put out great music with both frontmen.  Im not saying its not possible, it just didnt happen with the misfits.  i bet with sabbath and ac/dc other bands members helped with writing the music, but with the fits, glenn wrote ALL OF IT!  the lyrics and the music...he even taught some of the members how to play their instruments.  so guess what happens when glenn leaves?  uh-oh...now the band has to write music for itself and try and stand on its own two feet.  this stuff isnt terrible, there are a couple decent tracks on here, but its a totally different band with a totally different sound.  i hope glenn will forgive me for buying this...it sux."}

Jerry & Doyle can actually play their instruments now and being backed by Dr. Chud's thundering drums and Michale Graves haunting screams really gives the band a great heavy, full sound.The stand-out songs are: \"Speak of the Devil\", \"Dig Up Her Bones\", \"Crimson Ghost\", \"Day of the Dead\" and \"Don't Open Til Doomsday\".Also, the hidden track \"Hell Night\" is pretty catchy.This is a great album in it's entirety, but the \"resurrected\" Misfits didn't really find their own sound until \"Famous Monsters\" which is definitely their best.Buy this album and prepare to shout along."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;American Psycho&quot; introduced the &quot;new&quot; version of the Misfits which included original bassist Jerry Only, longtime guitarist Doyle, and new members drummer Dr. Chud and singer Michale Graves.  Graves' voice bears a stunning resemblance to that of Glenn Danzig's, but the band as a whole suffers without Danzig's writing and musical talents.  However, &quot;American Psycho&quot; is much better than it is given credit for by longtime fans.  The album is chock full of catchy hooks and B-grade horror movie lyrics, and the rhythm section of the band has grown and Graves' voice sounds fantastic.  Standout tracks include the title track, &quot;From Hell They Came&quot;, &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;, &quot;Hate the Living, Love the Dead&quot;, and the excellent &quot;Dig Up Her Bones&quot;.  All in all, longtime fans may not dig &quot;American Psycho&quot; or any of the newer material bearing the Misfits name, but all together this is a solid album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This CD is definetely a must own for any Misfits fan/fiend/whatever. Released in 1997, this CD features classics such as \"Dig Up Her Bones\", \"Mars Attacks\", \"Shining\", and \"Black Light\". Okay, so Michale Graves' can't sing as well as Danzig. But, hey. Not many Punk vocalists can sing better than Danzig. Michale's aggressive howls and cries sound well blended in with sharply-tuned guitars and bass. The drums are also decent. Pick this one up along with Famous Monsters."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Lisa Loeb's second album, Firecracker has 12 great tracks but some of the songs took awhile to grow on me but songs I loved right away include: Falling in Love, Jake, I Do, Let's Forget About It, Truthfully, Furious Rose,This and How. Loeb has a beautiful and rich voice, her lyrics are poetic and haunting. From the song Falling in Love, \"The gray sky was romantic 'cause he was holding her hand, he was her man, the time between meeting and finally leaving is sometimes called falling in love.\" The title-track gives me the chills, the chorus is amazing. Truthfully is such a gentle and sweet song, so much better than I thought it was, \"You showed up with your parachute...\" If you like deep, meaningful, and poetry-like lyrics then Firecracker is for you."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A fine singer-songwriter with a sweet, candy-coated voice that belies the 29 years old that she was when she made this album, Lisa Loeb first hit big with the song \"Stay\" from her 1995 album \"Tails,\" and established herself as a talented and heartfelt lyricist. This album, in my opinion, is best carried by songs like \"I Do\" and \"Falling In Love,\" which have sunny guitars and her most cheerful, upbeat singing, but even dark, brooding selections like \"Furious Rose\" and \"Jake,\" are beautifully written and sang with sincere, lilting angst."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I don't know of a more beautiful song than Lisa Loeb's 'How'.  It is perfect, brilliant and captivating.  I love every inch of it.  &quot;Firecracker&quot; is Lisa's second album and it does a great job.  Some of the songs I don't see fit for this album but most of the songs do the CD justice.  I love Lisa's vocals and acoustic sound.  The opener 'I Do' is also an amazing song, especially for an opener."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a great sophomore effort from Lisa Loeb. You will find Lisa experimenting with strings/orchestra arrangements which adds a certain quality to the CD that isn't found on the first album, \"TAILS.\" This CD was one that grew on me. The more you listen to the songs and hear all the production and work that went into each track, you appreciate it more and more! You realize why it was nominated for a Grammy for \"best engineered album - non classical\" or whatever they call the category! Be on the look out for Lisa Loeb's new, THIRD album, \"CAKE AND PIE\" ... In my opinion, it is one of her best CD's so far! \"EAT YOUR VEGETABLES NOW BECAUSE DESSERT IS ON ITS WAY!\""}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I had to get this CD again, after first having had it on vinyl well over a decade ago.Believe it or not, I can remember well a number of the tracks, despite not having heard them this whole time.'Static' in  particular sticks out for me.  A haunting rendition of moody,  post-holocaust science fiction, one can almost feel the desolation in the  atmosphere.  If you ever have to contemplate nuclear war and its mind  boggling aftermath, you should do so while listening to this song!Just  thinking of Planet P Project gets my creative imaginative juices flowing.  I used to curl up with a good science fiction novel with this on the  stereo-- and nothing has been quite the same since."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "PLANET P is a great progressive rock/pop album recorded mostly by singer/multi-instrumentalist/songwriter Tony Carey. Unlike his albums under his own name, which are more pop-oriented and rooted in bands such as Survivor, Shooting Star, and Asia, this one sounds a great deal like the Alan Parsons Project and features extended pieces. Carey sings lead on all but one song here, and the lyrics explore a theme that would be even more pronounced on Planet P's follow-up, PINK WORLD: anxiety over Albert Einstein's work with nuclear physics being used to eliminate the human race. The songs here describe the fears of the Cold War generations, and anyone who was a teenager or adult before glasnost should own this CD."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Something brilliant. That's exactly what happens when you turn Cher into nothing short of a rock Goddess, and mix her with Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and Desmond Child. Aswell as these HOT producers, there's also production from Michael Bolton, Peter Asher and Jon Lind. This is honestly one of Cher's best ever albums. All of the tracks are brilliant, but my favourites are obviously the ones produced by Jon, Richie and Desmond!! (We All Sleep Alone, which is my favourite Cher song ever, Bang-Bang, Main Man, Give Our Love A Fightin' Chance, Perfection and Working Girl, though I really like I Found Someone, too!) I love them all! :)I think her later work is also great (Believe, Living Proof, etc...), though she should've stuck to Jon, Richie and Desmond! ;)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "My favoutite albums by Cher are her Geffen-albums, made between 1987 and 1992. It's this one, &quot;Heart Of Stone&quot; and &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (and the &quot;Greatest Hits 1956-1992&quot;, containing three new songs).  If you like any of the songs you've heard from these albums, you should buy  all of them, because they are great. They sound quite the same, but are  still, by some reason, very different. Diane Warren, Desmond, Child, Jon  Bon Jovi and Michael Bolton have written many of the songs on these albums  and they are great songwriters.  Buy this album, you'll love it! I like the  guita solos (some of them by Steve Lukather (Toto) or Richie Sambora (Bon  Jovi))."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd heralds a few choice cuts. They include &quot;We All Sleep  Alone&quot;, and &quot;Dangerous Times&quot;. Here Cher is moving and  dramatic. Her second two lps on Geffen were superior though, and &quot;Skin  Deep&quot; and &quot;Working Girl&quot;, are compositions that should never  have been selected. Cher has improved as a singer since this cd.Some will  love it for the hit &quot; I Found Someone&quot;, penned by Michael Bolton,  origional version by Laura Branigan. Cher cut the hit though.Not a bad  listen but Cher can be better.Chers first version of &quot;Bang Bang&quot;,  is much better in its' Sonny Bono Harold Battiste production. This one is  garish and hard."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Man! can you belive the price? Jimmy toured on this lp. And it wasgreat! The opening song was WASTING MY TIME. Sad though thateverything he does is compared to Zeppelin:-( Three instramentals included. Robert pops in on THE ONLY ONE. Good job Bob! PRISON BLUES starts off with a wicked overdriven blues riff that just screams all the way through to the other side of your skull,man!  HUMMINGBIRD is light mix radio stuff. BLUES ANTHEM is probably the only song ever by Jimmy I dare call boring. After the FIRM (who were great!) and before COVERDALE.(also great!)  OUTRIDER stands on it's own as testament to a man &amp; his guitar, against the world!  Still cant belive the price? Should be $18.00 or more. Get it now before they get wise! Only question Jimmy,Who cut your hair,man?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I'm not sure how I missed this album when it first appeared. I was in graduate school at the time and not buying many albums. Maybe that explains it. Anyway, there are some great tunes here. &#34;The Only One,&#34; a blistering reunion with Robert Plant, is the first one that jumps out. &#34;Prison Blues,&#34; with Chris Farlow on vocals, is a stellar blues guitar workout. Then there's &#34;Blues Anthem,&#34; again with Farlow, to close out the album. These are the most obvious highlights, but there isn't a bad tune here. Highly underrated."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If the Plimsouls' Everywhere At Once is supposed to be New Wave, I just can't hear it. These twelve cuts sound like Rockabilly, and lackluster Rockabilly at that. The Stray Cats have done this stuff to death. There's an oh-too-familiar sameness to it all: the fast tempo gets boring. And the pedestrian drumming grates on my nerves. The work of the Plimsouls is interchangeable with that of the Go Go's, only the Go Go's are cuter, but just as banal. No doubt, Peter Case is a talented lyricist and musician, but the never ending Rockabilly gimmick wears thin."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Originally released in 1983, who could honestly forget this fun-to-listen-to new wave, power pop, alternative (call it what you like) band? Guess they disbanded after this record came out. Never one of my favorites but I remember this lp on the turntable at several college parties I hung out at back then. Tunes here I found to my liking were \"Shaky City\", the catchy \"Lie, Beg, Borrow And Steal\", their unforgettable 'signature' song {if you care to call it that} \"A Million Miles Away\", \"My Life Ain't Easy\", \"I'll Get Lucky\" and the surf guitar-like closer \"Hobo\". Nice! Followers of the Romantics, Goo Goo Dolls, The dB's and The Knack should really enjoy this reissue."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "You Gotta Sin To Get Saved is a good album from former Lone Justice leader Maria McKee. She's a \"real\" musician and songwriter, not a record company product. She could sing the phone book and I'd listen to that voice. I like this solo release about a smuch as the first LJ album but not as much as Shelter. I'm not sure where this release falls in her solo career, if it was her 2nd, 3rd, 4th solo album...It's good music. If you like talented female musicians on the mellow side, this is a good CD. Sort of in the style of 10,000 Maniacs but better than Natalie Merchant.Standout track: I'm Gonna Soothe You"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Maria soothes the soul with this, her second solo album. Backed by the Jayhawks and old-friends from her Lone Justice days, she rips through the songs--some originals, some cover versions--with abandon. For proof, listen to \"I'm Gonna Soothe You,\" which basically wraps you in its warmth. \"My touch is gentle, my body is warm ...\" she sings, stepping out from the speakers. She's sexy, saucy, inviting and sweet all at once; and envelops you with her passion. Further proof: Her wondrous remake of the Goffin-King classic \"I Can't Make It Alone\"; and her raucous ode to her Lone Justice days, \"My Girlhood Among the Outlaws.\" A true classic - and for $7, a no-brainer. Buy it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is most definitely a classic album from Maria. In fact, it's her best. I am sorry that it hasn't received more recognition from the new country community, but that's how the cards fall sometimes. Everything from the sweet memphis sound of &quot;I'm gonna soothe you&quot; to the bittersweet &quot;Only Once&quot;, is a showcase for the endless talents of Ms. Mckee. Like most of the alt-country she was bred on the punk sound of the eightees and traditional folk music that was ignored at the time. Her only misfortune was bad timing. The decade of Van Halen and Poison would have had a difficult time appreciate a work of art in this vein. If you like Chrissie Hynde and/or Janis Joplin, this album is perfect for you."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt is highly overrated. The songs released were pretty good but after all these years, this album is dated and annoying now. This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular, no wonder they had to change their sound after this album. Don't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it. The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning, great hook and chorus. This album is considered their masterpiece, but I've heard better."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought this album after hearing (and loving)&quot;Spiderwebs&quot; and &quot;Don't Speak&quot; on the radio. I fell in love with it the first time I heard it. The only song that is not too good is &quot;World Go Round&quot;, but all the other songs are just too good to drag the record along. My other faves on the album include &quot;Sixteen&quot;, &quot;Different People&quot; and the title track. Sadly, thier other albums can't compare to this one. If you only buy one No Doubt album, this is it! This is one of the best CD's I own (Melanie B.'s &quot;Hot&quot; is the other)and I absolutely adore it. Get ready for a great ride through a &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;!!:)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No Doubt's TRAGIC KINGDOM is a classic album from the mid 90s. It has a unique sound that no one else was making at the time. There is a unique mix of reggae, punk, and pop found on this album. I remember how huge it was at the time. It has really aged well...10 years on and it's still a very listenable album. Singles included \"Just A Girl\", \"Spiderwebs\", \"Sunday Morning\", \"Don't Speak\", and \"Excuse Me Mister\". The album has a whole is great and there is no filler! Classic!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The breakthough effort of ska meets 1940's &quot;No Doubt&quot; is - without a doubt - an incredible album.  Full of wonderful melodies, and other delicious musicalities, &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; offers music  lovers everywhere a taste of that California sunshine!  Led by Gwen  Stefani, &quot;No Doubt&quot; sizzles with hit singles &quot;Don't  Speak&quot; , &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot; and so much  more.  Other swinging and equally notable songs include the melodramatic  &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, the roudy &quot;Happy Now&quot;, and the  anthem-esque &quot;The Climb&quot;.  Stefani's voice is truly a unique and  powerful instrument, belting it's way into mainstream, backed by the  talented stylings of other members Tony, Adrian, and Tom.  &quot;Tragic  Kingdom&quot; is a great little album, really different from anything else  with its spunk, style, and spirit."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No Doubt is one of the few bands who improves with each album.! Gwens vocals are far less whiny on this album,and the lyrics are more serious then their debut.!Althou their debut was a flop for them I *Love* it you should check that out as well.!This album spawned such major hits as &quot;Don't Speak&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, and &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;.!Which brought this ska band to super stardon they sold over 10 million copies of this album.! I bought this album without hearing a single song from it.!And I am proud to say I was NOT disapointed it is actually a good album.!If you are looking for something that is not over produced and more original then Britney Spears then check out No Doubt's &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;!!! The best songs here are &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Don't Speak&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Excuse me Mr.&quot;, &quot;Sweet 16&quot;, and &quot;Different People&quot;.!But that's just my opinions!!!Just check out this album!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Up until \"Tragic Kingdom\", Ska/Pop type music was unheard of in the mainstream.  After the release of the song \"Just a Girl\", all of that changed.  It opened the floodgates for a wide variety of bands with horns.Back around 1995, when this album was released was when I actually liked Gwen Stefani.  Her voice was excellent (has gone downhill since), and she just had an attractive energy about her.  She was the single reason why No Doubt surfaced on the scene.This album, Tragic Kingdom, was a masterpiece.  I can listen all the way through, without skipping a song.  Standout songs are, \"Just a Girl\", \"Spiderwebs\", \"Sunday Morning\", \"Don't Speak\", \"Happy Now\", and \"Different People\".A must have!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album made NxD famous. It made Gwen Stefani into a star.The first four tracks on the album set the scene. The whole album is represented by those tracks.The rest of the album is amazing, but some of the songs go over your head. But that just gives this album more replay value.I hope NxD release their new album soon. Till then fans, myself included, have \"Tragic Kingdom\" and the acclaimed \"Rock Steady\" to tide them over.Favorite tracks: \"Spiderwebs,\" \"Excuse Me Mr.\" \"Just a Girl,\" \"Happy Now?\" \"Sunday Morning,\" \"Don't Speak\""}
{"label": 9, "raw": "No Doubt beared platinum fruit with this delectable collection of charttoppers and sparkling So Cal/ska-meets-punk-meets-pop. This is an incredible album which showcases the amazing versatility of each member of the group and highlights Gwen's incredibly expressive and confessional songwriting. This album just gets you jumping up and down, and happy. With sing-a-longable songs and irrepresibly irrestible rhythms, how could you go wrong? They stay in your head and they make you happy. Perfect music for listening to on the freeway an hour before dusk. Ascension-like. Very recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd, which richly deserved its diamond status, brought ska and No Doubt to the peak of popularity.  While the ska fever has died down, this album and band remain vital in the music scene.  This album is, for the most part, a happy affair.  Gwen Stefani is for this band what Christine McVie is for Fleetwood Mac, someone who can make bouncy songs even about depressing subjects.  Anyway, this album is fantastic.  The title track descends into a cacaphony of clashing instruments, and other tracks, such as &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; and &quot;The Climb&quot; are also spectacular.  If you don't own this album now, what are you waiting for?  Buy it, listen to it, and love it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Though not a fan of much ska or hard rock music, this is a band I can't help loving. Beautiful, brilliant, thoughtful, creative and expressive, the sister and brother team of Gwen and Eric Stefani come together with three of their friends to create an album that knocked the socks off of everyone in the industry.From the satire in &quot;I'm Just A Girl&quot; to the metaphorical &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; &quot;Excuse Me Mister,&quot; &quot;Sixteen,&quot; and &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; the album displays what a rock band should be able to do. It's not just five people screaming about leprechauns only know what, it's five people dealing with problems of life- coming of age, discrimination, and unpleasant relationships. No candied apples or rainbows for this one of a kind band, only life experiences are expressed on No Doubt's debut album &quot;Tragic Kingdom.&quot; A must-own for anyone who loves music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I listened to this for the first time in a long time recently and was pleasantly surprised at how good it sounds.This is the ultimate No Doubt album - terrific sound of ska/new wave/pop.  Listening to this album again during our present penchant for 80's revival made me realize that \"Tragic Kingdom\" was about 10 years ahead of it's time.\"Spiderwebs\", \"Excuse Me Mr\", \"Just A Girl\", \"Sunday Morning\" and \"Don't Speak\" are all great singles.Hopefully this band will truly return to their great roots and return to this fine form in the near future...I think it's the perfect time!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I just love Tragic Kingdom it has to be the best No Doubt album to date. It has four great singles Spiderweb, Just A Girl, Sunday Morning, and Don't Speak. This has to be the best album of the 90's and of '95 if you ask me. The whole album is a true rock album so don't think twice about getting this album because you might just miss out on a great thing. If you are looking for a great rock album it has to be No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom. Put this one in your collection today or you might miss out on a real true rock album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of the best CD's I have. But I think that they did a better job at their new album, return of saturn. Tragic Kingdom was released in 1995, and now it is 2001, so people still listen to their 6 year ago songs. NO DOUBT'S SONGS NEVER GET OLD!!!!!!THIS BAND ROCKS!!!!!!!I just keep loving their songs more and more and more,,,,and I am sure that I will still keep listening to TRAGIC KINGDOM EVEN IF I HAD IT FOR 6 YEARS NOW....  You are doing great guys....KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK!!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Not knowing anyone who doesn't own this, or love this, is not surprising. Tragic Kingdom is what brought No Doubt up the charts, with the classic ska ballad Don't Speak. A lot happend to the band during this album including the band's jealousy of Gwen being the only one noticed. As you listen, you can actually hear the true closeness this band has. This album in particular heads toward a rock-edge, with enough trumpets to explode the sound system. What makes Tragic Kingdom noteworthy is the bands adorable, yet rock-hard tune, and the incredible, fun-loving band itself."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "With some exceptions, I think TD's music from the 70's is horrible. But not all of it. Ricochet is good and the song Green Desert I still think stands as one of their best. By my standards, Hyperborea is one of the best things they ever did. The sound is lucid and not a jumble of crazy, unrelated noises like I have experienced on some of their other recordings. Christopher Franke was still with the band and for my money, Tangerine Dream was one half Froese and one half Franke. The songs on this CD move well and are truly creative and original although you still have the same distinctive sound. With Franke gone TD is just not what it used to be. Every song here is good and the 20 minute \"Sphinx Lightning\" is the kind of stuff Tangerine Dreams are made of. The gradual changing of rhythms on this album is what makes it unique. Hyperborea, from 1983, still has to be one of their best."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Massive Attack's first album, BLUE LINES, was an exciting and novel release that offered a range of superb tracks that didn't let the listener down. Four years later, Massive Attack released PROTECTION, and this trip-hop band tripped up a little.PROTECTION nowhere offers the consistency that BLUE LINES did, and many of the songs are rather weak, especially the title track and &quot;Three.&quot; The last track, a live performance of The Doors' &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, seems pretty out-of-place.However, there are a couple of great tracks which stop this from being a bad album, the ganja-influenced &quot;Eurochild&quot; and &quot;Karmacoma,&quot; and the ambient &quot;Heat Miser.&quot; This songs make the album listenable, but somewhat disappointing all in all.Happily, Massive Attack's next release, 1998's MEZZANINE, is one of the best rock albums ever, and regains the perfection (surpasses it, in fact) of BLUE LINES."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "as usual, i order a cd like 'protection' for a song or two.  then i get a great surprise.in this case, it's the title track, with vocals by tracey thorn.  thorn, along with lisa gerrard, dusty springfield, doris day, billie holiday, aretha franklin and a few others, has a uniquely gorgeous voice and styling that is immediately identifiable for so many things--a social scene, a certain era, a mood.unlike the others, she has still to get her due and fame as a singer.  here's hoping that people will use her and get her heard as much as the law will allow."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a terrific album dating from 1995. Massive Attack use many different vocalists and instrumentalists, and the overall style is slowish urban 90's music with beguiling rhythms and cool voices. It is well produced and quite sophisticated. The title track Protection is one of my all-time favourite tracks by anybody. Tracey Thorn from Everything But The Girl sings this excellent song. Other ones I like are the slow groove Heat Miser and the unusual rhythm of Karmacoma, which I grew to like . There's a live recording of Light My Fire, which proves that Massive Attack are a good live attraction as well as being great in the studio. I listen to this album frequently and I can strongly recommend it to any people who like great music."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Massive Attack has paved the way for all trip-hoppers and electronica artists.  They masterfully out-do themselves on every album (with their best album therefore being Mezzanine) and with slow songs, gradual climaxes, and heavy beats, its irresistable to an electronica fan.  There is no question that the best song on the album they put first, the title track, Protection.  Its a sweet song, with tracey thorn's smooth vocals (I cant change the way you feel, but i can put my arms around you) with a great guitar riff and the classic massive attack beats, at more than 6 minutes long.  No downtempo collection is complete without at least one massive attack record- and the rest of the album is pretty good- but the whole album is worth it for just that one song."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I bought this CD after being exposed to Nicolette's amazing vocals on Plaid's amazing \"extork\". On \"Protection\" she sings \"Three\" and \"Sly\". These songs are fine (the music's a little snoozy) but her underground solo work is generally better.  The other tracks range from dull to downright irritating.  Sounding hodgepodged, there is no common style nor theme to this album.I even bought Massive Attack's \"No Protection\"remixes hoping for better luck as well as different takes of the Nicolette tracks (so I can cut and paste my own remixes on my MD player).  Well,  her voice isn't even ON that disc, and as a whole the music was even LESS memorable.Perhaps Massive Attack, though seemingly popular, just isn't for me.  Maybe they just aren't strange and distinctive enough to suit my tastes.  ..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have always been a fan of Scarface since his first album. His aggressive stlye of rapping plus the social commentary puts him above the average rapper from the south. This second album has a lot of gems in it which are COMIN AGG, THE WALL, LETTIN EM KNOW, LET ME ROLL, YOU DONT HEAR ME DOE, DYING WITH YOUR BOOTS ON, NOW IF FEEL YA(deep old school classic), MR SCARFACE PART 3 FINAL CHAPTHER, HE'S DEAD and IM BLACK(deep record about police brutality). Filler: Still that n***a, Strictly For The Funk Lovers(stupid filler wher they pretty much say doodoochaser all over the record) and Funky Lil N***a(the little boy so wack its sidesplitting hilarious. Bottom Line: The World Is Yours is a classic that is that any Scarface fan will enjoy. Scarface's raps are still on point, the production was solid and he gave you a little insight on certain tracks.

If you think you know hardcore hip-hop and u don't own this album.....WHERE HAVE U BEEN!!!The beats are so dark and hard that it would bury the average \"gangsta rapper\" trying to flow over them. But put that boy Brad (Scarface) up to the task and he tames them. Every song (yes i mean every) is a must listen. There are no interludes or shout out trks on here to be found. This is not just mindless \"gangsta rap\" this is Harcore Hip-hop at its finest..Hotep!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is real tight.I decided to buy this album because I heard the Luniz on my homie Dru Downs album explict game, back in 94'.I liked they rap so I got this joint, and I wasn't disappointed either.I mean the Luniz ain't as good as Dru Down but they good enough to listen to.This album features  Dru Down,Richie Rich,Shock G and others.The Beats on this joint is real tight nice and smooth grooves to ride to.The lyrics is what separates the Luniz from anybody else in the rap game thoy.Them fools be saying the funniest stuff you can think of and they just make it sound real tight in they street based raps.So if you like WestCoast music like me you'll like this and if you wanna get a good laugh this the one for you too no doubt."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I got 5 on it. Every one knows that songs. I got this when I was heavey on the bay sound in 95. This album is the bomb and its kind of funny to, because of the slangs words they use and their clever wordplay. Just listen to song 13 where they use the barney songs chourus lyrics. THey have pimp songs,dance songs, smoke songs. I like song 6 the best ,its smooth. This is the begging of yukmouths career he went solo after the luniz broke up and he hot. He isnt a to comical now though  he is more  gangsata now. Check him out also. Get the luniz too."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Hey this is the first cd from the luniz, you might know them from that song, i got 5 on it. I bought this cd, basically because of that song, and thats all i got. i was hoping for a LITTLE more, maybe just one or two other good songs, but it wasnt happenening. The reason this gets a 3 star instead of 1 or maybe 2, is because the song, i got 5 on it, is such a good song, you could put it on a barbara striesand cd, and i would still give it a 3 stars, just for that one song. Go buy the cd, or the single of i got 5 on it, if they have it, just for that song, cuase you really need to hear that song."}

A tight Horrorcore song on this track is I Just Wanna Die by that psycho Bushwick Bill, and the Hard-Thuggish Ruggish hit Niggas And Flies done by Willie D & Scarface!

I was listening to \"Six Underground\" the very 1st song I ever heard and I liked it so I listened to more of the music and I thought to myself not bad.  Kelli Dayton has a very soulful voice yet a bit to edgy, I am not saying shes bad but sometimes she sounds like a kid. Shes a good singer though. Chris Corner and Liam Howe wrote some very good songs.Chris Corner is a better singer then Kelli Dayton, I mean dont get me wrong shes great but Corner was a bit better, this is a alright album so I gave it a 3."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Once I picked up &quot;Becoming X&quot;, I felt like I became one of the lucky people who knew this for more than just the great single &quot;6 Underground&quot;. If you liked that song, most of the others are as good. &quot;Low Place Like Home&quot; and &quot;Spin Spin Sugar&quot; I like just as much. My favorite though is &quot;Post-Modern Sleaze&quot;. It consists of this odd combination of acoustic guitar and trip-hop beats, but works really well. Sweet lyrics too. Then the next-to-last song &quot;How Do&quot; is nice and mezemorizing. Some people say this disc sounds dated, but isn't everything? I still play it often."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;Becoming x&quot; sounds today a bit dated,mostly because trip-hop genre was specified long ago.That is true,Sneaker pimps sound unique on &quot;Bloodsport&quot; and also on &quot;Splinter&quot; but their popular debut is not showing at all their skills.The fact is that Trip-hop was something original then and now Snekaer Pimp's on here are sounding like something between the band's like Garbage,Massive atack and Portishead.&quot;6 underground&quot;,&quot;Tesko suicide&quot;,&quot;Waterbaby&quot;,&quot;Spin spin sugar&quot; or &quot;Roll on&quot; are combinig electronic beats with some guitars and Kelli's sweet vocals (she is singing here instead of Chris Corner who plays here on guitars).but all these songs are just good.listen to it without any excitment.there are few gems here like &quot;Low place like home&quot;, &quot;Walking zero&quot; or amazing &quot;How do&quot; but all in all &quot;Becoming x&quot; is nothing more like another trip-hop album.I enjoyed their other albums a lot.this one is featuring some fine tracks but is not impressing at all."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I thought Sneaker Pimps really had something going when I first heard &quot;6 Underground&quot;, but then when I heard the rest of the CD, I was very glad that I didn't buy the CD and just heard someone else's copy of it.  The songs are nothing like &quot;6 Underground&quot; and are lacking in both originality and artistic talent.  Not a good buy.  If you bought the CD, then you probably find yourself skipping through the entire CD and listening to the last song which was a remix by another artist.  The original is almost terrifying.  The rest of the CD is just garbage."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I am a big fan of most all types of techno. The Sneaker Pimps aren't the exception. With a hot lead singer who can sing with a band who make sounds basically, it makes me addicted at some points. The title track, Becoming X is my personal favorite because it reminds me of something Moby would make.On the other hand, Spin Spin Sugar sounds completely different on the CD from its version on the radio. It's much more longer and weirder. She cries at one part of the song. Then she starts laughing. 6 Underground is a perfect song which I still push repeat on. The remix(track 12) wasn't really needed because the only difference is adding the &quot;What's up witchu&quot; part in the background."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The very first time I've listened to this album, I thought my player got broken or the CD was scratched, but then I listened again afterwards and noticed that it was actually the real sound of Daft Punk. No strings attached.After a few more times of listening and deep-diving it, I suddenly found myself hooked to the loops and beats of what could be considered the best Daft Punk album ever. A risky project which turned into quite a good electronic/house classic, as good for workout as it is for partying.Weird samples, extreme loops, mad beats and several other bizarre sounds made this album an essential if you're in it for electronic.\"Around the World\" is a true all-time gem, for sure.Strongly not recommended for \"Easy Listening\" or \"Adult Contemporary\" fans."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Perhaps to figure out how any listener would react to owning this album, it's important to gauge how and why you play most of your albums.  Homework is a breakthrough and a true original, bringing the DJ dancehall spirit into an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink experiment in sonic trailblazing.  Still, in the six years or so I've owned Homework, I've listened to it only a handful of times.  I think it lacks the essential qualities of the other great records of the techno explosion in the late 90's - the grand drama of DJ Shadow's Endtroducing..., the spunky accessibility of Chemical Brother's Dig Your Own Hole, or, to go a bit later, the go for broke propulsion of Basement Jaxx's Remedy.  If the originality of the music is enough for you, it certainly is here in spades, but it's hard to deny this record is distancing at best and forgettable at worst."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "To think that it is nearly 10 years since this was released is incredible. I remember being freaked out by the Da Funk video with the talking dog and the video for Around The World was a clever piece of videowork. But anyway, it's incredible to think that after nearly a decade in circulation, it has aged well.Despite, the previous two that I mentioned ( which have gone on to be dancefloor classics ), the rest of the album is just as good with particular mentions to Indo Silver Club and Alive. Alive in particular, sounds very claustrophobic. Really gets you going. Still worth it after all these years."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a fun record... anyone buying this record looking for salvation will probably be disappointed, but if you want a fun, funky, dance record, then this is it... I love it personally, and it always hypes me up when I listen to it... just listen to the wicked... beats on Revolution 909, the soothing waves on Fresh, the funky bass of Around the World, the discoy feel of High Fidelity... it's great fun, and if you like dance music, you need this in your collection... if you like music you need it, for some variety... it's great fun, pick it up..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Okay, so I have to admit it.  I own this CD.  I do listen to it from time to time, but that is becoming rare.  The beats were fun and maybe it was just the crazy video for &quot;Around The World&quot; that got me interested.  But enough is enough.  In &quot;Da Funk&quot;, how many times can you hear that one riff before your head explodes or you just have to turn it off?  Give me a break.  They have some good reiffs going, now they just need to get the rest of the songs going."}

Check it out when ya fry, (call a radiostation and ask if they will play Daft Punk's Around The World). I say 100% of this album is good. Any questions e-mail me at yuckplace@hotmail.com ."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "First of all, if you are new to Daft Punk, mostly because of Random Access Memories or the Tron: Legacy soundtrack and looking for more of there music; and you are not otherwise into electronica /house/techno, this is not a good place for you to start.  Your next album should probably be Discovery, as that's the closest thing to DP's more recent work in there back catalog.  If you can't get into that, you'd be advised to just stop there.This debut album is really early-- 1997, actually-- and is hard core club music: very loopy, very repetitive and mostly made to dance to.  And very electronic.  That is not to say that it lacks depth, however.  Active listening reveals many surprises and subtleties that make trancing out to it a great experience.  So if you like good electronic music, this needs to be in your collection."}

Besides the No 1s like Straight Up, Forever Your Girl, Opposites Attract and Cold Hearted, I especially like Knocked Out and I Need You. My only beef with this is that they did not put in the version of Cold Hearted which had Paula rapping.Many of of us ended up getting the accompanying VHS too to learn to dance like Paula."}

This album has all the ingredients of a hit: sharp beats, slammin' grooves, and Abdul's whiny voice, which, in a strange way, sounds good.  Standouts include &quot;The Way That You Love Me,&quot; the Babyface-penned &quot;Knocked Out,&quot; and the memorable &quot;Cold Hearted.&quot;  In the age of pale imitators like Britney Spears, we need an artist like Abdul more badly now than ever.

This takes me back to a time when R&amp;B had its innocence, when people sang about LOVE and ROMANCE and wanting to treat you right.  There were no lyrics about &quot;freak&quot; this or &quot;thong&quot; that. This record shows Babyface at one of his peaks as a producer, as he is involved in virtually every track on this CD.  It's difficult for me to point out a standout track since you can play this CD from start to finish without hitting the &quot;next&quot; buttom.  Highly recommended.  After you hear this record, you'll never want to listen to anything that's been released in the last 18 months."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of those bands that I can simply not compare to anyone. But sometimes those are the best ones. It's a great album from my senior year, that is probably better than I can put into words. My favorite song is &quot;Sweethearts&quot;. It's just got great guitar work, and an overall happy strummin' melody. Violin adds alot to many of these songs as well, especially on the great track &quot;Pictures Of Matchstick Men&quot;. They do it very well. Other cool songs are &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;All Her Favorite Fruit&quot;. After this album, &quot;David Lowery&quot; went on to do &quot;Cracker&quot;, and I think &quot;Morgan Fichter&quot; worked some with &quot;10,000 Maniacs&quot; and &quot;Jane's Addiction&quot;. But overall, not much satisfies like &quot;Key Lime Pie&quot;."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Break up albums have that distinct charm of not caring that allows one to relax and bare their soul.  It also finds bands gripping at something they once had but not quite reaching it.  Like the Smiths &quot;Strangeways Here We Come&quot;, another good breakup album, there are good tracks and forgettable material alike.Their political side is highlighted in the mysterious &quot;Jack Ruby&quot;.  &quot;Laundromat&quot; rocks and contains one of their best lines : &quot;Just give me some tension release.&quot;  Their are some nice moments on side two.  The uplifting spring heralding &quot;June&quot;, and the lovelorn &quot;All Her Favorite Fruit&quot;.  I do enjoy this album, but there is  an inconsistency to it that just makes me want for more."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "More Like 4.5 Stars. It is not a perfect record, but it is very unique and creative.  Key Lime Pie is slower than the albums before this one.  Dave Lowery writes witty and ironic lyrics which can make you think, laugh, or actually picture the scene for yourself.  The violin is absolutely soothing, even on the raunchy The Humid Press of Days. Borderline and I was born in a Laundromat are two best cuts. When I win the Lottery is down right hilarious.  This album will take time, so don't make your conclusion after the first or second listen. Let Key Lime Pie seep into your bloodstream and enjoy. Dave Lowery and CVB are genius! I will have the pleasure of purchasing New Roman Times when I get the chance.  Excellent!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Good late '80's independent college rock title. Camper Van Beethoven has never been one of my favorites but I've always liked their name. As fate would have it, I got to catch them at a special radio station show play a club for like $1.05. This being CVB's fifth CD, it's the title of theirs that I do like the best. Tracks that are always nice to hear again {whenever I pull this disc} out for a spin are the edgy \"Jack Ruby\", \"When I Win The Lottery\", \"All Her Favorite Fruit\" and their superbly done cover of Status Quo's \"Pictures Of Matchstick Men\". Got to hang out with their violinist Morgan Fichter after the show. Also saw her like a couple of years later on tour with Jane's Addiction. Pretty sure that was her."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I got a chance to see Julia live in 1994, and the concert she gave still  ranks in my all time top 10 that I have been at. This is the CD that got me  started with Julia. I was familiar with Happy Ever After from the video,  but Porcelain is much better than her first release. I think that  Porcelain, Falling Forward and East-West are all pretty damn good and rate  5 stars each.  She got a lot more air play and video play 10 years ago. I  wonder why she fell out of favor with VH1?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I think Neneh Cherry is underrated. Certainly underappreciated. Since  1989's &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot;, &quot;Kisses on the Wind&quot; and  &quot;Heart&quot;, Neneh Cherry has been mainly forgotten in America. I  think 1992's Homebrew is the best of her three cds. It has great songs like  &quot;Buddy X&quot;, &quot;Peace in Mind&quot;, &quot;Red Paint&quot;,  &quot;Move With Me&quot;, &quot;Trout&quot;, &quot;Ain't Gone Under  Yet&quot; and &quot;Money Love.&quot; This is a great hip-hop/r&amp;b cd  that was generally overlooked by the public. A must have for any rock  collector."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Maybe not so much now, but when this album came out Lenny was the man! If \"5\" isn't his most popular album, this is. The title track and video was everywhere, rightly so. I like the first two albums a bit more, but this is still solid. \"Believe\" was another cool single, and I really think \"Heaven Help\" is a smooth song. No hits in the back of this album, but I still think it's almost as strong as the first half. I think the following album Circus was good too, but this was so huge it made Circus seem like it failed. Anyway, groovy album man."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "to me this is his best album and where he was making a statement. the title  track alone  made him appear to be on to bigger and Brighter things. musically he continued what he had started on his first couple of albums and just fleshed it out more. he always wore his Influences  and Heroes on his sleeves left and right, however he was on point with this album.  this set has rare outtakes and interview and other rare things on it.  his music Collaborator  Craig Ross held it down on guitar and Cindy Blackmon threw down on drums. back then Lenny  had a tough band behind him. he started to find a groove on this album and while his 5th album blew him up, to me this is his best album and to me he never reached those heights of where he was going quite again, however this album worked real good for  him as a  Artist."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Are You Gonna Go My Way firmly established Lenny Kravitz as a major rock star.  With the alt-rock scene at its peak in 1993, Mr. Kravitz's straight ahead rock sound stood out from the crowd.  Although he has been criticized for mimicking the sounds of artists like The Beatles, Sly Stone, Led Zeppelin and others, he plays his music with reverence towards his influences.  He takes those sounds and makes them his own.  The title track opens the album up and it is a cacophony of wicked guitar riffs, sledgehammer drums, pulsating bass and powerhouse vocals.  A truly great rock song.  &quot;Believe&quot; is an airy, mystical number while &quot;Black Girl&quot; is a funky come on.  &quot;Sugar&quot; is a stellar track as &quot;Just Be A Woman&quot;.  Are You Gonna Go My Way is a top notch effort."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It's a shame 'cause Depeche Mode used to be such a great band - it was even THE band back in my gymnasium times.What a pity to release such a sleepy album. The instrumentation on 'Ultra' is pretty inventive but most of the songs do lack positivity and maybe even musical willingness. You simply get sleepy, 'cause they're all in the same far too slow atmosphere.Especially the hit single 'Barrel Of A Gun' is embarrassingly boring. Not worth the former Depeche Mode quality stamp.Only highlights are 'It's No Good' which COULD make it to a 'Best Of' compilation, and 'Freestate', especially its crispy guitar.Depeche Mode needs to work on this adjusted style. It can work. But it'll TAKE some work!A big compliment though for sending 'Ultra' out on vinyl too!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Seriously.  Just crank that puppy, and thrill to the way its glorious swooping bassline makes your subwoofer earn its living, and to the way it glides from DM's trademark minor key into major and back again, and to the way that it all just sounds so effortless.It clearly wasn't, of course.  These guys (now minus Alan Wilder) went through some well-publicized ugly times to get to the point that they were able to pull off _Ultra_ -- but they also managed to move beyond the stifling cynicism of _Songs of Faith and Devotion_ and come up with something catchy, cathartic, and occasionally quite moving.  I'd rank it right up there with _Violator_, _Black Celebration_, and (if I may plug a largely overlooked personal favorite) Mesh's _Who Watches Over Me?_ among the best albums ever released within its genre."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "As far as pop music is concerned, Depeche Mode is one of my favotites (The Pet Shop Boys is my other favorite).  Ever since Black Celebration (i am not a big fan of their earlier material) they have been creating great  songs with memorable music and good, at times very dark lyrics.  Although  many songs on this CD  have a sad tone, most  of them have positive themes  like hope,love, and gratitude.  Occasional touches of electronica are nice  too."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "On Brilliant Corners, the music was as challenging as anything he had done in the past, but now the public seemed to be ready for what he was doing. Many consider this the album to be a masterpiece, and rightly so. Max Roach's drumming on the title track sounds great--tight, and full of impact. &quot;Pannonica&quot; made its debut on this album, and features Monk on both piano and celeste at the same time. Originally recorded on the spur of the moment to fill space on the album, the tender &quot;I Surrender, Dear&quot; sounds like you're right there in the studio. &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; is a bit sloppy, but Roach's tympani playing stands out much more than it did on the OJC version. The only problem I noticed here is a click at the beginning of the title track. Aside from that, it sounds fabulous."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This cd is an amazing document. If this was the only surviving artifact of the 20th century, of human civilization tout cour, then future races and alien species will undoubtedly be in agreement (however naively) that we were giants, that we, as a people, humans, earthlings, had emotional depth, a refined aesthetic sense, humour, intellectual refinement, and anything else you would want and hope for in sentient beings. The music here is perfect, sublime, peerless in its execution, epic in its scope, minute and detailed like the most finely wrought baroque trifle. Everything that it is to live and die in this world finds expression and reflection here. Unbelievable. Unforgettable. Unsurpassed. (100stars!!!!!!!!!)I don't know where I find some of the words contained here, anyway ..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Man, this is one great CD. This and \"Straight No Chaser\" are my two favorite Monk titles, and Monk is my favorite jazz artist. It doesn't get much better than this for me - until I came across this SACD hybrid version. I love it! They obviously remastered the CD using DSD (instead of just grabbing the latested PCM remaster and sticking it on the disc along with the SACD layer) because this CD layer blows every other remaster of this title out of the water. It's 1957, this is one of the first stereo jazz recordings made, and they got it right."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Widely hailed as a masterpiece, but to me it's just another good Monk album. This does contain my favorite version of my favorite Monk song, an extended \"Well, You Needn't\" features numerous memorable solos: there's also a tender if slightly overlong \"Ruby My Dear\" and a swinging, fun \"Off Minor\"; there's also a painfully cheesy, thankfully brief \"Abide with Me\" (still, those are some unbearable 55 seconds), and rather unenlightening takes on \"Epistrophy\" (a remake of an old Blue Note single - the Blue Note take is far better, I can say that without any doubt whatsoever) and \"Crepscule with Nellie\" (which would later get several more touching readings on future Monk albums, most notably Criss Cross). So while it's a distinctive good time, and has a great cover, it's not as solid as several other Monk releases. Still pretty good, though."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Taken from three distinct recording sessions - with bassist Percy Heath being the only consistent sideman - the album was released in 1954.Featuring musicians like Kenny Clarke (d), Art Blakey (d), Horace Silver (p) and Charles Mingus (p), the material is from May 19, 1953; March 15, 1954 and April 3, 1954. The eight tracks clock in at 30:05, with Miles Ahead and the title track edging away from the tight pack of quality music.The playing may not be fast and furious, but the sound is smooth as Miles is churning out cool grooves."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "&quot;Straight Ahead&quot; is the third and final collaboration between tenor saxophonist and noted arranger Oliver Nelson, and iconoclastic reedman Eric Dolphy.  The first was Nelson's &quot;Screamin' The Blues&quot; also on the Prestige label, and the second was the famous &quot;Blues and the Abstract Truth,&quot; recorded for Impulse a week earlier than &quot;Straight Ahead.&quot;  On March 1, 1961 Nelson and Dolphy went into the studio for the third time, along with Richard Wyands on piano, George Duvivier on bass and Roy Haynes on drums.  Five of the album's six tunes are Nelson originals (&quot;Ralph's New Blues is a Milt Jackson composition), with &quot;Images&quot; and the title-track the standouts.  The results were magical on this session, but not quite as impressive as the Impulse date.  All the same, fans of Nelson and Dolphy will enjoy plotting this course &quot;Straight Ahead.&quot;"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "right from the opening tones of &quot;if i were a bell,&quot; miles and  company (the classic quintet with john coltrane, red garland, paul  chambers, and philly joe jones) set the tone for a quietly swinging set of  cool jazz. miles continued to explore his own version of cool jazz (much  more bop oriented than west coast jazz), but here the sound is becoming  even more uncategorizable, more distinctly miles' own voice and timbre. he  explores melody and themes finding his own phrasing and expansions, leaving  plenty of room for the song to develop as it will. in sum, he uses silence  as part of the form, like ahmad jamal, for instance, creating tension and  setting fires within the tune. the band is stellar and one can hear  coltrane getting his own voice, as well, laying the foundations for what  was to come in a few years. well worth any price!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The 1954 album Bags Groove by Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants, who feature Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins, among others, is one of the best albums of the Miles Davis' early career. The band is incredible, with some of the top musicians of the time and of all time. The songs Doxy and But Not For Me are the least impressive songs on the album and aren't very strong, which slightly hurts the album, but not too much. The title track is great with some inspired trumpet playing by Miles. The two Sonny Rollins tunes, Airegin and Oleo are the highlights of the album. Both are really great songs that would become standards for both Sonny Rollins and Miles Davis. True, this is not the best album by Miles Davis, and maybee not even one of the best. It is still great, however, and is worth it just to hear Miles and Sonny soloing being backed by Monk."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I just received this remastered classic from Amazon and it is ASTOUNDING ! I can't believe it took me so long to pick this up. Miles sounds as good as I've ever heard him and the rest of the musicians are also at their best particularly Milt Jackson on the title track.  Monk sounds a bit tentative and the story is that Miles asked him to sit out while he took his solo but Monk came through when it was his time to comp behind Jackson's solo and take his own solo. He sounds inventive and unmistakably Monk. Horace Silver and Sonny Rollins both sound wonderful and the tracks where they are featured really swing. The heart of this fine CD is the incredible rhythm section of Percy Heath and Keny Clarke. These guys were rock solid throughout this session and with the remastering Heath's bass lines just jump through the speakers.Do not hesitate to purchase this. You will be glad you did."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Wes Montgomery was truely gifted at the guitar. He couldn't read a single note of music but his style was very distinct, he used his thumb to play the guitar, he also used incredible octaves in his style as well as tremendous solo's. Boss Guitar for me was Innovative for any jazz guitarist. It showed Montgomery's creativity as a musician. Besame Mucho is a beautiful song, Dearly Beloved shows Montgomery's creative side, Fried Pies is my favorite, for me it has everything a jazz solo should have octaves, block chords, and tremendous playing from the heart. I recommend this to any guitarist out there weather you play the blues or rock. Try learning these solo's and i guarantee you will be one hell of a great guitarist. This is Highly Recommended!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have had this album in my (more or less) Complete Works of Stan Getz for more than a decade but it hadn't occupied a postion of prominence. But I went back the other day and relistened and I really like it!There are less of Getz wonderful ballads than one often finds in this period but the music is spirited and happy and Getz does a great job of call-and-response to passages Tjader plays first on vibes, for example \"Ginza Samba\". Sounds bounce back and forth from vibes to sax and back again! What a happy, optimistic period this was in music.Fun and high energy from beginning to end. Melodic, relaxed and swinging! Should be more popular. Quite fifties Latin music - Seems to presage Getz Bossa Nova albums, in a vague sense.Well recorded, for it's period.(NOt that it's anyone's business, but I bought this CD before Amazon existed)"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A top ten all time collection of songs in my heart, some of the most fantastic sax on record, hoppingest tunes and heartfelt recording available.  Simply perfect.  I've given five stars to CDs I know are less than perfect, because I love them, but this is pure.  I don't have to tell you all what you already know about Sonny Rollins and this classic release.  We are all lucky Sonny Rollins has stayed with us so long and shared with us so much.  I'd just like to use this public space to thank Sonny again personally for his kindness in taking the time after a fabulous energy-draining virtuoso performance at Kannai Hall, Yokohama, in May '97, to sign this CD and take photos with me and a friend.  These treasures make me proud.  Thank you Sonny."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This CD is a treat from start to finish. I like the mix of well known and not so well known songs, and I especially like Moritat (\"Mack the Knife\") for its straight forward delivery, true to the original rhythm and swing, and a saxophone solo by Sonny that is unparalleled in recorded jazz history. I've never had any issues with Van Gelder re-mixes, and I can confirm that there are a few blips here and there, but I don't consider them distracting and the music can still be easily enjoyed. Fans of sax jazz simply must buy this recording, and I don't see how any serious fan of jazz can be without it. If you are looking for something to broaden a non-jazz oriented music collection, I think this might be a good candidate for you, simply because the music is so much fun. Let 'er rip!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Without a doubt, one of the five best jazz albums ever made is this 1956 masterpiece. Recorded in a single day at Rudy Van Gelder's living room/studio, Sonny Rollins earned his place as a legend with &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot;. Aided and abetted by powerhouse drummer Max Roach, pianist Tommy Flanagan, and bassist Doug Watkins, the quartet plays with the precision of a chamber orchestra, and swings just as hard. It's not very often that you hear an album where the musicians are so in tune with each other. From the breezy sway of &quot;St. Thomas&quot; to the final notes of &quot;Blue 7&quot;, Rollins and company shows how it should be done. This newly remastered edition finally sounds as great as the original vinyl pressing but without the hefty price you'll shuck out for an original copy. No serious jazz fan should be without a copy of this amazing album in their collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny Rollins was at the time of this recording one of the greatest and most innovative tenorists. Today his stature is possibly somewhat overshadowed by that of John Coltrane, as Coltrane's individualism and innovative powers are very obvious. In his own way, though, Rollins also made a very important contribution as an innovator - perhaps especially in his handling of rhythm. In any case, he was certainly one of the most satisfying tenor players of his time, with a hard drive on up-tempo tracks, and melodious (never sentimental) lyricism on slower numbers. His phrasing was always interesting, articulate, and musical. This is an excellent record which shows him to great advantage, e.g. in \"St Thomas\" and \"Moritat\", though I personally think he is even more exciting when heading the trio on \" A Night at the Village Vanguard\", as, in truth, no pianist could really match him satisfactorily as a soloist, and he does not need a piano as an accompaniment. - Joost Daalder"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny Rollins , considered by many to be the quintessential live performer, admittedly felt restricted in a studio. However listening to his masterpiece Saxophone Colossus it is clear that he was on this occasion  able to capture some of the energy of a live performance on vinyl. The record is a tour-du-force of Rollins musical vision and mastery of improvisational inventiveness within a melodic and harmonic form that draws the listener in chorus after chorus.Max Roach's drumming drives every track particularly the classic St Thomas. Roach and Rollins trade 4's on Blue 7 and play off of each other beautifully throughout. Tommy Flanagan's piano playing is subtle and perfectly suited to this group.This is my favorite Rollins recording other than those made with Clifford Brown and Max Roach's group."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is one of the best ever Jazz albums, recorded by one of the top five tenor players in Jazz history.The other musicians are:Tommy Flanagan - PianoDoug Watkins - BassMax Roach - drumsEven if you're not a Jazz fan you'll know Sonny Rollins 'St Thomas' which opens the album, with its calypso melody its one of the best known Jazz tunes. The performances are uniformly excellent and the sound is incredible since this album was recorded 50 years ago.The track 'Moritat' is in fact 'The theme from the three penny opera', but it sounds remarkably similar to 'Mack the Knife'. Whatever the tune really is, Rollins is never less throughly inventive, as anyone who has seen him live will testify to. This track perhaps contains the highlight of the album, where Sonny Rollins trades 4's with Max Roach.This is one of the classic Jazz albums and should be in everyones collection."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I'll weigh in on the Rollins vs. Coltrane issue.  When I first discovered jazz 30 years ago I fell under the Coltrane spell.  I couldn't get enough of him, wore out two copies of Live at the Village Vanguard.  As I got older I began to prefer the clarity of ideas, mastery of rhythm and melodic storytelling of the great Sonny Rollins.  Now there is no contest.  I agree with those who believe that Sonny is the greatest improviser of the last 50 years, or more.  Every cut on Saxophone Colossus is a jewel.  Blue 7 was famously analyzed by musicologist Gunther Schuller as a model of almost architectural structure in improvised music.  I prefer to think of it as melodic storytelling.  Nobody does it better than Sonny Rollins.  This record is one of the finest in jazz, in 1956, now or 100 years from now."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny Rollins' \"Saxophone Colossus\" is one of those albums that you could listen to 20 times in a row and never tire of because it's just that good. I've owned this recording for a couple of years and I still return to it from time to time. Rollins' warm, round tone makes this album the masterpiece it is, but that's not to discount his group for this session: Tommy Flanagan on piano, Doug Watkins on bass, and Max Roach on drums, who provide excellent support. This is a classic for reason. Want to find out why? Pick this up today. An essential jazz recording."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Chet Baker - Sings...It Could Happen To You. 180g vinylEvery trumpet player is really a singer...they just sing thru their instrument but on &#34;It Could Happen To You&#34; Chet actually uses his voice!This album is way too cool and relaxed.......lounge meets cool jazz !  On this album Chet picked 10 standards of the day and used his voice as a trumpet!  But there are no &#34;Bla Bla's or nonsense syllables here just Chets soft voice singing as if he was playing trumpet  ."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Sonny was in his absolute prime when he cut Way Out West. No tennor ever had a better tone than &quot;Newk&quot;, and that includes some very exclusive company, (Clotrane, Getz, Shorter, etc.) The painstaking remastering job here brings out the brillance of his majestic sound. To me Sonny's pharsing has always had the same inherent rhythem as the great post-war singers like Sinatra and Tony Bennett. Without a single bad note or overstated pharse, Way Out West is some of the best hard-bop you'll ever hear. Fortunately Sonny is still going strong and at seventy-something he is still producing vital music for us to enjoy."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Although not as strong and flowing as the superb \"Saxophone Colussus\" this record still contains some very good tracks. In particular I liked the swinging songs of \"I'm an Old Cowhand\", \"Wagon Wheels\" amd \"Way Out West\" which showcase some great solos from Sonny Rollins.Bassist Ray Brown and Drummer Shelly Manne make worthy contributions with some excellent solos of their own in the rhythm section but feel a little dissapointed with the absence of piano or guitar. When listening to all the songs it sometimes feels in my opinion as if there is something missing eventhough Sonny's playing is mostly wonderful."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "\"Way Out West\" was a very different sounding recording for its time, as was Rollins' \"Freedom Suite.\" I have given this album several listens and just find the whole thing on a musical level to be quite technically great, but the overall quality of the music is empty, because of the absence of a chordal instrument (i.e. piano, guitar). Perhaps many people don't need to hear the chords, but I always liked chords in music. I feel that they help round out the overall sound. If you like Sonny Rollins, this is still an album worth picking up just to hear what it is, a very different record for Rollins. If you're interested in hearing Rollins playing against chords in a fuller band check out his albums \"Saxophone Colossus\" and \"Tenor Madness.\" You can't go wrong with these."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Some excellent reviews of this album that cover all you need to know about the music ... so all I can do is agree! Truly, as others have noted, this was a daring, revolutionary album when it was released. Innovative production and puutting out songs that took up the whole side of an album? Insane ... and brilliant. This was a true immersion in soul magic, hot buttered, funky, and silky smooth. My only knock against this \"Anniversary\" edition is the fact that the \"Bonus\" tracks are simply two single edits of tracks already on the album. Come on, record company weasels, give us something truly special or rare! If you make us buy an album/CD we already own, at least justify another purchase with something really extra. That gripe aside, this remains a wonderful listening experience."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I have been a Mobile Fidelity fan for years.  To be sure their product is always top shelf.  This release is no exception...it beats the socks off of the regular issue in terms of musical presentation.  Still, this recording would shine in 5.1 surround, so come on MoFi, give us a 5.1 presentation.  Sure I know your contract with Sony (CBS) prohibits you from releasing 5.1 CDs of their products, but this is NOT a CBS product.  If you got the original master tapes, getting the original 8 track master would not be much more difficult.  Please try a little harder next time."}

This sprawling masterwork (containing only 4 tracks) is still an impressive LP more than 30 years after it's release and dozens of other soul/rock artists followed the path Hayes laid down. There is not a moment wasted here and Hayes proves himself to be a writer, arranger, composer and player without peer.Essential Listening."}

The Barkays and the precursors to the Movement? Awesome. Get it and blow your mind."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Like most 1970s Isaac Hayes albums, To Be Continued mines the revolutionary direction the Black Moses laid withHot Buttered Soulin 1969--taking pop songs and making them into huge, funk-orchestral odes.On Hot Buttered, this was unprecidented. To Be Continued is almost as good. But the hard funk edges here are beviled down, in favor of lush balladry essays. This is certianly a viable direction, and it is amazing to hear Hayes carve out huge caverns of sound from consice AM pop tunes.If the funky spikes had been maintained, at least for a number or two, this may have made for a better album, but for technique and the massive arranging talent that was Isaac Hayes, its hard to argue against this album"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album, like its two predecessors defined Ike's work.  He shows his continued ability (having already proven himself an first rate writer) to take great songs in their own right and rearrange them to make them new and  different classics.  &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is a masterpiece, which  must give its creators new found pride.  However, there is no song like  &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling&quot;:  Sure enough a great work by  the Righteous Brothers.  A whole 'nother smoke when Ike puts his inimatable  stamp on it.A worthy successor to Hot Buttered Soul, and The I.H.  Movement.  Like those (unlike what followed) no filler."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember hearing \"Woman to Woman\" when it hit the Top 40 back in 1975. Good song, but it didn't particularly rock my world. And I think that was the last time I heard much from Shirley Brown. But she kept recording music, most of it very good by all accounts, and when I saw this album pop up in a local shop recently, memories of 1975 came bursting back and I thought: why not buy it? Well, I did and I'm very, very happy that I finally listened to more than one song by Shirley Brown. Wow, what a voice! Why wasn't she up there with Aretha, knocking down the soul barricades during the rest of the 1970s? Some really great songs on here, many with much more sass and oomph than \"Woman to Woman.\" Soul fans, check this one out. Very impressive album."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Back in 2005, one of my favorite artists by the name of Jaguar Wright re-made the song \"Woman To Woman\" on her album, Divorcing Neo 2 Marry Soul. I instantly fell in love with the song and I just had to hear the original. So I bought this the other day.Before listening to the album straight through, I had to cheat and listen to her version. No disrespect to Ms. Wright, but... there's just no comparison! Shirley is an amazing soul singer and she delivers the lyrics with true skill, expression and class. Why is she not more well-known?! Going through the rest of the album, I loved it just as much as the title track. I especially enjoyed \"It Ain't No Fun.\" When Shirley speaks in her songs, it really feels genuine, unscripted and exclusive. This is a great 70's soul album and I highly recommend it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This release reflects the creative minded artist roster that STAX created during it's heyday. The concept was right and the music is quite inspiring on this collection,theirs not much that can be said that has'nt already about this 1970 classic,however I would like to add that although Booker T Jones was and still is one of the grooviest Hammond B-3 players around he is also a very underrated Blues Pianist as he has displayed throught his career. Anyone interested in more STAX should check out oneline(or visit as I have) the STAX museum in Memphis,check out their website."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Damn!  When the sax comes in at the climax (no pun intended)of &quot;Help Me Love&quot; you just have to take your lover in your arms and dance.  This is just one of so many brilliant moments to be found in the two sprawling discs of &quot;Black Moses.&quot;  Isaac Hayes' orchestrations and musical conceptions transcend any notion of the 1970s or &quot;soul music&quot; for that matter.  The much-sampled &quot;Ike's Rap&quot; movements deserve special mention as well.  You need this in your life."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "I keep hearing from Eric Clapton and many others that Freddie King is this hot blues guitar player. Well, I have been picking up his records inexpensively as I find them.I must be buying the wrong albums--later ones--because like Buglar, the Freddie King I have found is more rock inflected funk R&B.;But I have said the wrong word when I said \"wrong\" Freddie King albums, because from what I hear, these will do just fine.This album is funky, creamy blues funk, played by a master musician with a master backing band. I love King's ability to form potent leads out of a few notes. Like any King bluesman or great guitar player, Freddie has an amazing talent for taking a small pattern, and just ringing the hell out of it. Minimum playing, but maximum emotion.His voice is just amazing. Pure blues and soul.If I knew Freddie like others know Freddie. Well, with albums like this, beleive me, it won't be too long."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "A very good blues album. I borrowed it from a friend along with 5 or 6 other CDs (Johnny Winter, etc.) -- and I played this CD much more than the others. I am a big fan of Freddy's guitar playing -- but it is the vocals that really captivated me with this album. He does this thing with his voice, it is hard to describe but he seems to hold a note and then increase its volume (any vocalists out there?) -- I had never heard this before and was fascinated by it. I found myself singing along trying to imitate it (pretty funny as I really can't sing)! Anyway I had a uniquely inspired blues-jam guitar lesson immediately after that -- my guitar teacher was blown away.  The \"vibe\" just sank in on the drive in.  Can't be bad.  I prefer this original album over some of the Freddy King compilations and collections that are available (I own 2 of those currently!). Recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "If you have heard of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Johnson, Walter Trout, Johnny Lang or Joe Kubek; Ask where does their music come from? Most probably the answer is: Freddie King; Burglar.In this album, Freddie sets the standards of any guitar used in a blues or a rock song.A 1972 release, shortly before his death, this album will blow your mind and ears away. No other blues album of its generation comes close; and this is nothing like Fredddie's previous releases.I believe that Freddie King ranks in Blues the same as Miles Davis in Jazz. Too bad he died too soon.Highly recommended."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "It seems to me that in 1966 Donovan was already in that special asteral plane The Beatles, Stones, Beach Boys and everyone else was seeking to be. Sunshine Superman and Mellow Yellow were but glimpses of the cosmic landscape Donovan would lay on us in A Gift From A Flower To A Garden. And if that was not enough, the addition of For Little Ones, is as near a perfect compilation of charming English childrens songs, as can be found this side of Atlantis. In a world full of tinkers, magpies, enchanted gypsies and starfish, Donovan resides as the man-child truberdour strumming his guitar and banjo as he sings us all to sleep."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This was one of the first albums I'd every purchased. From here I went on to collect most of Donovan's songs, and then later do it again. This is a fitting title, for it is a gift, still. Donovan, despite losing favor among modern poet-songwriters, is under-appreciated, in my opinion. The 22 songs on this album are among the best composed and released by Donovan. At the time this was originally released, in 1967, I found the popular Kahlil Gibran to be exceedingly compatible with thoughts and sentiments expressed by Donovan in song. Those who enjoy one should also enjoy the other."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Obviously, from all the other reviews posted here, there is quite the chasm between the love-or-hate-it listeners.  I am here to comment only on the audio.The original, now out-of-print 1990 Chrysalis-label CD was just an LP-EQ'd master transfered to CD.  The 1997, also now unfortunately OOP UK BGO-label version, was properly remastered for CD, and is head-and-shoulders the superior version of the two.So, if you are going to buy this somewhat controversial album, at least get the version that sounds the best... The BGO."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Originally released in 1968, as this was the Los Angeles short-lived psych band's only record, unfortunately. Wound up liking this CD reissue much better than I had expected. With this Sundazed reissue, you get the lp's initial ten songs + ten more bonus cuts tagged on for good measure. Thoroughly enjoyed a couple of their awesome [undiscovered psychedelic gems] \"Cloud Song\" followed by \"The Garden Of Earthy Delights\", the quirky \"I Won't Leave My Wooden Wife For You, Sugar\", the harmony vocals enriched \"Where Is Yesterday\", the adventurous six-minute ahead-of-it's time \"Stranded In Time\" and \"Metaphor For An Older Man\". Turns out the extra tunes you get on this disc isn't bad either. Recommended for fans of Druids Of Stonehenge, Fifty Foot Hose and early Jefferson Airplane."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Yes, I love this album. This Sundazed version is preferred because of all the bonus tracks and the edifying interviews with Byrd and Moskowitz. And, of course, the sound. The Edsel release is also nice and actually more like the original because the original had no bonus cuts either (!), but it has some booklet comments. Got the virgin vinyl through a mail order house called Records Unlimited--pretty modern for those days, eh? So here we have a few crazy university people manifesting a well-composed and mighty trippy psychedelic record for posterity--and extra credit, I presume. A brilliant odd duck swimming amongst all the less brilliant ducks. A singular creative adventure completely worthy of years of happy listening. Inspiring enough that I even took a whack at playing a couple of these tunes in public. Wanna see faces get weird?"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Yes, we all know many of the big name late 60's West Coast Rock bands, many which rarely got much above mediocrity. This group, hardly known then and less so today, recorded some of the finest, most interesting, and original songs right here on this, their only (I think) album!.What we have here is a mixture of really original melodies, poetic lyrics, fine arrangements. and singing/ harmonies that still hold up well! Listen to the quasi-spiritual WHERE IS YESTERDAY, and you'll know exactly what I mean!.Same with CLOUD SONG, EARTHLY DELIGHTS, and most of the others, including a circus like/vaudevillian number as well! Even with 2 or 3 duds, the rest is as good anything from that era, including the similar sounding Jeff Airplane, and the 1960's summit, the Beatles!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton is super sexy and with an equally seductive voice. Her debut was a perfect introduction to the R&B; world. While I think Secrets is her best work Toni Braxton is also impressive.Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again are super hits. Enough said. Love Affair, Seven Whole Days, Love Shoulda Brought you Home and my fav You Mean the World to Me are all highlights.The reason I rated this 4 stars is the other songs are okay I guess but I usually skip. The Cd can get moody and depressing without a true uptempo song.If your looking for Classic Toni look at Secrets!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This is a very good album for many reasons.  Babyface's songwriting and producing skills have never been better than on this cd.  Toni Braxton's voice is showcased in all its majesty on this disc as well.  No filler tracks here as every song is a joy to listen to.  You almost feel sad when the end comes with the \"Breathe Again (Reprise)\" a very good way to end the album.  The sound quality is very good and it's not even remastered yet!  Makes me wonder what a remastered version would sound like if the original already sounds this good.  Highly recommended if you like r&b."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "One of the best albums of the 90s, this album had some of the most momentous crossover appeal ever. During its first couple of years it was all over black urban radio, yet it was tastefully restrained enough to have continued success on adult contemporary and soft rock radio stations to this day. \"Another Sad Love Song\", \"Breathe Again\", \"You Mean The World To Me\", \"How Many Ways\" and \"Seven Whole Days\" are among the true gems of contemporary R&B. Her next album, Secrets, had a couple of sizable hits and is generally good, if not as brilliant as this. However, after that, she was forced to declare bankruptcy, and since then, her quest to reclaim her wealth has resulted in a series of subpar albums that simply cannot touch the greatness of this one."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "[One CD, with a running time of 53:18] Fifty-three minutes of pure paradise! These twelve songs show off Toni Braxton's silky smooth voice at its best. R&B; or pop, whatever you want to call these songs, all are smooth, quiet, and easy to listen to love songs that make for some excellent slow dancing. My favorites are Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again. But, all of the songs on this CD are excellent!As an added bonus, the CD's paperwork contains the words to the songs, plus the back is a nice, small poster. I love extras!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember the duet between Babyface and Miss Braxton, and how impressed I was by her vocal abilities..Then she came out with this album!! Oh my god, the woman tore up each and every song!! With Babyface's lyrics and production and her voice, this was one those perfect producer-artist teams that could do no wrong..I still love this album to this day..Most of the songs on this album are R&B classics anyway..You know an album is great when no matter how dated it sounds, its still listenable..If your a fan of women who have powerful voices, pick up this cd..You cannot go wrong!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "TONI BRAXTON was a smashing debut CD back in the 90s, and still is. Braxton's unique voice combined with original, impossible to label songs like the sexy standout \"Breathe Again\" show what magic first-rate producers like L.A. Reid and Babyface can do with an extraordinary singer. Braxton caresses her lyrics with jazzy, Anita Baker-ish embellishments, slurred phrasing, breathy come-ons, and leaping octaves. She swings, sways, wails and wallops her way through this outstanding showcase. Beautifully sung and still sounds fresh as when it was first released."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "OutKast's debut: \"Southernplayalisticadillacmusik\" is nothing short of fire!  It is a combination of great rhythm, neat lyrics, and bass heavy, early to mid 90's Dirty South G-Funk beats.  This album is great lowrider music. A standout track is \"Ain't No Thang,\" which has really deep head nodding bass, and hard hitting, hot headed gangsta lyrics from the Organized Noize duo!  Some of the beats hint slightly at West Coast G-Funk like \"Claimin' True,\" but even with that, you can see that the deep southern influence is the prevalent as it is throughout.  This album was the launching pad for OutKast's rap and pop success, and rightly so."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Positives: For the most part, this album is straight up Southern funk and good rapping. This is before Outkast got really good but it's still a solid collection of songs. The production is pretty good and you can see the beginning of a strong lyrical duo forming. My favorite track is &quot;Git Up, Git Out&quot; cause I can identify with it.Negatives: Becuase I heard their best album to date, Aquemini, before this one, I expected more in terms of production and lyrics. If I would have heard this album before I heard their more recent stuff, I would have said this album was pretty dope. Overall, this is good Southern rap."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "The combination of Organized Noize, Kast and Goodie Mob made this classic pop back in the summer of 94. This joint put Atlanta on the map for real. Andre came hard lyrically with a New York influenced flow with Big Boi playing cleanup man. Sleepy Brown had the Curtis Mayfield'esque vibe going on. This joint laid the ground work for what would later lead the South dominating rap music.Top Joints:MyintrotoletuknowAin't No Thang  (Hard)SouthernplayalisticadillacmuzikPlayer's Ball (Original)Claimin' TrueFunky RideGit Up, Git Out  (Classic Ceelo chorus.

{"label": 9, "raw": "Secrets by Toni Braxton is her most beloved and best-selling album of her career. This album is pretty good but it's also a mixed bag as well. After a thousand listens to, Un-Break my Heart is just plain nauseating! You're Making Me High is probably her strongest single ever, love those naughty lyrics and pulsating beat. How Could An Angel Break My Heart is a beautiful ballad which was co-written by Braxton. The rest of the songs are pretty ordinary and jeez most of the time I can't understand what she is singing, she needs to enuicate her words. This album is a great flashback to the mid-90s but that's pretty much it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "In 1992,after catching the attention of Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds and current Arista Records president Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid,Toni Braxton landed a contract with Arista's subsidiary label,LaFace. That label,which is a combination of the nicknames,was founded by Edmonds and Reid. When Braxton's debut album was released the following year,she became an instant success. R&B,rap and hip-hop fans fell in love with her talented singing vocals. The most memorable track from this album is UN-BREAK MY HEART,which is of course,smooth R&B. I just love the sound of Edmonds' guitar on that song. When I first heard the song in 1996 when this album was released,I thought it was Gloria Estefan who recorded it since her voice sounds much like Braxton's. That same year,Edmonds produced Eric Clapton's hit CHANGE THE WORLD from the movie PHENOMENON starring John Travolta. The other songs are great. A few years later,Reid would do business with another great artist,Avril LaVigne."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton came out with her sophomore album, Secrets, in June 1996. Toni revealed a more sexier, yet classier image, and it was reflected on each of these songs. A few songs that stand out on the album are the title track, How could an Angel Break My Heart, There's No Me Without You, and You're Making Me High. A few standout ballads would be In the Late of Night, which was written by Jon B. Another ballad that sticks out from this album is Find Me a Man. Secrets is definitely Toni Braxton at her finest. This cd is definitely a good one that shouldn't be kept secret!!!!!!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "I remember this album when I was 9. I love this album. She delivered a record that showcases her maturity while offering a diversity of music sure to appeal to her ever-growing audience of young and old alike. She covered the spectrum while still maintaining her own soulful identity. She had craft an album that has a distinctly personal feel to it.  This album is a glowing testament to her status as one of the decade's most vibrant,exciting,soul deep,straight from the heart young artists. This album allows us listeners the opportunity to witness Toni in an array of musical moods and settings. This album has been certified 8x Platinum. Remember,this was 1996-1997."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni's sophomore set continued her progression from an excellent debut.  This is a strong collection of songs where Toni's vocal phrasings and the song melodies are beautiful from one track to the next.  On the Babyface productions, it's like he & Toni are both halves of one brain - and although more Adult Contemporary than straight R&B;, the songs are still memorable, melodic and beautiful.I saw Toni on a commercial recently which prompted my little Toni-athon and rediscovered singles that I hadn't listened to in a while: THERE'S NO ME WITHOUT YOU, WHY SHOULD I CARE, IN THE LATE OF NIGHT and FIND ME A MAN in addition to the \"hits\" that I love: LET IT FLOW, I LOVE ME SOME HIM, UNBREAK MY HEART & YOU'RE MAKING ME HIGH.Overall this is a great second offering from one of my favorite vocalists who we need to hear more new music from!  Please come back soon, Toni!"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This a a brilliant album from Toni. Beautiful ballads throughout and her voice is so soothing and sultry. My particular favourites are &quot;Un-break my heart&quot; and &quot;How could an Angel break my heart&quot;, but all songs are good. This is an album I can listen to over and over again...beautiful. The 24 page booklet contains all lyrics and plenty of photos of Toni. If you're looking for an album for a romantic dinner or 'something', then look no further. Track #12 though, I think is a trick...it doesn't exist."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Toni Braxton waited 3 years to release her sophomore effort, Secrets, which follows the same formula as its predecessor while managing to sound fresh and new. The big ballad \"Un-break My Heart\" is the obvious smash hit, but other classics include the sultry \"You're Makin' Me High\" and the relaxing \"Let it Flow.\" Smooth album cuts like \"Why Should I Care\" and \"Come on Over Here\" ensure that the album moves with a soulful, slow-burn feel from beginning to end. Secrets is the rare sophomore album that outdoes the artist's debut. 4 Stars."}

{"label": 9, "raw": "From the cool way she sings the word 'find' on the opener &quot;Come On Over Here&quot; to the percussive, bass-heavy track produced by Tony Rich, &quot;Secrets&quot; is an extraordinary piece of ordinary music. While there is nothing especially innovative about it, Toni's second LP is a pleasure from start to finish (save for the horrendous &quot;How Could An Angel Break My Heart&quot; bleccchh!!)and it features one of my favorite Braxton tunes, the half sung/half spoken &quot;Talking In His Sleep&quot; a seductive, percolating jam that features some of her best vocals ever and a brilliantly minimalist track with live drums, keyboards and some wicked wah-wah guitar on the final chorus. &quot;Secrets&quot; is Toni Braxton's finest hour and a testament to the quality pouring out of LaFace Records in the mid 90's."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Tony (Given his start by former NBA player John Salley), may have only experienced true mainstream success on the back of \"Nobody Knows\" but his consistent talent is there to see for those who explore deeper. As Babyface's protege he has written/produced for Boyz II Men, Toni Braxton and Guy. The artistry of real substance however was kept for himself...Yes THAT single is a modern classic and it's sincere emotional value has touched many a heart but the rest of the album is to a similarly high standard.Personal favourites here in Mr Rich's idiosyncratic, smooth, open style include the second single \"Like A Woman\" and the suitably haunting \"Ghost\". Lyrically he is particularly skilled, many miles ahead of his \"R&B;\" contemporaries.There isn't a weak song on the album so if you are inclined to discover truths for yourself and not buy media hype as gospel, explore this album and enjoy the serene beauty of The Tony Rich Project..."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "Along with Aquemini, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. At first this album may seem a little bit out there. When you look at the the cover, they look like some \"aliens or genies. But once you start listening you realize how good songs like \"Wheelz of Steel\" and \"Mainstream\" are. Then the rest of the album just falls into place. People who don't own the album may have heard the radio songs \"ATLiens\" and \"Elevators\". If you think those are good but haven't heard the rest of the album, then you're in for a treat. The rest of the album is just as good and better in many cases. This album is also really good for people who like to blaze it up and listen to some music that will really f#%k with you. Overall it is an excellent album for anybody and if you haven't heard it, I would recommend getting it."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album is Outkast at its finest moment.  This album came out in 96, however, it was so ahead of its time that if you listened to it today, you would not even notice that it is 7 years old.  The beats are futuristic even for todays standards, and the lyrics are extremly thought provoking and hard hitting just like Camacho and Vargas.  I must admit that I am not a fan of Southern hip hop, however, with Outkast and the Goodie Mob I must make an exception.  I believe this album is underrated and should not be missed by anyone.  It is almost a shame that I found this in a 10 dollar bargain bin at Virgin Records."}
{"label": 9, "raw": "ATLiens, in my opinion, is a better CD thanSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzik.  Both are definite hip hop classics, but I have this draw to ATLiens.  I can't explain what it is.The CD is very different from the first.  Where the first was built around the gangster concept, this CD builds its own concept.  One I have yet to put a name to.My favorite songs include Two Dope Boys, ATLiens, Jazzy Belle, Elevators, Babylon, Millenium, and Extra-Terrestrial.Definite Must Have."}

Eyez proves that it has major staying power it is almost always played at any hood party, with everyone their singing the lyrics to every song.  The title track is amazing, with the haunting beat and Pac's exceptional delivery.  &quot;Life Goes On,&quot; &quot;Only God Can Judge Me,&quot; and &quot;Tradin War Stories&quot; let us take a peek a 2Pac's heart, and we found it's one that we related to.

{"label": 9, "raw": "2Pac emerged hardened and hungry with All Eyez on Me, the first double-disc album of original material in hip-hop history. All Eyez on Me is 2Pac the thug icon in all his brazen excess, throwing off all self-control and letting it all hang out -- even if some of it would have been better kept to himself. In that sense, it's an accurate depiction of what made him such a volatile and compelling personality, despite some undeniable filler. On the plus side, this is easily the best production he's ever had on record. Despite some good moments, the second disc is slowed by filler and countless guest appearances, plus a few too many thug-lovin' divas crooning their loyalty. Erratic though it may be, All Eyez on Me is nonetheless carried off with the assurance of a legend in his own time, and it stands as 2Pac's magnum opus"}
{"label": 9, "raw": "This album has everything a rap fan would want. The rapping is straight and has a nice flow. The lyrics are real good and touching. Some of the beats are good as well.

My favorites in the second CD are: \"Can't C Me\", \"Shorty Wanna Be A Thug\", \"When We Ride\", and \"Picture Me Rollin\".
